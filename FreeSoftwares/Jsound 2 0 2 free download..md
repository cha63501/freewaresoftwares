**Using JSound**

JSound is a considerably large program, which is understandable considering
that it combines several applications that are typically found separately.
However, the 90.1MB file installs and launches with relative ease.

When we launched the program for the first time, it required us to choose the
destination path it had to use to copy files in the library. We didnt like the
default skin but were happy to find that it came with many skins from which we
could choose our preference.

The user interface is separated into several parts with different functions:

  * **Upper left** echoes what both left and right speakers play 
  * **Middle left** where you choose the files you want to play and how to handle them 
  * **Lower left** knobs for controlling volume, channels, bass and treble 
  * **Upper right** controls for adjusting play 
  * **Middle right** graphic visualization of whats playing 
  * **Lower right** left and right channel graphic equalizers 
  * **Bottom** buttons for performing various functions and accessing different features, including settings, recording, radio, converter, effects and filter, CD ripper and presets among others 

You can use the music downloader feature by typing artist and title, and the
program will search multiple music sources online. Under Artist Info, you can
find different details about a singer, including biography, blogs, images,
videos, news and reviews. We changed the elaborate graphic equalizer by either
choosing presets or adjusting individual slide bars.

We used JSound to listen to several online radio stations grouped into 24
categories, which were further divided into several sub-categories. The
stations played smoothly although the program took relatively long to buffer
compared to other Internet radio applications we have used.

On the other hand, JSound was on top of its game when it came to audio
conversion. It converted the first file we tried so fast we had to play it to
confirm it was really functional.

**Verdict**

We found JSound to be a great free music player that could perform multiple
functions well.
