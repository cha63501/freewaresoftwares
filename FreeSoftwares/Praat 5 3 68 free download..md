**Publisher's Description**  
  

Application with which phoneticians can analyze, synthesize, and manipulate
speech.

Praat is an application with which phoneticians can analyze, synthesize, and
manipulate speech and create high-quality pictures for their doctoral theses
and articles.

**Here are some key features of "Praat":**

**Speech analysis:**

  * spectral analysis (spectrograms)
  * pitch analysis
  * formant analysis
  * intensity analysis
  * jitter, shimmer, voice breaks
  * cochleagram
  * excitation pattern

**Speech synthesis:**

  * from pitch, formant, and intensity
  * articulatory synthesis

**Listening experiments:**

  * identification and discrimination tests 

**Labelling and segmentation:**

  * label intervals and time points on multiple tiers 
  * use phonetic alphabet 
  * use sound files up to 2 gigabytes (3 hours) 

**Speech manipulation:**

  * change pitch and duration contours 
  * filtering 

**Learning algorithms:**

  * feedforward neural networks 
  * discrete and stochastic Optimality Theory 

**Statistics:**

  * multidimensional scaling 
  * principal component analysis 
  * discriminant analysis 

**Graphics:**

  * high quality for your articles and thesis 
  * produce Encapsulated PostScript files 
  * integrated mathematical and phonetic symbols 

**Programmability:**

  * easy programmable scripting language 
  * communicate with other programs 
  * (the sendpraat source code) 
  * create hypertext manuals with sound I/O 

**Portability:**

  * machine-independent binary files 
  * read and write many sound and other file types 

**Configurability:**

  * grow or shrink menus 
  * save prefs for fonts, views, sound devices.
