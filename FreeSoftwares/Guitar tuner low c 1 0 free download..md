**Publisher's Description**  
  

Guitar Tuner Low C is free to use forever. Tune your guitar by ear and strum
away! Low C is a rare and heavy tuning mostly used for Celtic Folk and Metal.
The bulk of alternate tunings bring a deep resonance and allow for new guitar
chords to be created. Try them all for a new angle on music. Replace old
strings with a medium to heavy gauge set. Heavier strings bring a certain
warmth and make fretting much easier on the the fingers.

**Requires:** [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer/).
