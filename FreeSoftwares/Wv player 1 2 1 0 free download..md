**Publisher's Description**  
  

Play all your avi, wav, midi, mpg, and other multimedia files. May also work
from the command line, to play any file without starting its interface.

Remembers last used directories, has sound control, play list, resize video,
works in kiosk mode, and a lot more.

Can play videos zoomed and full screen, show frame rate and play in slow
motion (not all, just some..), save AVI individual frames as JPG to disk,
etc...

Also has a special kiosk mode that shows the interface centered in the middle
of the screen, with no caption and a few menus disabled, for a few special
uses.

Works with multiple soundcards for playing WAV files, if you are lucky to have
more than one (soundcard) installed - or want to send different voice commands
to different sound interfaces. This works even from the command line.

Has a full play list to were you may add any files you want, and let it play
all unattended, among a few other goodies.
