Guitar Tuner Low C is free to use forever. Tune your guitar by ear and strum away! Low C is a rare and heavy tuning mostly used for Celtic Folk and Metal. The bulk of alternate tunings bring a deep resonance and allow for new guitar chords to be created. Try them all for a new angle on music. Replace old strings with a medium to heavy gauge set. Heavier strings bring a certain warmth and make fretting much easier on the the fingers.
