**Publisher's Description**  
  


Surebo Mediawees is a simple and easy to use Media Player and playlist manager which implements amazing new technologies. 

Beneath this beauty and simplicity lies a powerful media player, while housing the best playlist manager known to man. Using the MDWS playlist file format, we reinvented the playlist. 

Playlist managers, even today, use a simple method to store playlists in files : Remember the Locations of the media files. Using this method prevents you to delete or change the location of the files.

You shouldnt be restricted. MDWS knows that, and stores the media in the playlist file itself, leaving you free to do anything you want with the original media files, and the playlist wont be affected.

A MDWS file is smaller than the original media files, which you can delete - resulting in a smaller-sized music Library, sorted into playlists.
