**Publisher's Description**  
  

iTunes, the award-winning digital-jukebox software, is now available for Mac
and Windows. The iTunes Music Store offers Windows users the same online music
store as Mac users, with the same music catalog, the same personal-use rights,
and the same 99-cents-per-song pricing. With music from all five major music
companies and more than 600 independent labels, the iTunes Music Store catalog
now offers more than 1,000,000 songs.

Features include a free download with no hidden charges for extra features,
MP3 and pristine-quality AAC-encoding from audio CDs, smart playlists, more
than 250 free Internet radio stations, and the ability to burn custom
playlists to CDs and MP3 CDs, to burn content to DVDs to back up an entire
music collection, and to share music via Rendezvous over any network, cross-
platform.

Other features include iMix, which lets you post and e-mail songs in your
playlists for everyone to see, and you can rate iMixes from other music lovers
and discover new music; Party Shuffle, with which you can add, delete, and
rearrange songs on the fly; Apple Lossless, which lets you import music from
CDs and achieve sound quality indistinguishable from the original, at about
