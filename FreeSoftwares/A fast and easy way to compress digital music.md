**Publisher's Description**  
  


Monkeys Audio is a fast and easy way to compress digital music. Unlike traditional methods such as mp3, ogg, or lqt that permanently discard quality to save space, Monkeys Audio only makes perfect, bit-for-bit copies of your music. That means it always sounds perfect exactly the same as the original. Even though the sound is perfect, it still saves a lot of space. (think of it as a beefed-up Winzip for your music) 

The other great thing is that you can always decompress your Monkeys Audio files back to the exact, original files. That way, youll never have to recopy your CD collection to switch formats, and youll always be able to recreate the original music CD if something ever happens to yours.
