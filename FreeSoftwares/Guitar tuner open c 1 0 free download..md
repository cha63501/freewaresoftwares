**Publisher's Description**  
  

Guitar Tuner Open C helps guitarists tune. Tune the guitar by ear and start
playing in Low C for a new sound. Most alternate tunings offer a new sonic
palette to explore, but Open C is the only one that delivers a perfect C major
chord when strumming the strings. This leads to spontaneous songs and cool
riffs. Take your time with this guitar tuner and weave your way through the
low frequencies.
