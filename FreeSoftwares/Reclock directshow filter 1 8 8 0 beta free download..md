**Publisher's Description**  
  

The purpose of ReClock is to definitely get rid of jerky playback of AVI and
MPEG material on a PC (or a HTPC driving a TV, a flat panel, or a video-
projector). Its a DirectShow filter which is loaded in place of the default
directsound audio renderer.

It provides a new reference clock that is locked to the video card hardware
clock, in order to ensure that frames are played at the exact speed of what is
expected by the video card vertical sync.

It also provides a frame rate adapter for media files that do not match a
multiple of the video card refresh rate (ex: playback of 23,976fps IVTC NTSC
on a PAL TV). The combination of the two will give you the true experience of
smooth playback with your PC.

Finally it is an audio renderer with hardware or software rate adaptation in
real-time, multi-channel audio, audio timestretching (pal speedup
compensation) and dynamic range compression capabilities.

For a full description of ReClock, please read carefully the README file in
the distribution. There is also a little FAQ at the bottom of the page that
answers common questions. You can also visit the forums here to meet other
users.
