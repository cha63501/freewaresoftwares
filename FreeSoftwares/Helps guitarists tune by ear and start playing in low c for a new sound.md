**Publisher's Description**  
  


Guitar Tuner Open C helps guitarists tune. Tune the guitar by ear and start playing in Low C for a new sound. Most alternate tunings offer a new sonic palette to explore, but Open C is the only one that delivers a perfect C major chord when strumming the strings. This leads to spontaneous songs and cool riffs. Take your time with this guitar tuner and weave your way through the low frequencies. 

**Requires:** [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer/).
