Pidgin is a multi-protocol instant messaging client for Linux, BSD, MacOS X,
and Windows. It is compatible with AIM (Oscar and TOC protocols), ICQ, MSN
Messenger, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and and more chat networks.

Pidgin users can log in to multiple accounts on multiple IM networks

(coming soon), away messages, typing notification, and MSN window closing
notification. It also goes beyond that and provides many unique features. A
few popular features are Buddy Pounces, which give the ability to notify you,
send a message, play a sound, or run a program when a specific buddy goes
away, signs online, or returns from idle; and plugins, consisting of text
replacement, a buddy ticker, extended message notification, iconify on away,
and more.
