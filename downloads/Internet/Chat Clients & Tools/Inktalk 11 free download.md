**Publisher's Description**  
  

InkTalk is a PowerToy for the Tablet PC that allows you to chat with another
InkTalk client over the internet using your natural handwriting. You can
simply write your message and the other InkTalk client will see your message
in your original handwriting.

You can copy and paste ink to and from other ink-enabled applications like
Windows Journal and also save your messages as a GIF file or as text file
provided that operating system has a text-recognition engine (a real Tablet PC
does, while the Tablet PC SDK does not).

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/de
tails.aspx?FamilyId=262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3&displaylang=en) or
