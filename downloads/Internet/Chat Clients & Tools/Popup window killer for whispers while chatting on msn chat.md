**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program is a popup window killer, specifically for unwanted Whisper windows while chatting on http://chat.msn.com. The program uses a text file to know which windows to close. 

For example, if "bots" are flooding you with Whispers advertising their latest web site, just add "http://" to this programA's text file, and anytime a Whisper window pops up with a link in it, it will be automatically closed. 

No more hitting "Ignore" hundreds of times during a chat session! The program sits in your computerA's System Tray, and flashes when windows are closed. Let your mouse hover over the icon in the System Tray to see how many "bots" have been killed (Windows closed by the program) during the current session.
