**Publisher's Description**  
  

IRCFree started originally around 1995 under many other nicknames and project
titles. ItA's main aim is to develop a fully functional free IRC client for
Windows platforms. While providing a similar, compatible interface to IRC
(like other leading shareware products) IRCFree will have other extensions and
enhancements to open up IRC to a whole new world of features and ideas.
IRCFree is currently BETA software which means that it has passed the "Alpha"
(experimentation) stage and is ready for public testing. It should be not
treated as a final or commercial product, itA's not.
