IRCXpro Messenger is the first of its kind. It is an IRC/IRCX client that looks exactly like an Instant Messenger. 

IRCXpro Messenger supports all common IRC client functionality from full color support to DCC Send/Resume and DCC Chat. IRCXpro Messenger comes complicate with its own Contacts list where you can add your buddyAs and see when they are online / offline and Channel Operators can take advantage of the Operator Panel for quick and convenient access. 

The client software is designed to run from the System Tray. So if someone sends you a message, the system tray icon flashes with a chat bubble and a double click will quickly open the message window for that person.
