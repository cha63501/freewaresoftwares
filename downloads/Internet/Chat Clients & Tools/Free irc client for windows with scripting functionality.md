**Publisher's Description**  
  


IRCFree started originally around 1995 under many other nicknames and project titles. ItA's main aim is to develop a fully functional free IRC client for Windows platforms. While providing a similar, compatible interface to IRC (like other leading shareware products) IRCFree will have other extensions and enhancements to open up IRC to a whole new world of features and ideas. IRCFree is currently BETA software which means that it has passed the "Alpha" (experimentation) stage and is ready for public testing. It should be not treated as a final or commercial product, itA's not.
