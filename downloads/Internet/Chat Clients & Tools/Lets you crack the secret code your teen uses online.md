Kids have their own special language. They always have. Each generation develops itA's own slang, and parents have always been "clueless" to what it all means. ItA's really no different today. Kids still have their own special way of communicating, but with the invention of the Internet, chat rooms, text messaging technologies like Instant Messenger, and text to text cell phone messages, parents can and do get hopelessly lost in the jargon. 

ItA's easy to use and best of all itA's free. Plus, the Teen Chat Decoder software does NOT contain any popups, spyware, ad tracking cookies and does not install any 3rd party software or cookies during installation. Find out what your children are really saying online.
