The MSN Toolbar Suite combines several great programs that speed up your
search tasks and help you surf the Web. ThereA's now an MSN Toolbar for
Microsoft Office Outlook, the MSN Deskbar in the Windows taskbar, and an MSN
Toolbar that works in both Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer. With
Toolbars in these three places, you can start your search and find your pages
more quickly than ever before.
