Auction Explorer is the first and only Internet Explorer Add-on for eBay. Now you have access to the advanced eBay search features right from within Internet Explorer while you are browsing eBay. Easily save and navigate searches on your terms. You can even sync your eBay Watches and Bids with one click access! The eBay Toolbar was not enough for me, I needed more details when IA'm researching and bidding and Auction Explorer for eBay does that for me. 

Auction Explorer currently has the following great features, which includes:

  * Works right within Internet Explorer! One click access to the hidden search features on eBay. 
  * Auction Explorer will save you over 15 mouse clicks when trying to duplicate the searches on eBay! 
  * Regional Searches by Postal Code! 
  * Look at a whole category like eBay Motors by Postal Code! 
  * International Support: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom, United States. More to come! 
  * Many search combinations available and the ability to save those searches for later use! 
  * Remembers your search preferences so you can quickly search eBay for your favorite items on your terms! 
  * Sync your eBay Watches and Bids right from within the add-on Bar none, this is the best add-on to Internet Explorer and eBay. 
  * This is better than the eBay Toolbar! 
  * More features are under development. 
  * It is FREE!
