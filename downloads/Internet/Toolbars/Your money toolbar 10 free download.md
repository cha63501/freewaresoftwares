The Your Money Toolbar offers a new and unique browsing experience for UK
consumers, helping them make the most of their money when surfing or shopping
online.

The toolbar is divided into five main categories; **Investments**, **Personal
Finance**, **Shopping**, **Travel** and **Online Betting**. Each of these
contains a number of drop down menus for subcategories that are organised by
product type and brand name, providing one-click access to the top information
sites, tools and retail brands. The Your Money UK team are continuously
researching the market for the latest deals and special promotions and
whenever they add new sites and resources, the toolbar updates automatically
in real time, ensuring that toolbar users always have access to the most up to
date information.

The toolbar also has some additional features that include:

  * A Google search box. 
  * Access to the RoboForm utility for storing passwords and filling out online forms quickly and securely. 
  * A number of RSS newsfeeds from the BBC, SkySports, the Financial Times and a number of consumer sites. 
  * Each user also has the option to customise their toolbar by adding or removing components to suit their own browsing preferences. 

The Your Money Toolbar is completely free to download and is guaranteed
spyware and adware free. The full privacy policy can be viewed
