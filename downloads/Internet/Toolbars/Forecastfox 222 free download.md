**Publisher's Description**  
  

Forecastfox is an extension that brings international weather from
AccuWeather.comA(r) to your Firefox web browser. You can use your US zip code
or you can easily find your town or city by using the built in search tool. It
is unobtrusive and lightweight, yet can be customized to display nearly as
much data as the leading desktop weather programs! If you canA't find what you
are looking for, click the weather icons displayed to open the
AccuWeather.comA(r) forecast for your location. A slider, similar to when
popup notification for when all downloads complete, pops up from the bottom
right corner of your screen when the current conditions are updated. You can
even set what appears in it or disable it!

Forecastfox lets you customize everything, from the number of days to be
forecasted, to the content of the tooltips. You can decide whether to see the
labels, and you can decide what toolbar to place Forecastfox in. The options
window is intuitive and makes it fast and easy to change any of the settings
youA'd like.

Works with: Firefox: 3.0 - 11.0a1
