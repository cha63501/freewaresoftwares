**Publisher's Description**  
  

Ceasys Toolbar allows you to communicate with other toolbar users at a point
of interest. What this means is that you will be able to converse on any web
page you visit by using our communication portal, located in the Ceasys
toolbar.

Using ceasys eliminates the need for you to register for multiple accounts
with each site you want to post on, and allows you to communicate privately
with friends or groups, in addition to publicly with all users. Being able to
converse on a one on one bases is a feature you will not find anywhere else,
and is what puts ceasys in a league of their own.

This download is for Internet Explorer.

Download the Firefox version from the [developerA's
website](http://ceasys.com).
