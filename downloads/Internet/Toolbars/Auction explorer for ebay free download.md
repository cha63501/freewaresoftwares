Auction Explorer is the first and only Internet Explorer Add-on for eBay. Now
you have access to the advanced eBay search features right from within
Internet Explorer while you are browsing eBay. Easily save and navigate
searches on your terms. You can even sync your eBay Watches and Bids with one
click access! The eBay Toolbar was not enough for me, I needed more details
when IA'm researching and bidding and Auction Explorer for eBay does that for
me.

  * Works right within Internet Explorer! One click access to the hidden search features on eBay. 
  * Auction Explorer will save you over 15 mouse clicks when trying to duplicate the searches on eBay!

  * Many search combinations available and the ability to save those searches for later use! 
  * Remembers your search preferences so you can quickly search eBay for your favorite items on your terms! 
  * Sync your eBay Watches and Bids right from within the add-on Bar none, this is the best add-on to Internet Explorer and eBay. 
  * This is better than the eBay Toolbar!
