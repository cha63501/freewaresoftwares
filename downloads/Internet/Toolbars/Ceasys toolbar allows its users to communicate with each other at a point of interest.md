**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ceasys Toolbar allows you to communicate with other toolbar users at a point of interest. What this means is that you will be able to converse on any web page you visit by using our communication portal, located in the Ceasys toolbar. 

Using ceasys eliminates the need for you to register for multiple accounts with each site you want to post on, and allows you to communicate privately with friends or groups, in addition to publicly with all users. Being able to converse on a one on one bases is a feature you will not find anywhere else, and is what puts ceasys in a league of their own.
