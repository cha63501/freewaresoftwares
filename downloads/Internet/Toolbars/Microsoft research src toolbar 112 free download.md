**Publisher's Description**  
  

Microsoft Research SRC Toolbar is a tool for searching web with the Search
Result Clustering (SRC) technique, which is developed at Web Search and Mining
Group in Microsoft Research, Asia. It on-the-fly clusters a certain search
engineA's search results into different groups, and provide meaningful and
readable names for these groups. SRC changes the traditional representation of
search results into a non-linear way, so as to facilitate userA's browsing.

Traditional clustering techniques donA't work for this problem because the
documents are short, the cluster names should be readable and the algorithm
should be efficient for on-the-fly calculation. This method takes the whole
problem in another way and overcome the difficulties in traditional clustering
method. Basically, it tries to first identify salient topics by identifying
distinct and independent keyword, and then classify the search results into
these topics.
