The Netcraft Toolbar uses NetcraftA's enormous databases of Web site
information to show you all the attributes of each site you visit on the Web,
including the sitesA' hosting location, country, longevity and popularity. It
also mobilizes the Netcraft community into a giant neighborhood watch scheme
to empower the most alert and experienced members to protect the vulnerable
against fraud and phishing attacks.
