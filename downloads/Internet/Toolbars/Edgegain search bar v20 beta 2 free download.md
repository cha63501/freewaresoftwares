**Publisher's Description**  
  

Search for MP3 songs, stock quotes, shareware and whatever you want.

Search the web directly from your Internet ExplorerA's toolbar with this new
version of EdgeGain. You can select from the top search engines, shareware
sites and online stores, and search by just typing your query on the toolbar
while browsing the Web. Searching Altavista, Amazon, Google, and dozens of
other portals is now easier and faster than ever.

Like earlier versions, EdgeGain 2.0 also compares prices for Books, CDs, DVDs,
software, hardware and games on the major online stores, helping you find the
best bargains on the web, but now you can search for the product you want
directly from the toolbar. It starts comparing prices immediately after you
reach the product page.
