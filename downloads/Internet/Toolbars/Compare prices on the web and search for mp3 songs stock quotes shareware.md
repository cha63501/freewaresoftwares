**Publisher's Description**  
  


Search for MP3 songs, stock quotes, shareware and whatever you want. 

Search the web directly from your Internet ExplorerA's toolbar with this new version of EdgeGain. You can select from the top search engines, shareware sites and online stores, and search by just typing your query on the toolbar while browsing the Web. Searching Altavista, Amazon, Google, and dozens of other portals is now easier and faster than ever.

Like earlier versions, EdgeGain 2.0 also compares prices for Books, CDs, DVDs, software, hardware and games on the major online stores, helping you find the best bargains on the web, but now you can search for the product you want directly from the toolbar. It starts comparing prices immediately after you reach the product page.
