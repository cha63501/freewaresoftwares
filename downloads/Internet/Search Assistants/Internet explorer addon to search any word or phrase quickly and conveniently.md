Ziptionary is a free tool for Internet Explorer that allows you to right-click on any word, phrase, or link and select "Search Web", "Search Encyclopedia", or "Search Dictionary". Once youA've right-clicked a word and selected your type of search, your results are displayed immediately. 

The Ziptionary bar gives you quick links to about a dozen different types of searches, all without ever having to type your search.

The concept behind Ziptionary is incredibly simple, but once youA've used it, youA'll wonder how you managed without it. 

Requires: Internet Explorer 5.0 or above.
