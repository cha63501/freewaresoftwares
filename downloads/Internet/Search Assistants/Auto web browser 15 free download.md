**Publisher's Description**  
  

Auto Web Browser saves a lot of time when you are looking for something on the
Internet. No need for numerous clicking, waiting for pages download and
closing annoying pop-ups. Just enter the words describing what you want to
find.

The Auto Web Browser will consult the search engines from a user defined list,
download the pages to your computer, filter and analyze them and then it will
automatically surf further, downloading other potentially interesting pages
using the links from the meaningful part of the relevant documents. Web
crawling reveals many interesting pages, that cannot be found easily if you
use search engines only. With good Internet connection hundreds of documents
could be processed in minutes. If you have slow Internet, just take a break
and wait for a while. After most of the routine job is done by the
application, the found pages and an annotated report are available for an
instant offline preview.

The application contains Download and Exclude lists of URLs, that can be saved
to and loaded from a file and filled by URLs from any file or clipboard. The
search engines used by the application are fully customisable and a user can
add the specific engines most suitable for the particular search task. The
tool can also be used in a simple mode just retrieving and filtering results
from search engines. The links to found documents with summaries and thumbnail
images of the pages can be placed into a structured report and saved in html
format.
