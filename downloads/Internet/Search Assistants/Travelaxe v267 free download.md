**Publisher's Description**  
  

Travelaxe is a hotel rate search engine that searches multiple travel websites
at that same time for hotel rates and lets you compare the prices from each
travel website side by side, highlighting the cheapest prices found for each
hotel. The amount you can save for each hotel is also displayed so you can see
the savings. When you find the price you want, Travelaxe takes you right to
the booking page at the cheapest travel website to complete your reservation.
Using Travelaxe can save you both time and money when looking for a hotel for
your next trip.

Travelaxe currently supports the following locations (with more being added
all the time):

  * Las Vegas 
  * Orlando 
  * New Orleans 
  * Lake Tahoe 
  * Reno 
  * Daytona Beach 
  * Ft. Lauderdale 
Some of the additional advantages of using Travelaxe include finding better
last minute rates, check in or out on any day of the week, no minimum number
of nights required, view hotelsA' websites and maps. There are also filters
that allow you to customize your selections based on price, hotel name or
class rating.
