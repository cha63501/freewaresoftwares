Web-based scientific research is a time consuming and inefficient process, eating up a researcherA's precious time; hours that could be spent conducting experiments and analyzing data. It involves searching public databases such as PubMed, NCBI Entrez, NextBio, and other information sites like Wikipedia. It also requires the equally time-consuming researching, shopping for, and buying many reagent, software and instrument products. The CL!Psci engine offers a new, more direct and efficient way to do web-based research using special right click functionality on your mouse that gets you to the right information much faster and with less effort. 

No More "Copy and Paste"  
Now, with a simple right click, the CL!Psci engine enables researchers to tie or clip together ainstantaneously at their fingertips without any typing or copy-pastinga both public and commercial scientific information from many sources, adding up to a huge time savings compared with visiting many sites for multiple search engines.

One click, Two Browsers  
A single right-click on a word or phrase executes two searches. User-set preferences determine whether the researcher sees public information search results or consolidated supplier catalog search results first in the open window, the other search results reside as a handy "there when you need it" icon in the task bar below.
