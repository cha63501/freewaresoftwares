Google-like software, designed to meet the specialized and intensive, web-

  * Customize a menu of your most commonly used scientific search engines

  * With one click, browse a consolidated supplier catalog to get to the right product faster than ever 
Web-based scientific research is a time consuming and inefficient process,
eating up a researcherA's precious time; hours that could be spent conducting
experiments and analyzing data. It involves searching public databases such as
PubMed, NCBI Entrez, NextBio, and other information sites like Wikipedia. It
also requires the equally time-consuming researching, shopping for, and buying
many reagent, software and instrument products. The CL!Psci engine offers a
new, more direct and efficient way to do web-based research using special
right click functionality on your mouse that gets you to the right information
much faster and with less effort.

No More "Copy and Paste"  
Now, with a simple right click, the CL!Psci engine enables researchers to tie
or clip together ainstantaneously at their fingertips without any typing or
copy-pastinga both public and commercial scientific information from many
sources, adding up to a huge time savings compared with visiting many sites
for multiple search engines.

One click, Two Browsers  
A single right-click on a word or phrase executes two searches. User-set
preferences determine whether the researcher sees public information search
results or consolidated supplier catalog search results first in the open
window, the other search results reside as a handy "there when you need it"
icon in the task bar below.
