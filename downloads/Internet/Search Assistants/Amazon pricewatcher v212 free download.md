**Publisher's Description**  
  

Amazon is known for its huge product catalog and information content on
products. Amazon PriceWatcher makes searching more comfortable by enabling
fast access to the amount of data of all Amazon stores (US, UK, Germany,
France, Canada and Japan) in one compact user interface. Here from you are
able to search in nearly all categories (Books, Popular Music, Classical
Music, DVDs, Software, Video Games, Electronics, Apparel, etc.).

You can add products into a library and with a single click Amazon
PriceWatcher will update prices of all items stored in that library. You can
set a target price for each item, so that Amazon PriceWatcher will inform you
if any price reaches or falls below this value by highlighting the affected
items in the library with different colors or by displaying notifications for
each item. The advantage is that you have an overview of all current prices at
Amazon and you can buy your favorite product as soon as its price falls below
an adequate price.
