**Publisher's Description**  
  


MID is a program that helps users to download image files from the internet. It was originally created to read Google search engine output and download images directly from source. Inevitably, things changed and MID stopped working. 

This is MID Revisited, a total rewrite and much improved version. It can now handle Bing and Yahoo image searches in addition to Google. 

MID is not a browser. A browser must be used to create a search and show the result page. MID uses the HTML from the result to extracts links to source image files so they can be downloaded directly from their location.

Having scanned the HTML and created a list of links, multiple threads running in parallel are used to download image files. The maximum number to be used can be specified, the optimum number depending on system resources. Most systems can handle between 20 and 30 threads.

This update rectifies a thread control problem and adds an option to paste browser source code directly into MID
