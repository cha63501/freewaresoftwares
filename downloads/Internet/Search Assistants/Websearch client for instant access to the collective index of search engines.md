**Publisher's Description**  
  


Qube - abbreviated as q3, is the next generation, websearch client for instant, single-click access to information from the collective index of traditional search engines. 

Qube emphasizes on usability rather than availability of information allowing you to search the web with a click, using a custom-defined mouse and keyboard combination (hotkey), without having to type the keyword manually, unlike the usual tradition.

Point you mouse on ANY (Browser, Messenger, Document, Email and almost any) text and press Ctrl + Right Mouse Button and youA've got the web results! If youA'd want to type the keyword manually, just single-click on the tray icon or press the PopBox hotkey - Alt + X (default), opening a compact PopBox to search near your mouse cursor. This still is quicker and convenient than normal browser-searching.

But donA't take our word for it, qube is available gratis - grab it and see for yourself!

There is still so much more that we havenA't even touched the surface of, but since qube is brand-spanking new, it isnA't yet feature complete. Qube needs your support, suggestions, ideas and some audible applause, that would help us improve this small & free tool more quickly & precisely.
