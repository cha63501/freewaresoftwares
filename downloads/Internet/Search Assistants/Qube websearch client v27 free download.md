**Publisher's Description**  
  

Qube - abbreviated as q3, is the next generation, websearch client for
instant, single-click access to information from the collective index of
traditional search engines.

Qube emphasizes on usability rather than availability of information allowing
you to search the web with a click, using a custom-defined mouse and keyboard
combination (hotkey), without having to type the keyword manually, unlike the
usual tradition.

Point you mouse on ANY (Browser, Messenger, Document, Email and almost any)
text and press Ctrl + Right Mouse Button and youA've got the web results! If
youA'd want to type the keyword manually, just single-click on the tray icon
or press the PopBox hotkey - Alt + X (default), opening a compact PopBox to
search near your mouse cursor. This still is quicker and convenient than
normal browser-searching.

But donA't take our word for it, qube is available gratis - grab it and see
for yourself!

There is still so much more that we havenA't even touched the surface of, but
since qube is brand-spanking new, it isnA't yet feature complete. Qube needs
your support, suggestions, ideas and some audible applause, that would help us
improve this small & free tool more quickly & precisely.
