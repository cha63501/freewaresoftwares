Travelaxe is a hotel rate search engine that searches multiple travel websites at that same time for hotel rates and lets you compare the prices from each travel website side by side, highlighting the cheapest prices found for each hotel. The amount you can save for each hotel is also displayed so you can see the savings. When you find the price you want, Travelaxe takes you right to the booking page at the cheapest travel website to complete your reservation.
