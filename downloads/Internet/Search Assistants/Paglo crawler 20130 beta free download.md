**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Paglo Open Source Crawler automatically discovers all of your IT data and
gives you the ability to search for answers to your computer, network, and
user questions. Think AGoogle for IT.A Once you download it and tell it to get
started, the Crawler automatically scans your network, devices, and other IT
assets, and captures their characteristics, giving you unprecedented search
and analytics capabilities. It allows you to return both simple text results
as well as rich quantitative data.

Once the Paglo Crawler has collected all the data it then securely delivers
your IT information to your Paglo Search Index - in a separate and
unassailable location that only you have access to - so you can search and
analyze your data through your Paglo Web account. And since the Paglo Crawler
is open source, you can extend it with to gather additional data through its
simple plug-in architecture.

The Crawler is installed on only one computer in your network, and does not
install itself on any other systems. It initially scans every system that it
detects and as it continues to run it listens passively for any new devices.
Whenever it discovers a new device, the Crawler immediately gathers rich data
about that device and adds it to your Search Index. The Crawler runs
continually but uses minimal network and system resources. It does not leave
any footprints on the machines that it scans and it can be re-configured to
scan your network at any time interval you set.

The Paglo Crawler enables you to search all of your IT data and identify and
solve your IT issues. In addition to its core search capabilities, you can
take any search result and generate rich dashboards to keep your fingers on
the pulse of your IT environment. You can also use a number of additional
applications that have been built on the Paglo platform and tap the wisdom of
the community through Paglo share-its which are saved searches, dashboards,
and alerts.
