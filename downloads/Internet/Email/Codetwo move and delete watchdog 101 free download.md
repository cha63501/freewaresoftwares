CodeTwo Move & Delete Watchdog protects you from accidental wrongdoing in
Outlook.

Outlook doesnA't prompt for any confirmation when you move or delete something
from the Outlook folder tree. This can cause you a lot of trouble, especially
when you unexpectedly drop a folder full of important data to an unknown
location.

CodeTwo Move & Delete Watchdog will warn you before you accidentally change a
folder location in Outlook or abruptly delete it.

**System Requirements:**

  * Microsoft Outlook 2010 / 2007 
  * Microsoft Windows 7 / Vista / XP (32-Bit/64-Bit)
