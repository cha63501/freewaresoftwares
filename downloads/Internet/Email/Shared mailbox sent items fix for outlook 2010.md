**Publisher's Description**  
  


ShareSentIt is designed to help Outlook 2010 users who use shared mailboxes in a corporate environment. If you are a regular user of shared mailboxes, you may already be aware that when an email is sent from a shared mailbox, the email goes straight into the Sent Items of the user that has sent the email rather than into the Sent Items of the shared mailbox itself. 

ShareSentIt fixes this problem and ensures that all sent email from a shared mailbox goes directly into the shared mailboxes sent items meaning that all other users of the shared mailbox can also see any emails that have been sent from it.
