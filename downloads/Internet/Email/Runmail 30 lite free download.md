**Publisher's Description**  
  

SolidRun RunMail takes command line parameters and send SMTP emails without an
external SMTP server. SMTP server is built-in and the program is less than
200K. All you need is a TCP/IP connection. **No MAPI, no CDO, no Outlook and
no Exchange.**

The product is designed mainly for developers/admins who want to send emails
in their applications/scripts but donA't bother programming MAPI, CDO or SMTP.
It also solves 3 other problems:

  1. Looking for/configuring an SMTP server (e.g. when your program targets home users). 
  2. Outlook security warning box may popup if one tries to access its API programmatically. 
  3. Sending emails in batch/script files - esp. useful for DBAs and Server/Network Admins. 
This free version does not support attachments.
