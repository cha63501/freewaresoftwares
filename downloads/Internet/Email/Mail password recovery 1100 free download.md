**Publisher's Description**  
  

Virtually all e-mail clients use password caching because itA's very
inconvenient to enter a password every time you get your mail. This means it
is very easy to find out a password. The universal solution lies in POP3
server imitation. E-mail clients will reveal the password during the
transaction. MPR uses this method to recover lost passwords.

MPR does NOT recover passwords to Web-based email accounts (such as hotmail,
yahoo, usa.net, etc.)

MPR is intended to recover YOUR passwords only. It just extracts passwords
stored on your computer. It is not a hackerA's tool, MPR does not allow to
crack somebody elseA's password (in most cases it is illegal).

This download is the executable only. You might need some VB support files
