**Publisher's Description**  
  


Free ELPI2 is a program for electronic signing of e-mails which encapsulates the files to the S/MIME format or to the compressed ZEP(ZIP) format of the CMS AdES (Advanced Electronic Signatures). The formats like ZEP(ZIP) are defined in standards for electronic signature by the National Security Authority on the page: 

<http://www.nbusr.sk/en/electronic-signature/approved-formats/index.html>

This program can be used for creation of AdES based on qualified certificates which are used mainly in the Czech Republic like (ZEP), where the electronic signing of e-mails is frequently used.

**Supports:**

  * Hash algorithms: **SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD160**.  

  * Signature algorithms: **RSA 1024 - 4096, DSA,** (and **ECDSA** in final version) 

The private key is stored on: 

  1. Smart cards or USB tokens where the interface is through PKCS#11;
  2. soft token PKCS#15; 
  3. or MS crypto API.

The main advantage of ELPI is the simplicity of the usage. This advantage is because ELPI does not need to be installed and you can use it directly from any device like USB, CD-ROM or hard disk.

**Program Requires:** Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP ...

**Hint:** If you do not use the program ELPI with the smart card PKCS#11, but with the soft token PKCS#15, then store your private key in the soft token on the USB "disk" or CD. In this case you will be able to create the signature easier and the copy of your private key will never be present on the foreign computer. Thanks to design of ELPI it does not need to be installed and can be running directly from any media like CD or USB disk.
