**Publisher's Description**  
  


Send and collect all the emails for your home or office network, whilst saving dial up time. 

The mailserver is designed to collect all your emails in one dial up connection. This will save your on-line time and telephone charges for not having each individual email client on your network collecting their own email. You can now collect all emails from multiple POP servers.

The mail server will work as a standalone server on a shared PC or as a network mailserver. Now there is no longer a need for each user to dial up to collect their email.

This mail server is a fully featured SMTP and POP3 server with unlimited connections or accounts, with ease of use being a priority. It has a scheduled send and receive, with a program override to allow outgoing email to be sent immediately and manual override from the mailbox tray icon.
