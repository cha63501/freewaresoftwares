new three-column view. Customize your toolbar, change its look with themes,
and use Mail Views to quickly sort through your e-mail.

Thunderbird provides enterprise and government grade security features such as
S/MIME, digital signing, message encryption, support for certificates and
security devices.  
  
** Packed with Features **  
Thunderbird gives you IMAP/POP support, support for HTML mail, labels, quick
search, smart addressbook, return receipts, advanced message filtering, LDAP
address completion, import tools, powerful search, and the ability to manage
multiple e-mail and newsgroup accounts.  
  
** Unlimited Features **  
Thunderbird lets you add additional features as you need them through
extensions. Extensions are a powerful tool to help you build a mail client
that meets your specific needs.
