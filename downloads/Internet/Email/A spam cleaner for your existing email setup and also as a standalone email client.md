**Publisher's Description**  
  


yMail can be used as a spam cleaner for your existing email setup, and also as a standalone email client. 

yMailA's spam filters use Bayesian techniques. You can show yMail which messages are spam and which are not (before you even download them to your computer!) and each time will adjust its filters to suit. After a few days, it will be able to sort mail quickly and efficiently without any input.

**What's New in version 1.0.293:**

  * Added a spell checker during mail composing + many little fixes and changes
