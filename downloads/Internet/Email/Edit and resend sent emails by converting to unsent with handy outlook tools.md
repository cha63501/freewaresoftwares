Have you ever proudly composed a lengthy email in Outlook only to be disappointed to find it returned to your mailbox after youA've sent it? It may be because you addressed it wrongly or made a mistake in the typing. In many cases youA'll find characters all over the returned email which make it look second hand. YouA'll soon discover that the email is now "Read Only" which means you canA't edit it, and itA's not just a matter of resending it if you want it to keep its original appearance. Even if you copy and paste into a new form, youA'll find unwanted characters everywhere.

There is an easy way to convert a SENT email to an UNSENT one, allowing you to edit it and send it just like new. Did you know that just a single line inside the email tells Outlook whether the email has already been sent or not? If you add "X-Unsent: 1" to the correct place in a sent email it will magically revert to an unsent one. Magically revert SENT to UNSENT emails with these Handy Outlook Tools.
