YPOPs! (formerly YahooPOPs!) is an open-source initiative to provide free POP3
access to your Yahoo! Mail account. It emulates a POP3 server and enables
popular email clients like Outlook, Netscape, Eudora, Mozilla, etc. to
download email from Yahoo! accounts. It provides a POP3 server interface at
one end to talk to email clients and an HTTP client (browser) interface at the
other which allows it to talk to Yahoo.
