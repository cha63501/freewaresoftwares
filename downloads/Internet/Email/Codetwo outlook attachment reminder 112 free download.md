CodeTwo Outlook Attachment Reminder is a free add-on that can be useful for
every user of Microsoft Outlook.

The program scans a content of your e-mail and if it finds expressions, such
as e.g. A'enclosedA' or A'attachmentA', it recognizes the message as the one
that should include a file.

The application alerts you when you are about to send such message without
appropriate files attached. Owing to this, you can avoid stressful situations.
