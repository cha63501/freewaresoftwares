**Publisher's Description**  
  


PopMan is a POP3 manager and notifier. It can be used to list all e-mails received on your incoming mail server (POP3 server), without having to load these mails completely. Unwanted e-mails can be deleted directly from the server. 

You can use PopMan to check your e-mail accounts in the background. When new e-mails arrive, you will be notified.

To show you whether e-mails contain useful information, or whether they are just spam, PopMan provides a preview functionality. You can use this preview pane to read the text-based content of your e-mails A whether they are plain text or HTML.

In contrast to most e-mail programs, reading mail with PopMan is absolutely secure. There is no threat of executing dangerous code or being infected with viruses.

You can direct PopMan to use local storage (settings are saved to an *.ini file), and save it to a floppy disk or USB memory stick. This means you can check your mail on any computer with internet access.
