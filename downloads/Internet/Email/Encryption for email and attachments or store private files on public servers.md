**Publisher's Description**  
  


Encryption for email and attachments, or store private files on public servers. 

PackMan (Package Manager) stores files within itA's own compressed and ciphered file format. Built in RTF common word processing format. Use of the built in Contact Manager is optional, and when enabled it will auto-supply password for you so you do not need to remember a seperate password for each contact, especially useful when used with email contacts because it has a seamless integration with Outlook and other windows email clients, just click the attachment and you will know for certain who it is from, and you know for certain nobody else saw the information in transit. 

It supports drag and drop Windows Shell integration similiar to WinZip, and is especially fast for what it does. Full 128 bit encryption, and compression for all data and documents stored in the package. The file format has a public interface available through ActiveX or a DLL and comes with examples to auto-generate PackMan compatible files from Visual Basic and other programming languages. Packman supports 64 bit file storage, unlike the cramped 32 bit limits of Winzip it holds more files, and packages may be very large. Packman file storage supports versioning, so that the same file from the same location may be added multiple times as the contents of that file change over time. 

The best part is that PackMan is 100% free, it never nags you to pay for it, it never expires, and there are no advertisements in it.
