**Publisher's Description**  
  


Microsoft Outlook is a great program, and is often kept open constantly. It is missing a very important feature, however. It cannot be minimized to the system tray. HideOutlook gives it this capability, meaning you can keep Outlook open, but out of your way. It still informs you of new email and any reminders you have set, while only showing a little icon in the system tray.
