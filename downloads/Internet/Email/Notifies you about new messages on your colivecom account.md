**Publisher's Description**  
  


Corlive Notifier is an application which alerts you when you have new messages on your Corlive.com account. 

It displays an icon in the system tray to let you know if you have unread messages in your Corlive.com box, without the need to open a web browser. 

Corlive.com is your alternative to obsolete e-mail. Only humans can send messages via your contact at Corlive.com, and so you will probably never find SPAM in your Inbox. On the other hand, no legitimate e-mails sent to the Corlive.com account will ever be filtered out by any SPAM filters, because there are no SPAM filters - they are not necessary.
