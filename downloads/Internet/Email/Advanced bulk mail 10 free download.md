Advanced Bulk Mail Plus is a powerful bulk emailing program and it has a built
in Mail server (SMTP server) so you cant send your Bulk mail directly from
your own PC, you can also use an external mail Server if you choose to.

Fast delivery  
Advanced Bulk Mail Plus has its own built-in SMTP server. This allows you to
bypass your ISPA's server and deliver messages directly to the recipientsA'
inboxes. It also uses multi-threading, which means you can send mail using
multiple connections at the same time.

Secured delivery  
Advanced Bulk Mail Plus delivers email without using any other servers. That
means the message is not logged or stored on any servers other than the
receiving one and is available only to the recipient.
