**Publisher's Description**  
  

Outlook Express is a great program, and is often kept open constantly. It is
missing a very important feature, however. It cannot be minimized to the
system tray. HideOE gives it this capability, meaning you can keep Outlook
Express open, but out of your way. It still informs you of new email and any
reminders you have set, while only showing a little icon in the system tray.
