CodeTwo Active Directory Photos is designed to let you easily upload usersA' photographs to Active Directory, manage the and edit according to your needs. Even hundreds of employeesA' photos can be auto-adjusted and uploaded to Active DirectoryA's thumbnailPhoto property. Owing to this free application, bulk photo changes and Active Directory photo uploads can be done with a few clicks and they do not require using Import-RecipientDataProperty cmdlet command any more. The user interface of CodeTwo Active Directory is clear and logical. 

In large organizations, photographs added to internal e-mails may be the best way to let employees recognize each other and to make their conversation more tangible and natural. CodeTwo Active Directory enables to add pictures to internal Outlook 2010 messages and display them in GAL (Global Address List) and contacts. Photographs can also be included in external messagesA' signatures to allow clients to see who they are corresponding with. It may be a good idea then to create a unified, beautiful e-mail signature template for all employees. It would display appropriate photographs ascribed to every staff member. 

Adding photos to multiple e-mail signatures is simple if you insert Active Directory (AD) placeholders to your e-mail template. This feature imports data from AD and automatically supplies the signatures with a suitable content - employeesA' photos in this case. You can activate this function using CodeTwo Exchange Rules Pro. It includes a user-friendly template editor, containing a wide list of applicable AD Dynamic Fields. Both CodeTwo Active Directory Photos and a trial version of CodeTwo Exchange Rules Pro can be downloaded from CodeTwoA's website for free.
