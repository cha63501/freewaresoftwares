**Publisher's Description**  
  

Emailing files as attachments, particularly large files or files that are
possible virus containers, can be very frustrating. You can never be sure if
the recipientA's server has rejected the mail until you get back that annoying
message telling you the mail was not delivered! Or not!

There are sites which provide a service to get around this problem, normally
for a fee. Now you can easily do it yourself from your desktop for FREE.
FTPMailzipper will zip your files (with a password if required), zoom them up
using FTP and open your email client with an email message containing the
download link ready to for you to send to as many recipients as you want.

If you have FTP access as part of your contract, (most users do but there is
lots of free space if you donA't ) use it to temporarily hold your files. Let
your recipient decide when to download files. DonA't flood their mailbox with
large attachments. DonA't risk a A'non-deliveryA' because their server
doesnA't like your files. If you distribute files, make them available to
multiple recipients.

FTPMailzipper is a unique tool that fuses email and FTP to provide an improved
experience.
