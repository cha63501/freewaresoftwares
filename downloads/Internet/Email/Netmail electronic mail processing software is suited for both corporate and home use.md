**Publisher's Description**  
  


Netmail electronic mail processing software is suited for both corporate and home use. NetMail provides extensive filtering capabilities for incoming correspondence, creating incoming and outgoing message archives. 

Netmail can store information on many e-mail accounts. If you have several external mailboxes at different ISPs you will not need to enter a new password and adjust the settings every time. All you have to do is choose the connection profile through which you want to exchange messages. You can also create different mailboxes for different messages within the program.

NetMail allows automatic sorting of incoming messages based on preset criteria and their placement in individual folders or mailboxes where they can be viewed at a later time. In such a system only those folders can be viewed, for example, where the most important messages are directed.

The mail filter processes incoming messages based on header fields, for example, using the senderA's address or the content of the Subject field. Advanced filters can be applied both to any field of the message header or the body of the message itself.

Options are also provided for standard e-mail clients: support of attachments, message sorting by date, subject, address or other fields, message searches based on key words, etc.

The software will be useful for both electronic business professionals and all those who can set up a message exchange with existing customers and potential clients on a professional level.

  * New program interface and functionalities. 
  * SMTP authentication 
  * Check several accounts
