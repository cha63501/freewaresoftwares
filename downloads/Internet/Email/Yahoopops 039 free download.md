**Publisher's Description**  
  

**From the author:** Yahoo! Mail disabled free access to its POP3 service in April 2002. This resulted in many people (including myself) to look for alternative free POP3 services. But this exercise can be very difficult because of the fact that your Yahoo! Mail address could be with several people and informing all of them about your new email address could prove to be a nightmare. 

And then one day, I stumbled across a Perl script called FetchYahoo, which
almost did what I wanted! It downloaded emails from YahooA's website and
presented them in a format such that email clients like Netscape and Pine
could read them. But, the format in which it saved the emails is not supported
by all email clients, including the one that I use. Also, making a layman
install Perl and to get a Perl script to work could be a nightmare.

So, YahooPOPs! was born. YahooPOPs! is an open-source initiative to provide
free POP3 access to your Yahoo! Mail account. YahooPOPs! is available on the
Windows and Unix platforms.

This application emulates a POP3 server and enables popular email clients like
Outlook, Netscape, Eudora, Mozilla, Calypso, etc., to download email from
Yahoo! accounts.

How do we do it you ask? Well, this application is more like a gateway. It
provides a POP3 server interface at one end to talk to email clients and an
HTTP client (browser) interface at the other which allows it to talk to Yahoo!
