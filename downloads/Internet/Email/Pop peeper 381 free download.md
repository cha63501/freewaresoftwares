POP Peeper is an email notifier that runs in your Windows task bar and alerts
you when you have new email on any of your POP3, Hotmail, MSN, Yahoo,
Mail.com, MyWay, Excite, Lycos.com, or RediffMail accounts.

You can also use POP Peeper to read and delete your email. POP Peeper supports
HTML email, so you can see your email the same way as you would in your email
client. Several options are available that will decrease or eliminate the
risks of reading your email (viruses, javascript, webbugs, etc).

If you share your computer, you can password-protect your accounts or
password-protect access to POP Peeper. Using POP Peeper, you can quickly scan
what messages are important enough to read, and which ones you want to delete

others, however if mail notification is your main reason, than this is a great
little tool that works fast and efficient.
