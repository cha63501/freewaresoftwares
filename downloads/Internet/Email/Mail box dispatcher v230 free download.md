Mail Box Dispatcher allows you to control incoming email messages on the
server side. You can delete unwanted messages from your mailboxes without

download a few lines of message also (you choose number of lines to preview).

  * You can launch e-mail client directly from Mail Box Dispatcher. 
  * Built-in auto-selection rules let you setup Mail Box Dispatcher to auto-select unwanted messages. Five different types of rules: Sender, Recipient, Subject, Body, Friends and fast adding of new rules transform this tool to powerful anti-spam weapon.
