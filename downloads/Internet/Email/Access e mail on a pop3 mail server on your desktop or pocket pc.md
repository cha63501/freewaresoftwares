**Publisher's Description**  
  


This software allows you to access e-mail on a POP3 mail server on your Desktop PC or Pocket PC. It provides the function of common remote e-mail access. 

The mail displayed by nPOP is only the mail present on the server. Therefore, if mail is deleted from your server it will disappear from a list, even if the mail is displayed in the list.

When you connect using nPOP, the mail is listed and you can see the header only. From that list you can select e-mail you want to receive on your Pocket PC or PC. This is more efficient than downloading all the e-mail on your Pocket PC or PC. 

It can be used for management of the mail on a server as a method to check for the arrival of new e-mail. It is convenient, for people that switch machines often since you can put your information on one floppy disk where all the processing can be performed.
