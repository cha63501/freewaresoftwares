**Publisher's Description**  
  

Each time that you send a new message in Outlook, the emails that you type in
To/Cc fields, are automatically inserted into the AutoComplete list, so in the
next time that you type an email address, Outlook automatically completes the
right email address for you.

The AutoComplete file of Outlook is stored under [Your Profile]\Application
Data\Microsoft\Outlook , and it always saved as the profile name of Outlook
with .NK2 extension.

This utility reads the AutoComplete file of Outlook (with .NK2 extension),
displays all email records stored in it, and allows you to easily export these
records into text/html/xml file.

**What's New in version 1.43:**

  * Added support for Outlook 2010 Beta - Automtically locate the Stream_Autocomplete*.dat files under [Local AppData]MicrosoftOutlookRoamCache.
