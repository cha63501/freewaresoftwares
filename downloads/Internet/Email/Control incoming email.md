Mail Box Dispatcher allows you to control incoming email messages on the server side. You can delete unwanted messages from your mailboxes without downloading them. Mail Box Dispatcher downloads only information about the message (From, To, Subject and Size) and only about new messages. It can download a few lines of message also (you choose number of lines to preview).
