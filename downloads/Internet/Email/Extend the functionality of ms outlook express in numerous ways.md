**Publisher's Description**  
  


OE-QuoteFix will extend the functionality of MS Outlook Express in numerous ways. Its main purpose is to modify message composition windows on-the-fly (no user interaction is necessary) to allow for correct quoting and to change the appearance of your plain-text replies and forwards in general: move your signature, use compressed indentation, have RFC compliant signatures, etc. 

The second feature is equally practical: OE-QuoteFix can instantly color quoted passages (according to the level of indentation), fix bad quoting and generally beautify messages using smilies and text effects as you view them in Outlook Express.
