**Publisher's Description**  
  


This innovative freeware application enhances any desktop mail system (Outlook, Netscape, Lotus, etc.) with the ability to record, send and answer voice-mails. Many messages, particularly short ones, are now easier to complete. Dictating messages is up to ten times faster than typing. 

The DictaMail features a specialized professional multimedia kernel. In addition to ease of use, it also ensures digital voice quality. The multimedia kernel compresses the recording automatically using the Windows-standard GSM format, reducing the file to 1/10th of itA's original size. 

You can use virtually any PC-compatible microphone with the DictaMail. The developers recommend USB devices that support Plug & Play, e.g. a Telex USB Headset. Many professionals prefer the handy Philips SpeechMike Pro USB or SpeechMike Classic USB for enhanced dictation ergonomics. 

DictaMail is compatible with Microsoft Windows 98 SE, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. DictaMail requires a minimum of 450 MHz processor speed and a minimum of 64MB RAM. More information on supported dictation hardware is available at http://www.dictanet.com. 

DictaMail includes free e-mail support and an ongoing upgrade-service to ensure professional-grade availability.
