**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tablane is a tabbed browser with key original and useful new features:

**Features:**

  * Multi-Search - Most big browsers are tied in to a particular search engine. WeA're completely independent and intend to stay that way. Through Tablane you can compare search engines for speeds, quality of results and advertising links. Customize your selection of search engines and share these with others. 
  * Lanes - Lanes let you see pages, prices or images on diverse sites all at once within a single window. No more opening up new browser windows, cluttering up your screen, when you want to see two or more pages side by side. Lanes make really good use of widescreen laptops. 
  * Collections - With TablaneA's bookmark Collections, you can easily edit and share links to Internet resources, or add them directly into your blogs complete with thumbnail snapshots of the sites youA've selected. Collections are in the RSS XML format. 
  * AutoRefresh - Have you ever wanted to keep your eye on a number of eBay auctions at once? Just right click on a Tab, and you can have the page refresh every few seconds if you wish. This is particularly useful when combined with our Lanes feature; you can see an auction and your sniping site automatically refreshing side by side as you count down to the deadline. 
  * Tabs - Many of us are familiar with tabbed browsing now. Tabs allow a number of pages to be kept readily available, even if the page is not visible in the browser. With Tablane, the tabs can be arranged in different places around the browser window not just across the top, which is great if you have a lot of tabs open at once.
