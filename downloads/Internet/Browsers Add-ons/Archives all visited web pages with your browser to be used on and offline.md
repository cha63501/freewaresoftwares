**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Offline Browser is a personal proxy server sitting behind your regular browser (Firefox, IE, Safari, Opera - whatever!), silently and speedily handling all the network traffic. Unlike most offline browsers with this concept, you donA't have to specifically tell WebAssistant to capture a website - it remembers everything you see, automatically adding new pages to the cache. WebAssistant updates your cached pages (in the background) so youA've always got the latest version to hand. ThereA's no difference between surfing the web and surfing your archive; you can even use you bookmarks or search your pages offline when you donA't have a network connection.   
  
**Your Benefits:**  
Work offline (train, plane, beach - wherever you like) without worrying that you have the info you need. Reduces the pressure of knowing what to save, and the necessity for repeating browsing sessions looking for something that was missed.   
Incorporate the web into presentations or talks where you donA't have internet access. You can sure youA'll always have the page you need with WebAssistant.   
Mobile users have the flexibility of accessing information from the web without having to worry about expensive access points. Shun overpriced wifi access ports - or at least only pay for what you really need.   
  
**Important Features:**

  * Automatically archive all pages visited. 
  * Accelerates in the web online browsing or updates the archive. 
  * No difference between on- and offline browsing. 
  * Links to resources of cache archives are marked for quick navigation.

  * Browse and interactive navigation in the original hierarchy of downloaded pages. 
  * Burn a site (or many sites) to CD for backup or archive. 
  * Supports the protocols HTTP and FTP.
  
Supplied with a detailed manual, a simple and completely comprehensive installation and deinstallation.   
  
The reader is an ideal addition to every browser!
