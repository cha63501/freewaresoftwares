**Publisher's Description**  
  


ChromeCacheView is a small utility that reads the cache folder of Google Chrome Web browser, and displays the list of all files currently stored in the cache. For each cache file, the following information is displayed: URL, Content type, File size, Last accessed time, Expiration time, Server name, Server response, and more. 

You can easily select one or more items from the cache list, and then extract the files to another folder, or copy the URLs list to the clipboard.

The cache folder of Google Chrome is located under [User Profile]\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache

**WhatA's New in version 1.56:**

  * Fixed bug: ChromeCacheView failed to copy the cache files if 'Save the files in the directory structure of the Web site' option was turned on and the Web site used non-standard TCP port (Instead of port 80). 
  * Fixed to display date/time values according to daylight saving time settings.
