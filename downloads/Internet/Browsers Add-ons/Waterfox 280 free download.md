**Publisher's Description**  
  

Waterfox is a high performance browser based on the Mozilla Firefox source
code. Made specifically for 64-Bit systems, Waterfox has one thing in mind:
speed.

The Firefox source code is taken and compiled to run specifically for 64-Bit
Windows computers. To make Waterfox stand out a bit more, itAs compiled with
optimizations so that it will run more efficiently and faster than just
compiling Firefox as a 64-Bit program.
