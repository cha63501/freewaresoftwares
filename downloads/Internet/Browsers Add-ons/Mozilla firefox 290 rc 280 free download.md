**Publisher's Description**  
  

Mozilla Firefox is a fast, full-featured browser for Windows that makes
browsing more efficient than ever before. Firefox includes pop-up blocking; a
tab-browsing mode that lets you open several pages in a single window;
integrated Google searching; simplified privacy controls that let you cover
your tracks more effectively; a streamlined browser window that shows you more
of the page than any other browser; and a number of additional features that
work with you to help you get the most out of your time online.

**Additional features include:**

  * Live Bookmarks - RSS integration lets you read the latest news headlines and read updates to your favorite sites that are syndicated. 
  * Extensions - Small add-ons that add new functionality to your Mozilla program. 
  * Themes - Allows you to change the way your Mozilla program looks with new graphics and colors. 
  * Privacy and Security - Built with your security in mind, Firefox keeps your computer safe from malicious spyware by not loading harmful ActiveX controls. 
  * Plugins - Programs that allow websites to provide content to you and have it appear in your browser. 
Firefox also comes with a standard set of developer tools including a powerful
JavaScript and CSS error/warning console, and an optional Document Inspector
that gives detailed insight about your pages.
