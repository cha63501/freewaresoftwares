**Publisher's Description**  
  

Net Viewer Lite is a Web Browser that allows you to load and View Web Sites in
Multiple Windows. You have the option to Browse using one window or view Web
Pages with additional Windows. Favorite Web sites are compatible with Internet
Explorer. Favorites Added or Deleted with Net Viewer Lite will be the seen
with Internet Explorer, and vice versa.

You can create multiple Lists of Web Site Pages that can be loaded and viewed
moving Forward or Backward through the list. Up to 25 Toolbar buttons can be
assigned Web Site Pages, so clicking the button will take you to that Web
Page. Up to 20 Function Keys with the use of the Shift Key are available to
assign Web Site Pages, so pressing the Function Key will take you to that Web
Page.

Additionally, an E-Mail window is provided to Send and Receive E-Mail. File
attachments are easily added to a message, compressed using A'ZipA' File
Format. Received messages with A'ZipA' File attachments are easily extracted
and can be viewed using the OLE assigned program.  
Like all Accessory Software programs, you can set the window and window
component colors. Program Option Settings are also a part of Net Viewer Lite.
