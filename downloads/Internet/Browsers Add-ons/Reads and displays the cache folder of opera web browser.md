OperaCacheView is a small utility that reads the cache folder of Opera Web browser, and displays the list of all files currently stored in the cache. For each cache file, the following information is displayed: URL, Content type, File size, Last accessed time, and last modified time in the server. 

You can easily select one or more items from the cache list, and then extract the files to another folder, or copy the URLs list to the clipboard.

**System Requirements:**

This utility works on any version of Windows, From Windows 98 to Windows Vista. However, for Windows 98/ME, you have to download the [non-Unicode version](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/operacacheview-98.zip).

You can use this utility even if Opera Web browser is not installed on your system, as long as you have the entire cache folder that you want to inspect. 

**What's New in version 1.40:**

  * OperaCacheView now also reads the turbo subfolder located under the main cache folder.
