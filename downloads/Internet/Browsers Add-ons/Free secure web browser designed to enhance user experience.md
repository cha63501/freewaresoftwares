360 Browser is an intuitive and free Web browser that lets users get what they want faster and in a more secure environment. The latest version adds special features that enhance user experience. 

**Features:**

  * Dual engine: 360 Browser is powered by both IE and Webkit engines to provide the best Web experience 
  * Ad Filter: lets users focus on what they want without getting distracted with unwanted advertisements 
  * Video Pop-out: allows users to place videos in separate windows that stay always on top 
  * Secure Browsing: the browser includes tools that filter phishing and other malicious websites 

**Using 360 Browser**

Since the installer was more than 40 MB, we expected it to take some time to install 360 Browser. Once we had clicked on the AInstallA button, however, the process took less than expected. The browser allowed us to customize it during its initial launch, including importing bookmarks from other browsers or an HTML file. We could also import data and settings from other browsers.

The graphic user interface is attractive, and it displays the thumbnails of the frequently visited pages whenever a user opens a new tab. All it takes to access one of the pages is to click on its thumbnail.

With its dual engine, the browser allowed us to choose between IE and Webkit modes depending on the websites we visited. However, you can also let the browser select the appropriate engine automatically if you are not sure or do not want to bother with the selection.

The use of mouse gestures made it easy to control the browser. We just needed to click and hold the left button, right button or the middle wheel and draw a gesture to perform a given action. Mouse gesture tips are enabled by default to guide users, but you can turn them off.

Popup ads are very common nowadays, but they mostly distract users with things they are not even interested in. The integrated ad blocker hides such advertisements, allowing you to focus on the content of the page you open. You no longer need to install third-party extensions to block unwanted advertisements.

When we visited a Web page with a video, the browser displayed a APop-outA message just above the video. Clicking on the message displayed the video in a pop up window that always stayed on top. We were able to move the window to any position on the monitor, and we could watch it irrespective of the program we were using.

The browser also provides a secure environment, thanks to its anti-phishing function. It blocks any phishing attempts it detects and filters malicious links. It displays a warning message whenever you try to access such a site.

**Conclusion**

360 Browser is a powerful and free Web browser that gives you peace of mind because it already includes features that make your browsing comfortable and safe.
