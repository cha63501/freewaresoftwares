**Publisher's Description**  
  


Expand your kids online experience with KidZui, the Internet for Kids. KidZui is a FREE graphical web browser designed just for kids with access to over a million kid-friendly websites, pictures, and videos. 

Real parents and teachers review content for KidZui so your kids can surf independently. Kids build avatars to express themselves online. They earn points for exploration and discovery. They can tag content and share it with parent-approved friends. Parents receive weekly emails and online reports to keep them in touch with their kidsA' online activities. 

Running KidZui in protected mode blocks access to all other applications and content on a computer to anyone who doesnA't have the parent password. Once a computer is secured, it will automatically re-launch back into protected mode even if it is restarted or the power is cycled. This is a great way to let your kids independently explore on KidZui without worrying about them using the adult Internet, or accidentally deleting important files.
