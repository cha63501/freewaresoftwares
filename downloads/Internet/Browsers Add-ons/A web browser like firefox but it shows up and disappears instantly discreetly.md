**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ghostzilla is a Web browser like Firefox, but it shows up and disappears instantly, discreetly, blended with your application -- any application -- so the Web pages look like part of it and not like the Web at all. (Read here how.) 

What would you use it for?

  * Hide from your boss and coworkers. Not a good idea: you can get fired (the network administrator sees everything you do) or end up wasting lots of time instead of dealing with what bothers you. 
  * Survive endless meetings (if you have a laptop; kind of like (1) but a little better). 
  * Have a browser instantly available and dismissable within your work application, washed out from ads and unnecessary pictures. This sounds useful -- except it will help you develop that attention deficit disorder. Seriously. 

So whatA's it for then?

  * Entertainment. Ghostzilla is a form of computer art.
