**Publisher's Description**  
  


HandyFind is a faster, friendlier way to find words in documents and web pages. It finds the words as you type so you will find what you are looking for as soon as you have entered enough letters. There are no windows to close or get in your way. 

HandyFind works in Internet Explorer, Microsoft Word, Notepad, Outlook Emails, and more. A small balloon displays the letters you have entered. The balloon turns gray if the text cannot be found; it turns pale if you are looking at an occurrence you have already found before.

With HandyFind, you can also highlight a word in a document and press a key to instantly find the next occurrence of that word. In Internet Explorer, if your search lands on a link, you can "click" the link by pressing the Enter key.
