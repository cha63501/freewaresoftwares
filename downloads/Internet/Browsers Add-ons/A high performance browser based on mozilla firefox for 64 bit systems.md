Waterfox is a high performance browser based on the Mozilla Firefox source code. Made specifically for 64-Bit systems, Waterfox has one thing in mind: speed. 

The Firefox source code is taken and compiled to run specifically for 64-Bit Windows computers. To make Waterfox stand out a bit more, itAs compiled with optimizations so that it will run more efficiently and faster than just compiling Firefox as a 64-Bit program.
