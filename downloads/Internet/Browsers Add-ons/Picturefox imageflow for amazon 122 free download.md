**Publisher's Description**  
  

PictureFox inserts an imageflow gallery to any Amazon product. It scans for
all available pictures and puts them into one gallery.

**Key benefits over standard Amazon gallery:**

  1. High resolution pictures: no more "Zoom-Viewer" with ridiculous small viewing window. View high definition pictures (up to 6 Mega-Pixels) on many products without viewing restrictions!
  2. All customer pictures in one fast gallery. No endless click-throughs!
  3. Different colors, versions and the marketplace: PictureFox has them all!
  4. Fast, easy to use, sleek ImageFlow style!
PictureFox works on all Amazon shops (.com, .de, .co.uk, ca., co.jp, .fr). It
shortens all Amazon links to a `www.amazon.com/dp/ASIN/` form for easier
linking.

The standard Amazon gallery is not changed, so still usable. PictureFox just
adds a small play-icon to launch the ImageFlow gallery.

Works with Firefox 3.5 or higher.
