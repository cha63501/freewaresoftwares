**Publisher's Description**  
  

Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 continues the Internet Explorer commitment to
provide enhanced security and privacy, additional browser features, and
enhanced usability for platform developers.

**New Features:**

  * **Tabbed Browsing** \- View multiple sites in a single browser window. Easily switch from one site to another through tabs at the top of the browser frame. 
  * **Instant RSS Feeds** \- Read RSS feeds directly in the browser, scan for important stories, and filter your view with search terms or site-specific categories. 
  * **New Streamlined User Interface** \- The Internet Explorer 7 frame is reorganized to make it noticeably simpler, more streamlined, and less cluttered with unnecessary items. 
  * **Phishing Filter** \- Proactively warns and helps protect you against potential or known fraudulent sites and blocks the site if appropriate. 
  * **Tab Groups** \- Tabs can be grouped and saved into logical categories, allowing you to open multiple tabs with a single click. A Tab Group can easily be set as the Home Page Group so the entire Tab Group opens every time Internet Explorer is launched from the Start menu. 
  * **CSS Improvements** \- Addresses many of the major inconsistencies that can cause web developers problems when producing visually rich, interactive webpages. 
  * **Toolbar Search Box** \- Web searches using your favorite search provider can now be entered into a search box within the toolbar, eliminating the clutter of separate toolbars. 
  * **Favorites Center** \- Offers easy and fast access to Favorites, Tab Groups, Browsing History, and RSS Feed subscriptions. 
  * **Dynamic Security Protection** \- Enhances awareness of website security and privacy settings by displaying color-coded notifications next to the address bar. 
  * **Quick Tabs** \- Provides easy tab selection and navigation by displaying thumbnails of all open tabs in a single window.
