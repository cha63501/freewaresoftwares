**Publisher's Description**  
  

IE Tab is a Firefox extension that embeds Internet Explorer in tabs of
Mozilla/Firefox. This is a great tool for web developers, since you can easily
see how your webpage is displayed in IE with just one click and then switch
back to Firefox.

This extension is derived from the famous extension IE View, but they are
quite different. While IE View always open IE-only pages in newly launched
windows of Internet Explorer, IE Tab can open them in tabs of Mozilla/Firefox.
