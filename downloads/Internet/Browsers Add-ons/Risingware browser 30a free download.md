Risingware Browser, a multi-process web browser based on IE, is fairly light
and fast in terms of speed. When we speak of "speed", we mean the speed in
searching stuff by activating multiple search engines at a time, in visiting
or closing out web pages, in bringing the world to you as fast as a lightening
bolt.

It is composed of Multiple Web Search Tool, Webpage Snatcher, HTML Component
Downloader, Web Filter, Internet Download Manager, RSS Reader, Web Page
e-Mailer, webpage translater, Map Tool, and a Plug-in UI open to add your own
Plug-ins, etc. Furthermore, special mouse gestures can be used everywhere,
such as switching tabs by scrolling up/down the mouse wheel and the drag and
drop of links.
