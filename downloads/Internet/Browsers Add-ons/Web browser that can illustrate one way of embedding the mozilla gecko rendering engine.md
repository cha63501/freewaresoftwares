uBrowser is a very simple web browser that can illustrate one way of embedding the Mozilla Gecko rendering engine into a standalone program using LibXUL. In this case, the contents of the page is grabbed as itA's being rendered and displayed as a texture on some geometry using OpenGL. 

You are able to interact with the page (mostly) normally and visit (almost) any site that works correctly with Firefox 1.5.
