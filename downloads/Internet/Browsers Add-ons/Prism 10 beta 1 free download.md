**Publisher's Description**  
  

Prism is an application that lets users split web applications out of their
browser and run them directly on their desktop.

Prism lets users add their favorite web apps to their desktop environment.
When invoked, these applications run in their own window. They are accessible
with Control-Tab, Command-Tab, and ExposA(c), just like desktop apps. And
users can still access these same applications from any web browser when they
are away from their own computers.

Prism isnAt a new platform, itAs simply the web platform integrated into the
desktop experience. Web developers donAt have to target it separately, because
any application that can run in a modern standards-compliant web browser can
run in Prism. Prism is built on Firefox, so it supports rich internet
technologies like HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and A'canvasA' and runs on Windows,
Mac OS X, and Linux.
