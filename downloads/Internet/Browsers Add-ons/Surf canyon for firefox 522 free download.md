Find stuff faster on Google, Yahoo! and Bing by digging out search results
from as deep as page 100. Surf Canyon automates the discovery of relevant
results buried in the search pages on Google, Yahoo! and Bing.

It also adds image previews to Craigslist. Simply enter your query at one of
these search engines as you always would. When you click a result that appeals
to you, the extension automatically re-ranks the result set in order to bring
forward what you need while suppressing what you donA't want. A'RecommendedA'
results can come from as deep as page 100. Settings and customizations are
available at http://my.SurfCanyon.com.
