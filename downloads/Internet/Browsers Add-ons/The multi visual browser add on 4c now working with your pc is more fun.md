**Publisher's Description**  
  


Working on the computer becomes intuitive, fast and efficient now. Thanks to the innovative browser add-on 4c. The one and only browser add-on that supports the visual memory. 

Websites are visualised with images and thus are recognised fast. Just click on the image to get to the website. History, favourites and other menue functions display websites as previews through simple mouseover function. 

4c uses the IE-control. So the most functions are well known by most of the users. But now you can forget the cryptic web addresses. 4c acts like memory and guide for you. Thus the revolutionary browser add-on 4c achieves to integrate the visualisation of websites or favourites within the navigation. E.g. click the backbutton or the fowardbutton and see previews of the sites youA've visited lately. 

As for navigation you only have to click the favoured preview. This simplicity of navigation works likewise for your history and favourites as an overview. This function is specially useful when working with searchengines. Furthermore the window administration functionalities make your work in the web much easier. Just the drag&drop function inside the windowsadministration simplies the usage of parallel IE windows enormously. 

4c is a browser add-on for everybody, especially if you stay lots of hours in the web each day, navigate to lots of different pages or you are just somebody who does not want to remember the cryptic URLs. Moreover, you can switch from one application to the other very fast, when using the visual overview of all applications on your computer. This is very helpful when working on presentations, in which you use content from different programs. 4c simplifies your work and simply is more fun!
