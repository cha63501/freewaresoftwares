Now available for Firefox 3, OutWit is the Web collection engine for everyone. It runs on your Windows, MacOS or Linux machine and allows you to browse through and easily grab information, collect media, contacts or files from the Internet, in a few clicks. 

Find pictures in galleries and search engines and download them to your hard disk or display online full screen slideshows in a single click. Have the program guess the structure of data you want to extract and export it as a clean spreadsheet to Excel... 

The Hub is the very first tool based on the OutWit platform. A free collection application and a complete Web harvesting environment in a single interface, OutWit Hub gathers a large series of recognition and extraction features to ease your Web searches, sort and organize your collections, make your own mashups. With or without programming or technical knowledge, you can create automatic agents to gather and format the information you seek. Automatically browse through pages, collect and format the information you seek. 

This free Firefox add-on is composed of a kernel, containing the library of functions and of an API, which will allow advanced users to build and distribute their own original tools -called outfits- using the features of the kernel for specific applications. Each outfit is a small XUL extension, with its own user interface, features, scripts, scrapers, directory of Web sources... 

The first outfit, OutWit Hub, is a multi-purpose development tool, meant to showcase a large number of the kernelA's features, to cover a large spectrum of needs. It will keep evolving and become an indispensible tool, both for data collection and for developing scripts, scrapers etc.

Works with Firefox 3.6 - 7.*
