**Publisher's Description**  
  

The DonationTree Shopper allows you to receive rebates when you shop online
via supported merchants. The rebates can be allocated to 529 College Savings,
Plans, schools of your choice, charities of your choice, or donated to other
websites of your choice. When a user visits a supported merchant, the
DonationTree Shopper allows the user to select whether they would like to
allocate the rebate or continue on to the merchant and receive no rebate.
DonationTree allows you to allocate your rebates to as many programs or
organizations as you wish.
