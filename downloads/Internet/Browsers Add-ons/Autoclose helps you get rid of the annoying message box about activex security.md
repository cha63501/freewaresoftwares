**Publisher's Description**  
  


_AutoClose_ helps you get rid of Internet ExplorerA's (IE) annoying message box about ActiveX objects. If you care about your computer security, you probably disable the download of ActiveX controls. However, in this case, whenever IE encounters ActiveX objects, it pops up a message box saying "**Your current security settings prohibit running ActiveX controls on this page. As a result, the page may not display correctly.**" There is no way to disable the display of this message box. You have to close it manually. _AutoClose_ does the job - automatically close the annoying message box - for you. (No installation needed. No mess up with the registry.)
