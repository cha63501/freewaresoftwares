**Publisher's Description**  
  

Newbie is an acronym for Network Enabled Web Browser Interface. It is designed
to allow users to manipulate Web pages by customizing Newbie scripts. These
scripts allow the user to automate Web page navigation by form filling Web
pages for you, so you can control how you use a Web site. It also manages
usernames and passwords to commonly visited sites that require user
authentication.

Version 1.5a now includes functions to allow data extraction from websites and
saving to a file for manipulation such as search results from Yahoo and Google
to an Excel file, and downloading URL files. You can also use it as a website
testing tool that repeatedly tests web pages and logs web page performance.
Newbie comes with an Editor and Pascal Compiler. Users familiar with the
Pascal language will find it easy to create Newbie Scripts. All information
the user provides is encrypted on the local PC using Blowfish Encryption. No
personal information is transferred over the Internet.
