**Publisher's Description**  
  

IESpell is a free Internet Explorer browser extension that spell-checks text-
input boxes on a Web page. It should come in particularly handy for users who
do a lot of Web-based text entry (Web mail, forums, blogs, diaries). Even if
your Web application already includes spell-checking functionality, this
utility is faster than a server-side solution. Plus, you get to store and use
your personal word list across all your applications instead of having to
maintain separate ones on each application.

The program installs as a new button in the IE toolbar (and as a new menu item
under Tools). After filling in a form, click the IESpell button and it pops up
a dialog similar to the Microsoft Word spelling checker. In version 2.1.1
build 325, ShowModalDialog can take any HTML elements, and support for
ignoring words marked with an underscore has been added.
