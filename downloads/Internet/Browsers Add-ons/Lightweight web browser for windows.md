**Publisher's Description**  
  


ThreeTeeth is a lightweight web browser for Windows XP, Vista, and 7. 

ThreeTeeth is similar to the Internet Explorer browser that everyone knows and loves, but without all those extra bells and whistles and tabs and menus and security popups and other extraneous stuff. You can only read one webpage at a time anyway, so why waste all that RAM and processor energy loading dozens of tabs?

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
