**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tri-core Avant Browser(Chrome,Firefox,IE),itA's user-friendly interface brings
a new level of clarity and efficiency to your browsing experience, and
frequent upgrades have steadily improved its reliability.

Multi-Processing: Multi-Processing design offers you a crash-free, lock-up-
free, memory-leak-free internet browsing experience and high reliability. When
one tab fails, it wonA't freeze the browser or pull other pages down. Online
Bookmarks: Access your Bookmarks with Avant Online Bookmarks Service from
anywhere, and donA't need to worry about losing those data when re-install
windows.. The encrypted stand-alone bookmarks file format can protect your
privacy on a shared computer.

AutoFills: Forgot a web password? Avant Browser will memorize passwords for
you. You can fill web forms with Auto-Filler by a single click. And you can
protect all your web forms with one master password.

Flash Animation Filter: Experiencing slow page loading with GPRS/3G
connection? More than 85% of all flash animations on web pages are
advertising, and normally take up to 90% of the size of the page youA're
visiting. With Avant Browser you can save the bandwidth by blocking the
download of these flash files with just one easy click.

AD/Pop-up Blocker: Easily eliminate unwanted AD banners and pop-up pages
automatically with just one click.

Mouse Gestures: If you click a link in the web page with the middle mouse
button, the link will be opened in a new window in the background. This
feature is extremely useful for opening posts in forums. Avant Browser also
comes with customizable Mouse Gestures, with which you can easily navigate the
browser by moving the mouse.

Private Browsing: Designed to set in a Private Mode, Avant Browser doesnA't
keep web data in your computer. So anybody else sharing the same computer with
you wonA't be able to see which pages you have visited and which files you
have displayed during your private web browsing section.
