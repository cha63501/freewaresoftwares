**Publisher's Description**  
  

From start to finish BilleoA's unique combination of features make any online
transaction--from shopping purchases to bill payments--easier, faster, and
more secure.

Billeo creates a private, encrypted vault on your own computer where all your
website login details and eWallet data are stored, available to assist you
just when you need it: You never have to remember a password or fill out a
form manually again.

With BilleoA's Offer Assistant, when you are searching for an item online your
search results will be tagged with the Billeo icon indicating that a discount
or several discounts are available for that item. This gives you the ability
to evaluate and choose discounts and rewards from banks, financial
institutions and online merchants in one place within the main, unsponsored
search results of the three most popular search engines: Google.com, Yahoo.com
or Bing.com.

Billeo can remind you of bills coming due, capture record of transaction
confirmation pages so you donA't have to print them, and display spending
reports.
