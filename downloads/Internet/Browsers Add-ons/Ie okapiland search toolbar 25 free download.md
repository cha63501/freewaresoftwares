**Publisher's Description**  
  

IE Okapiland Search Toolbar (IE Okapibar) is Internet search in Composite Page
Mode (CPM) that displays linked pages themselves in addition to hyperlinks.
All pages can be displayed by scrolling the pages. Internet Search is good for
the quick search or clear search, but the deep search or ambiguous search
requires your effort. The CPM can save your operation. To prevent unexpected
intruder at displaying the linked pages, the dynamic type of contents, e.g.
JavaScript or Applet, is not displayed.

Web search is provided with Yahoo! Search Web Services. Blog search is
provided with IceRocket (OpenSearch) APIs. IE Okapibar consists of a keyword
input, search engine buttons, and function buttons. The search engine button
selects either YahooCPM, IceRocketCPM or others. The function buttons are a
highlight button to change the background color of words same as the key
words, a compact button to change between one line and two line layout, and a
script button to show that Javascript is disable during the search in CPM. For
example, the usage of these search engines is that Yahoo or Google search is
for quick search, and Yahoo search in CPM is for deep search.
