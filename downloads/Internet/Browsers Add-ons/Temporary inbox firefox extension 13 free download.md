**Publisher's Description**  
  

This extension generates random disposable email addresses. Use those email
addresses for registration at forums, adult sites or whatever. The email
addresses donA't need registration. This is an easy way to avoid spam, because
the spamer never knows your private email address .. only the
temporaryinbox.com email address. And there the mails will be deleted after 6
hours.
