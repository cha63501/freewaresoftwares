**What's New in version 6.02:**

  * The installation doesn't move anymore the data files when they are in the Program Files folder. In case of an update, Wysigot searches for the database first in the executable's folder, then in the local AppData folder, and finally in the non local ("roaming") AppData folder. In case of a new install, the database is installed in the local AppData of the current user.
