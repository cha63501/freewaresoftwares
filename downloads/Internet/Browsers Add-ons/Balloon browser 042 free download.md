**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Balloon Browser recognizes and highlights geo-coordinates in web pages.
Hovering over a recognized location advises another application to show a map
of the corresponding area. For now the only program Balloow Browser can
interact with is Google Earth.

Instead of waiting for the one true geo-notation and markup standard, Balloon
Browser tries to parse a variety of common coordinate notations. Ambiguous
information like a missing hemisphere identifier are reconciled by looking at
the context or the probability of a certain location.

Thanks to the GPS system and low-cost devices that can be used by everybody,
the number of websites tagging their content with geo-coordinates (using
latitude and longitude) is increasing rapidly.
