**Publisher's Description**  
  

Quantum Browser is a tabbed, WebKit-based web browser developed by VBSplash
Applications. With it, you can do anything you want. You can do your banking
online, safely and securely; you can shop on Amazon or Ebay; you can browse
YouTube or post to Twitter; anything you can do in any other browser, you can
do with Quantum Browser. With its efficient multitabbed interface and clean,
minimalist design, you can focus on your content and take your attention off
of the browser itself. A variety of technical settings empowers enthusiasts to
tweak to their heartsA' content.

Quantum Browser will automatically update itself using VBSplashA's own
autoupdate system. Upon each initialization, Quantum Browser runs a check of
its own version number against the version number hosted on VBSplashA's
website. In the event that its version is succeeded by a new, updated version,
you will be prompted to update your browser. Please note that Quantum Browser
will only automatically update itself as long as you do not disable the
setting in the Settings menu.

Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 is absolutely necessary to run this software.
The installer will attempt to install it automatically, but in the event that
it fails to complete its job, you can find the .NET Framework 4.5.1 download
page [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773).
