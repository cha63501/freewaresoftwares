  * Internet Explorer, Versions 4.0 - 8.0 

**WhatA's New in version 1.75:**

  * Added limited support for Internet Explorer 10.0. On IE10, the cookies index file (index.dat), which stores information about every cookie file, is no longer used. Instead, the information is stored in .edb database which is locked for reading/writing by another process. Due to this change, when reading the cookies of IE10, the upper pane displays only partial information and some of the other features may not work properly.
