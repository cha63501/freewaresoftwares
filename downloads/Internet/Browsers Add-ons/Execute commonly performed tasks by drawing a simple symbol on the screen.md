**Publisher's Description**  
  


Mouse Gestures for Internet Explorer allow the user to execute commonly performed tasks (open/close a window) by drawing a simple symbol on the screen. 

  * A completely new gesture engine - Users are no longer restricted to the built in gestures. The gesture editor allows you to write your own! 
  * Updated mouse trails - You no longer need a high end graphics card to view mouse trails. The basic mouse trail (which, IMHO looks fantastic!) will work with the most basic of video cards 
  * Better scripting support - The Mouse Gestures plugin now exposes the internals of the gesture engine so you can write your own advanced scripts. 
  * Support for Windows x64 - IA've finally (!) been able to provide a 64-bit version of the plugin - huge thanks to Eric Lawrence at Microsoft for making this happen. 

Download the 64-bit version. [Mouse Gestures for Internet Explorer 2.1.2.2 64-bit](http://www.ysgyfarnog.co.uk/utilities/MouseGestures/MouseGestures_x64.exe). 

**What's New in version 2.1.2.2:**

  * Fixed bug when accessing mg.startAnchor (reference count wasn't being transferred to [out] object)
