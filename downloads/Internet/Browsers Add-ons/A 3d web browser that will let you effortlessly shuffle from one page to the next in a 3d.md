**Publisher's Description**  
  


SpaceTime 3D is a 3D web browser that will let you effortlessly shuffle from one page to the next in a 3D space. Your regular browser has one window. When you create a new web page, it replaces your old web page and gives you a tab. But what if you had unlimited space? What if you now had: here, there, and the space between? SpaceTime introduces this "space between" as the 3D Tabbed Browsing. 

Just enter your websites in the address line as you normally would and watch as your web pages are individually displayed in a stunning 3D space where you can view all of your web pages at the same time. Search eBay, Google, Yahoo!, Flickr and Images all in one 3D space.
