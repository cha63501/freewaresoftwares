A'Text to VoiceA' or A'Text to SpeechA' is one of the coolest Firefox add-ons.

the bottom right and this add-on speaks the selected text for you. IsnA't it
brilliant?

Here comes a speaking add-on. Literally, it speaks. Did you ever come across a
word which you were not sure how to pronounce? Ever wondered an easy way to
hear the word? This add-on is surely going to get a place on your best buddies
list. You only need to select the word/words to be pronounced and click the
button on the bottom right of your browser. ThatA's all. Your new buddy is
going to speak the word/words for you.

You can even download what you just heard. Yes, an audio file in MP3 format
can be downloaded from the same page. Right click on A'download mp3A' link,
select A'save link asA', select location on your computer and it downloads the
mp3 audio file there. Cheers!!!
