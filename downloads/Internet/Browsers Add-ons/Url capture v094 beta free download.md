**Publisher's Description**  
  

URL Capture saves all opened Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator windows
with their addresses and restores them on your demand. It can help to surf the
web at work (can hide IE windows on boss appearance) and at home (connection
failures). You can interrupt surfing at any time and start surfing from the
same position some hours or days later.
