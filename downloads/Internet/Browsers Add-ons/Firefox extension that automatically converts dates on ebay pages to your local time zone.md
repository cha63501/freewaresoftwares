**DATE/TIME CONVERSION:**

  * Automatically converts any times it finds on eBay pages to your local time. Intelligently adjusts for Daylight Savings time regardless of where you are located! 
  * Converts almost ANY date/time it finds on ANY eBay page, not just search listings. 
  * Gives you lots of options to customize the display of dates/times to be more readable: 
  * Use 24 or 12 hour time format with AM/PM indicators 
  * Substitute words like "Today" and "Tomorrow" for actual dates. 
  * Use the word "at" to separate date and time for better readability. 
  * Suppress the display of seconds in the time portion of the date if you like. 
  * Choose from 4 different date formats in either U.S. or European style. 
  * Add the name of the day of the week to the date. 
  * Customize the display of "AM" or "PM" to use periods or lower case if you prefer. 
  * Show an asterisk (or any characters you want) next to times which have been converted to your local time. 

**COUNTDOWN TIMER:**

  * Option to display a countdown timer on the Item Detail page which adds a real-time running countdown timer showing hours, minutes and seconds remaining until end of auction. 

**TOTAL PRICE CALCULATION:**

  * Automatically adds another column to search listings showing an itemA's total price including shipping. Now when sorting by price, listings will be sorted by total price and not bid price alone. 
  * Ability to highlight Total Prices which donA't include shipping in red to make them easier to spot.
