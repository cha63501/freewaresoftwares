**Publisher's Description**  
  

Lets you take a peek at the files and profiles under the hood of your Firefox
or Thunderbird installation and profile. Also works with XULRunner
applications (starting XULRunner 1.9a7)

Chrome List adds an "Explore Chrome..." item to the Tools menu, from which you
can:

  * browse the structure of chrome:// as if it were a normal directory tree. 
  * open chrome:// mapped files in Firefox/Thunderbird; 
  * view the source code of such files; 
  * save such files to somewhere else; 
  * inspect where the files are being mapped from (jar files, local directory, etc.); 
  * look for them in LXR; 
  * list possible problems with the Chrome Manifests in use in the Error Console; 

Note that this extension is not going to be very useful for you unless youA're
actually interested in the inner workings of Firefox, Thunderbird or (some of)
the extensions you have installed.

Works with Firefox: 2.0 A 3.0a9
