URL Snooper was written to help users locate the urls of audio and video files so that they can be recorded. 

Many links to streaming audio and video that you come across on the web are hidden behind javascript or activex scripts. Because of this, it is sometimes very difficult to figure out the actual urls that correspond to the streams being played.

  * New dynamic url filtering keywords. 
  * Improved context menu support, drag and drop file searching. 
  * Includes recording hints and website links. 
  * User customizable browser selection and favorites menu.
