Firefly is a web-browser that has been developed for children to use. It uses
an approval process to control the websites it can access. These websites are
identified by ChildrenAs Technology Workshop and the parents or supervisors of
the children who use the software.

Firefly is not a website filtering program. It does not prevent children from
using chat, accessing social networking websites or any other website, once
the site has been granted access by the supervising adult.

Firefly is simple to use.
