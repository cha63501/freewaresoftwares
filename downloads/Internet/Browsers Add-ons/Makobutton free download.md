**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you need quick access to a site, program, etc. from within Internet
Explorer, use MakoButton to create a custom button on the toolbar of Internet
Explorer. Tell the button to launch anything from a website, to your email
program, just about anything you want!

Images used for the buttons can be icons you have created or found at many
free sites on the internet. All icons must be .ico format. If some program has
installed a button on your toolbar, you can also remove, or modify it with
MakoButton.
