**Publisher's Description**  
  

Why settle for a basic build of your Firefox browser on Windows Operating
Systems when you can have one that performs 25% faster? Mozilla does not
provide optimized browser packages for Windows, while many Linux users get the
advantage of a browser built specifically for their system.

That needs to change! So, here is the Pale Moon project. Pale Moon is a custom
built and optimized Firefox-based browser.

**Features:**

  * Highly optimized for current processors
  * 100% Firefox sourced: As safe as the browser that has seen years of development.
  * Uses less memory because of disabled redundant and optional code
  * Significant speed increases for page drawing and script processing
  * Support for SVG and Canvas

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/Seven, 32-bit or 64-bit (64-bit O.S.es are not natively supported, but the browser will run fine on them) 
  * A 7th generation or later processor with SSE support like a Pentium III or Athlon XP or later 
  * 64 MB of RAM (128 MB or more recommended) 
  * At least 50 MB of free (uncompressed) disk space
