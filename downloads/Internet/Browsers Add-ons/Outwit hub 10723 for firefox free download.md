**Publisher's Description**  
  

Now available for Firefox 3, OutWit is the Web collection engine for everyone.
It runs on your Windows, MacOS or Linux machine and allows you to browse
through and easily grab information, collect media, contacts or files from the
Internet, in a few clicks.

Find pictures in galleries and search engines and download them to your hard
disk or display online full screen slideshows in a single click. Have the
program guess the structure of data you want to extract and export it as a
clean spreadsheet to Excel...

The Hub is the very first tool based on the OutWit platform. A free collection
application and a complete Web harvesting environment in a single interface,
OutWit Hub gathers a large series of recognition and extraction features to
ease your Web searches, sort and organize your collections, make your own
mashups. With or without programming or technical knowledge, you can create
automatic agents to gather and format the information you seek. Automatically
browse through pages, collect and format the information you seek.

This free Firefox add-on is composed of a kernel, containing the library of
functions and of an API, which will allow advanced users to build and
distribute their own original tools -called outfits- using the features of the
kernel for specific applications. Each outfit is a small XUL extension, with
its own user interface, features, scripts, scrapers, directory of Web
sources...

The first outfit, OutWit Hub, is a multi-purpose development tool, meant to
showcase a large number of the kernelA's features, to cover a large spectrum
of needs. It will keep evolving and become an indispensible tool, both for
data collection and for developing scripts, scrapers etc.

Works with Firefox 3.6 - 7.*

**Supported Operating Systems:** Win XP/2003/Vista, MacOS X, Linux.
