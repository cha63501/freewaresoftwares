**Publisher's Description**  
  


Adblock Plus is an extension that will help you get rid of the ads and banners on the internet that make the loading time of a webpage a lot higher. 

Right-click on a banner and choose "Adblock" from the context menu - the banner won't be downloaded again. Maybe even replace parts of the banner address with star symbols to block similar banners as well.

Or you select a filter subscription when Adblock Plus starts up the first time, then even this simple task will usually be unnecessary: the filter subscription will block most advertisements fully automatically.

**Minimal Requirements:** Firefox 3.5, Firefox Mobile (Fennec) 1.0, Thunderbird 3.0, SeaMonkey 2.0, Songbird 1.9, Prism 1.0 Beta 1.
