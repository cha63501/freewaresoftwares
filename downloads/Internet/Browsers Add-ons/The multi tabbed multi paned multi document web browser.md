**Publisher's Description**  
  


Muddly is designed as an additional tool for users of Microsoft Internet Explorer. It's aimed particularly at researchers, professionals, power users - anybody needing more browsing power and a better way of organizing their web activity and archive. 

It gives you more control of your browsing by providing multi-paned viewing, for instance 'Side By Side' or 'Top And Bottom' views with stackable tabbed viewing. What constitutes a 'Tab' in Internet Explorer is a 'Document' in Muddly - a collection of tabs and panes that can be saved in our document file format - a *.mud file.

Mud files are saved wherever you want on your pc or network file system. By harnessing the power of the file system you gain a powerful tool for organizing your web archive.
