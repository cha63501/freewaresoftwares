**Publisher's Description**  
  

uBrowser is a very simple web browser that can illustrate one way of embedding
the Mozilla Gecko rendering engine into a standalone program using LibXUL. In
this case, the contents of the page is grabbed as itA's being rendered and
displayed as a texture on some geometry using OpenGL.

You are able to interact with the page (mostly) normally and visit (almost)
any site that works correctly with Firefox 1.5.
