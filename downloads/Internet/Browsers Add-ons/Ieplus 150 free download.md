**Publisher's Description**  
  

IEPlus is an add-on for MicrosoftA(c) Internet Explorer, which brings you more
convenience for plain Internet Explorer (features like browse history
management, super drag and drop, etc.) and thus to make your surfing fun and
more comfortable, with only minimum resource requirement.

IEPlus will enrich your browse experience with features like close tab when
double clicked, super drag and drop, browse history management, multi-proxy
management, mouse gesture, ads block based on URL and content, URL shortcuts,
enhanced crash recovery, hotkey and a powerful plugin system ready to be
extended. It works both for the newest IE7 and Vista, and also for the
mainstream IE6 and Windows XP. Since IEPlus does not need to re-invent the
wheel time and again and depends on Internet ExplorerA's standard interfaces,
it thus is more stable and better than most third party multi-tab browsers
based on Internet Explorer core.

IEPlus is fully compatible with Internet Explorer 5.5/6.0/7.0 (features
relavant with Tabs are only available in Internet Explorer 7) and Windows
2000/XP/2003/Vista, and we recommend you to use it in Internet Explorer 6 or
later. IEPlus is small, easy to use and comsumes minimum resource. During your
use of it, you will gradually feel how much convenience IEPlus can bring to
you.
