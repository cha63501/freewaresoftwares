**Publisher's Description**  
  

MyLastSearch utility scans the cache and history files of your Web browser,
and locates all search queries that you made with the most popular search
engines (Google, Yahoo and MSN) and with popular social networking sites
(Twitter, Facebook, MySpace).

The search queries that you made are displayed in a table with the following
columns: Search Text, Search Engine, Search Time, Search Type (General, Video,
Images), Web Browser, and the search URL.

You can select one or more search queries and then copy them to the clipboard
or save them into text/html/xml file.

**WhatA's New in version 1.62:**

  * Fixed issue with Chrome Web browser: MyLastSearch loaded only 4 data files: data_0, data_1, data_2, data_3. It seems that when the cache of Chrome is large enough, it starts to create more cache data files (data_4, data_5...) Starting from this version, MyLastSearch will read these additional cache data files.
