ChicagoA's New Neighborhood Browser - Get Local! 

Fave is the first Aneighborhood browserA freeware that accesses, retrieves, prioritizes, and saves information from an exclusive neighborhood commercial database, and presents only relevant results to the user by proximity in an uncluttered, continuously updated, searchable, and web-linked format. 

Fave comes loaded with 350,000 northeastern Illinois businesses and organizations, many of which cannot be found through ordinary search engines, all key-worded, categorized, and geo-located by neighborhood, zip code, and town. Results are listed for consumers by proximity to where they are, or to where they will shortly be, accompanied by maps, contact information, and Web site links. 

FaveAs greatest delight is its dozens of entertaining, value-driven videos. Small business clients can now afford to create and deliver TV-style videos and appear on page one of local search results for a small fraction of the price of cable production and media.

Fave also protects personal identity and information. It performs searches and stores the results locally, meaning thereAs no tracking history nor search profiling.

When you search for products and services, you sometimes consider used goods as an alternative to new. Fave provides a market for users to buy and sell their own products through the software: this craigslist-like feature gives users the option to post their own goods for consideration in searches. Buyers see paid advertisements, business listings, and classifieds in a single results page.

Fave also features a built-in electronic communication system that allows users to immediately contact potential vendors by both instant message and e-mail without having to look up their electronic addresses.

Fave finds it fast. Fave finds it local. Look Around!
