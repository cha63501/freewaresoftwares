**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Yellowpipe RightLynx tool is an addition to the right-click menu for
Firefox, allowing you to preview the page you are on with a Lynx Viewer.

With just one click, and without living the page (RightLynx opens in a new,
small window) you can see what a page will look like when viewed with Lynx , a
text-mode web browser. It is also presumably, how search engines see your
site. In addition to that, it can help determine if web pages are accessible
to the vision impaired.
