**Publisher's Description**  
  

Firefox Okapiland Search Toolbar (Firefox Okapibar) is Internet search in
Composite Page Mode (CPM) that displays linked pages themselves in addition to
hyperlinks. All pages can be displayed by scrolling the pages. Internet Search
is good for the quick search or clear search, but the deep search or ambiguous
search requires your effort. The CPM can save your operation. To prevent
unexpected intruder at displaying the linked pages, the dynamic type of
contents, e.g. JavaScript or Applet, is not displayed.

Web search is provided with Yahoo! Search Web Services. Blog search is
provided with IceRocket (OpenSearch) APIs. Firefox Okapibar consists of a
keyword input, search engine buttons, and function buttons. The search engine
button selects either YahooCPM, IceRocketCPM or others. The function buttons
are a highlight button to change the background color of words same as the key
words, a compact button to change between one line and two line layout, and a
script button to show that Javascript is disable during the search in CPM. For
example, the usage of these search engines is that Yahoo or Google search is
for quick search, and Yahoo search in CPM is for deep search.
