**Publisher's Description**  
  

Paint on webpages! Select any image on a webpage, deface it and share your
artwork on Facebook!

After you have installed the Dfacer add-on, a new :{ -button appears in the
addon bar of your Firefox. While surfing you can click it, select an image
from the open page and paint on it. When you are ready, you will get a link to
give for your friends. They will need to have Dfacer add-on installed to view
your artwork inside the original web page. However, the painting itself is
going to be visible without the add-on too, even for users with different
browsers.

With Dfacer we want to encourage primitive creativity in office environments,
suggest political satire over every instant of news imagery, and discuss the
essence of digital files: Is there an original? Who cares!

**Requires:** Firefox 4.0 and above.
