**Publisher's Description**  
  

SpoofStick is a simple browser extension that helps users detect spoofed
(fake) websites. A spoofed website is typically made to look like a well
known, branded site (like ebay.com or citibank.com) with a slightly different
or confusing URL. The attacker then tries to trick people into going to the
spoofed site by sending out fake email messages or posting links in public
places - hoping that some percentage of users wonA't notice the incorrect URL
and give away important information. This practice is sometimes known as
Aphishing".
