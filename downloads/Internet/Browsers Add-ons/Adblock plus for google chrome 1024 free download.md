**Publisher's Description**  
  

Adblock Plus is an extension that will help you get rid of the ads and banners
on the internet that make the loading time of a webpage a lot higher.

Right-click on a banner and choose "Adblock" from the context menu - the
banner wonA't be downloaded again. Maybe even replace parts of the banner
address with star symbols to block similar banners as well.

Or you select a filter subscription when Adblock Plus starts up the first
time, then even this simple task will usually be unnecessary: the filter
subscription will block most advertisements fully automatically.
