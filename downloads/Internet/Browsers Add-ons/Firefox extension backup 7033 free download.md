**Publisher's Description**  
  

FEBE allows you to quickly and easily backup your Firefox extensions. In fact,
it goes beyondFEBE license plate just backing up -- It will actually rebuild
your extensions individually into installable .xpi files. Now you can easily
synchronize your office and home browsers.

FEBE backs up and restores your extensions, themes, and (optionally) your
bookmarks, preferences, cookies. and much more.

Backup as little or as much of your Firefox environment as you wish. Perform
backups on demand or schedule daily, weekly, or monthly unattended runs.
Sequential backups can be stored in timestamped directories so you can restore
back as far as you like.

You may specify "User-defined" items to have FEBE backup Thunderbird,
Greasemonkey scripts, or virtually any data on your computer - Firefox related
or not.

Works with Firefox 4.0.* - 12.*.

  * For Fx 4.0.* - 12.*
