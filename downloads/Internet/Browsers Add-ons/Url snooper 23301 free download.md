**Publisher's Description**  
  

URL Snooper was written to help users locate the urls of audio and video files
so that they can be recorded.

Many links to streaming audio and video that you come across on the web are
hidden behind javascript or activex scripts. Because of this, it is sometimes
very difficult to figure out the actual urls that correspond to the streams
being played.

The goal of is to provide a one-stop easy solution to finding the URLs for all
streams. It does this by watching network traffic and identifying potential
urls, especially streaming media urls.

**Features:**

  * Totally revamped and cleaner user interface. 
  * Smart packet spanning - rebuilds packet streams to eliminate split-urls. 
  * Improved identification of protocols, duplicates, and url arguments. 
  * New dynamic url filtering keywords. 
  * Improved context menu support, drag and drop file searching. 
  * Includes recording hints and website links. 
  * User customizable browser selection and favorites menu.
