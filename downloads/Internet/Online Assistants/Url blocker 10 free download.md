New software program helps those who want to stop visiting specific websites
for a specific period of time help self-control their addiction to specific
sites. The URL Blocker lets the user choose which site or sites to block
according to a date or number of minutes or hours that they also choose. Once
a block is activated, the user cannot de-activate it except by uninstalling
the program.

This is a great program if you do not have self control and find yourself
wasting time on social networking sites, video sites or any other site that
distracts you from your task at hand.

The URL Blocker works for all Windows-based computers, and unlike other
blocking software, takes effect automatically on both Internet Explorer and
Firefox.

The program includes password protection, preventing others from blocking web
browsing without the userA's knowledge or permission. No data is collected
before users can download the program, and the URL Blocker shows no ads. ItA's
100% free from ComputerHelp.com.
