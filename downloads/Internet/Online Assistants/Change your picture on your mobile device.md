**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pix2Gsm is a free software interface that works with the m-bootA's pixcatcher mobile interface. Easily put pictures on your mobile device without an expensive bluetooth dongle. 

**Features:**

  * The ability to use bmp files without external conversion. (unsupported with the basic portal). 
  * It is able to remember your phone number and fill it automatically. 
  * It gives the possiblity to build a database of pictures (or online, or on your computer), so you can easily preview the files that you can use in your mobile. 
  * English and french software. 
  * As some totally useless tools, like a tiny mail builder to warn your friend that you have a new picture on your mobile (in the next version we will work on html mail) and is able to store some address to the people you want to send the url of your picture. (it is always nice to put an online picture on your mobile but if you had rather a prebuilt picture or ringtones, you can have a look here). 
  * Customize the software and set your very own color set (you can use some original colors or use a map in order the software look nearly like your mobileA's colors to get a best preview.)
