**Publisher's Description**  
  

Webcam Diagnostics is a simple assistant which gathers many system and webcam-
related information in a single place. It makes it easy to identify driver
installation problems or USB issues: red circles will signal serious issues
and yellow triangles will signal minor issues. Right-click a reported issue to
access the context menu and click the Fix menu (if available) so that the
program attempts to fix the issue or shows you a possible way to fix it.

Webcam Diagnostics can report USB issues like overcurrent or bandwidth
shortage. It can also tell whether your system is correctly configured to
handle a webcam (e.g. processor fast enough, recent DirectX runtime, optimal
display color depth, etc.)
