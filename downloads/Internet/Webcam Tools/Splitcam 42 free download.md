**Publisher's Description**  
  

SplitCam virtual video capture driver allows for connecting several
applications to a single video capture source. For example, if you have a web-
camera connected to your computer you cannot use it in more than one
application at the same time - thereAs no standard Windows options that would
make it possible. SplitCam does just what it name says: it splits the video
stream coming from the video source and provides it to other client
application.

  * Choose almost any video source as a primary video capture device. 
  * Digital zoom.

  * Use any of the wide range of resolutions in client applications: 160x120, 320x240, 640x480, etc. 
  * Every application can have its own video resolution.
