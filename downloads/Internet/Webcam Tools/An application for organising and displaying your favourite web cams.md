**Publisher's Description**  
  


Camembert is a freeware application for organising and displaying your favourite web cams. 

**Features:**

  * Camembert was designed for use by those with a fixed Internet connection that provides continuous access to the Web. Modem users who get free local phone calls should also find it useful. You donA't need a fast connection, just an inexpensive one. 
  * Camembert will work if youA're behind a firewall, provided that you set up the proxy option. However, it may not be able to get fresh images if the proxy has a cache. 
  * Camembert features an experimental remote configuration system.
