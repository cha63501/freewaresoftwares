**Publisher's Description**  
  

ROT13 was designed for use in the newsgroups as a means to "hide" the content
of postings. Another way ROT13 has been used is scrambling e-mail addresses in
the contents of news articles, making it difficult for Internet spammers to
steal the addresses.

_Note that ROT13 is not secure._
