**Publisher's Description**  
  


Allows a URL to be redirected from one port to another. The program is multi-threaded and is currently running on a Windows 2000 server, but should work on any Windows machine. It was tested on XP and Win 2000. It was used to redirect a web mail system which was setup on port 1000. Later it was moved to port 80, but instead of notifying all the customers to change their settings we put this program on to save the time.
