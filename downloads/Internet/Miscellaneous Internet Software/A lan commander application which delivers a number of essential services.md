**Publisher's Description**  
  


Kaboodle is a LAN commander application which delivers a number of essential services useful to any small LAN administrator. Kaboodle can automatically detect your LAN population, help you take remote-control of what it finds, and can be used to securely connect two LANs together across the Internet. Kaboodle is designed to enable some really useful network capabilities even for the "average" Internet user -- ie, someone who knows their email address but not their IP address.
