**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Buyertools Reminder is a completely free eBay sniper tool. It allows
automatic bidding up to a few seconds before an auction ends. The Buyertools
Reminder can also establish the Internet connection which is required for auto
bidding at a predetermined time and close it down after bidding.  
  
Of course, manual bidding straight out of the program is possible, too.  
  
The program reminds you of auctions ending soon by alert or free text message
on your cell phone.  
  
The Buyertools Reminder is not just a sniper tool, but also a lean organizer
that administers your personal appointments and dates.
