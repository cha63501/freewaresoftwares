**Publisher's Description**  
  


ROT13 was designed for use in the newsgroups as a means to "hide" the content of postings. Another way ROT13 has been used is scrambling e-mail addresses in the contents of news articles, making it difficult for Internet spammers to steal the addresses. 

_Note that ROT13 is not secure._
