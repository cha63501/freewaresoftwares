**Publisher's Description**  
  

FlashCookiesView is a small utility that displays a list of cookie files
created by Flash component (Local Shared Object) in your Web browser. For each
cookie file, the lower pane of FlashCookiesView displays the content of the
file in readable format or as Hex dump.

You can also select one or more cookie files, and then copy them to the
clipboard, save them to text/html/xml file or delete them.

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and
up to Windows 7. Also, FlashCookiesView can work with any Web browser, because
the Flash component always save flash cookies in the same place and in the
same format, regardless the Web browser that you use.

**What's New in version 1.12:**

  * Added 'Mark Odd/Even Rows' option, under the View menu. When it's turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to make it easier to read a single line. 
  * Added 'Add Header Line To CSV/Tab-Delimited File' option. When this option is turned on, the column names are added as the first line when you export to csv or tab-delimited file.
