Easy Photo Uploader for Facebook allows you to resize and upload photos to
existing or new Facebook photo album.

Send pictures without being online on Facebook web site. Because Facebook has
become so popular and people like to share their pictures with friends and
family, you need a quick software to upload new photo albums.

It works like a batch uploader for Facebook albums. As we are very lazy users,
we spent a few hours to make this freeware available for all people who want
to save time and share even more pictures in Facebook.

Easy Photo Uploader is both a shell menu extension and a software. Directly
from the windows file explorer, select your picture(s), right click and select
the menu item "Send your photo(s) to Facebook".

Select your account, select or create a Facebook album, and the program will
resize to the maximum resolution allowed by Facebook. Easily speeding up the
transfer by resizing directly on your computer before submitting the files to
Facebook. Easy and simple.. simply addictive software for Facebook fan.

Easy Photo Uploader can use installed WIC codec, so you can also directly
upload your raw photo files (.CR2,.NEF,.MRW,etc..) they will be converted to
Jpeg automatically for you with the highest quality possible (you can change
this in the settings of the application).
