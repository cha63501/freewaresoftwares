What do you do if you want to access some content online only to find that it is censored in your region? This situation does not have to disappoint you anymore. There are commercial programs you can buy to access blocked sites. However, this may not be an ideal solution for you because you may be interested in only one such site, or you may not be interested in something fancy. Whether you want a simple program or something that gives you more options, Hola! has a solution for you. 

The software integrates into popular Web browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, and it is compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux and Android operating systems. The providers offer free and paid VPN services to meet the needs of different consumers.

**Hola! Features**

  * Provides access to all blocked sites 
  * Works on multiple platforms 
  * Provides anonymity 
  * Enhances security by providing dynamic IP 
  * Hides usersA locations to prevent tracking 
  * Speeds up Internet access 
  * Saves on bandwidth costs using compression technology 
  * Creates social Internet as users increase 

**Using Hola!**

We had the option to add browser extensions during installation or skip the process. We decided to install the extensions. Once the installation was complete, the applicationAs icon appeared in the system tray. When we moused over the icon, we had the option to accelerate the connection or unblock access to restricted sites.

The program is suitable for all types of users because it has simple and advanced modes for inexperienced and experienced users respectively.

Hola! automatically made necessary connections, and the browser extension allowed us to select new connection routes. When we reached a restricted site, the service gave us a list of VPNs we could use to access them from a different country or region.

Although the browser extension offered no Internet acceleration, it helped us avoid re-downloading content by caching data. While some VPN services slow things down, Hola! does the opposite by sending only traffic to blocked websites through different servers.

**Pros**

  * Easy to use 
  * Automatically re-routes connections based on accessed websites 
  * Provides multiple connections 
  * Increases Internet speed 

**Cons**

  * Some sites or apps do not respond on some websites
