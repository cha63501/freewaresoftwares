**Publisher's Description**  
  

SI Trace is a free visual tool for Windows that traces the route of IP packets
while they travel from your PC to the remote destination. The tool essentially
allows you to see exactly where a connectivity problem is, no matter how far
it is from your computer. The last host to respond to traceroute is the last
host that is working properly. The first one that fails to respond is the
faulty one.
