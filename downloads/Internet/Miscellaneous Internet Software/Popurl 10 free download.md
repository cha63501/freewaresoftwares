**Publisher's Description**  
  

popURL is a small Windows tool that displays useful information from an HTTP
URL, such as the remote serverA's software and the particulars of the file to
be fetched. This data can be useful in a diagnostic or security context.

To use, simply copy an HTTP URL to the clipboard (e.g. A'Copy Link LocationA'
in your web browser) and then left-click the A'UA' icon in the tray. A popup
will appear, showing you various information about the URL.

  * **Site name:** The base site in the URL. Click the A'SA' button on the right to automatically launch your web browser and visit the base site URL. 
  * **Web server:** The serverA's software, for example IIS or Apache. Sites on some platforms, such as Microsoft IIS, may pose more of a risk than others. Click the A'WA' button to launch a Google search for the server type. 
  * **MIME type:** The MIME Content-Type for the file, as reported by the web server. This identifies whether a URL is text, multimedia, etc. Click the A'MA' button to launch a Google search for the given media type. 
  * **File size:** The MIME Content-Length for the file. This field is often not present for dynamically generated content. popURL will also display the size in kilobytes (2^10) and megabytes (2^20). 
The complete server response is also displayed in the scrolling window near
the top of the popup. NOTE THAT SERVER RESPONSES MAY INCLUDE FORGED DATA.
