**Publisher's Description**  
  

URL Thing is a free utility that lets you see the raw results of an HTTP query
to any URL.

It allows the user to view the full HTTP headers which can be useful in
troubleshooting efforts. It also provides the time it took for the server to
respond, and the length of the response in bytes.

The results of the HTTP request can be either copied to the clipboard or saved
to a file.
