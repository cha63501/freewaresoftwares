**Publisher's Description**  
  

ALJ is a program for exporting complete userA's journal including all comments
into plain files. Once journal is downloaded, program can check if new entries
are available, download them and add to plain file.

Features: Unlike similar programs, ALJ downloading journal simultaneously
using several threads, which makes it slightly faster and also it is
downloading posts with more than 1 page of comments.

Since some journals could be really big in size, program breaks plain file
into smaller pieces of 1MB, so that IE can handle this files. All parts are
linked to each other for easy navigation and program itself can re-use these
files for downloading new entries, which eliminates need of keeping original
pages received from livejournal web site.

Because plain file is at least 2-4 times more compact than original pages,
this could save you lots of disk space and reduces searching time through the
pages. Program uses IE cookie in your system when its downloading, so it will
see your and other peopleA's posts according to your actual permissions.
