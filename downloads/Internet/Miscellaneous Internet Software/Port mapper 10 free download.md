Port Mapper is a freeware tool which helps home users open/close ports in
their routers and gateways securely. It automatically maps and manages ports
in the router, enabling online multiplayer game play without disturbing the
gaming session.

Port Mapper is more secure than manually opening and closing ports, because it
opens the ports only when needed and automatically closes them when you are
finished playing. Port Mapper works with your Internet gateway/router in such
a way that you can have control on the programs that communicate over your
network. Using Port Mapper, you can expose applications to your friends over
the internet in a safe manner.

It also supports wireless connectivity and notifies you when you go out of
range of the gateway. If you are a gaming freak who loves gaming on the
internet and donA't want to be disturbed with the manual opening and closing
of ports at your router, you are sure gonna love this tiny tool.
