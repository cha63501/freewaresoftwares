Host Availability Monitor monitors the availability of multiple hosts by
connecting to them on timed intervals and on the appropriate protocol and
port. It can notify you by E-mail, program execution (ie- net send), or HTTP
query when any of the hosts go down or come back up. It can also create a web
page of the hostsA' status on interval and upload it to an FTP server.

**Note:** The free edition allows users to monitor 3 hosts.
