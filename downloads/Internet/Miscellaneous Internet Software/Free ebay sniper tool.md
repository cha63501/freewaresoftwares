**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Buyertools Reminder is a completely free eBay sniper tool. It allows automatic bidding up to a few seconds before an auction ends. The Buyertools Reminder can also establish the Internet connection which is required for auto bidding at a predetermined time and close it down after bidding.   
  
Of course, manual bidding straight out of the program is possible, too.   
  
The program reminds you of auctions ending soon by alert or free text message on your cell phone.   
  
The Buyertools Reminder is not just a sniper tool, but also a lean organizer that administers your personal appointments and dates.
