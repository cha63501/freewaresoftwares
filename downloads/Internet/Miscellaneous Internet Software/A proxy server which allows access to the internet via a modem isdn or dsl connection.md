**Publisher's Description**  
  


The JanaServer 2 is amongst other things a proxy server, that makes it possible for LAN members, everyone or a group as a part of the LAN, to access the internet via a Modem, ISDN or DSL connection. For this the utility must be installed on the computer, that can access the internet by an installed modem, ISDN or a DSL adapter. No additional program on the other LAN computers is necessary. 

Furthermore the JanaServer is an e-mail server that permits the users on the local net to send each other e-mails or make it possible for every single user to send e-mails over the internet. Every user can have his e.mail account with a different provider. A HTTP server, which allows testing of local web sites or to serve an intranet, is also integrated. It is possible to set up Perl/CGI-, PHP3/4- and ASP-scripts for several functions you may want to have.

Further functions which are incorporated in the program: a FTP server, a DNS forewarder, acting as a DNS server in a LAN and gateway functions for FTP programs, Telnet, Newsreader and custom gateways.

Jana isnA't a Router or NAT-(Network Address Translation) software, so that programs without Proxy/Firewall settings are not able to connect directly to the internet because no ports can be opened. This mainly concerns games and audio/video software over internet. Some of these programs may work with tools like HummingbirdA's socks client or Sockscap.

For private use, schools, non-profit organisations etc. JanaServer 2 remains "Freeware". For commercial use JanaServer 2 becomes "Shareware". If you want to carry on using JanaServer 2 after an evaluation period of 30 days, you must register JanaServer 2.
