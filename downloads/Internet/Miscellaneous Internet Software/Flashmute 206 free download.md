**Publisher's Description**  
  

FlashMute is a tool which allows you to mute/unmute Flash movies viewed in web
browsers. The muting will not affect any other programs, so music played from
your favorite music player will continue as normal. YouA'll no longer have to
fear noisy "fun" flashes, nor ads with sound.

You can optionally configure FlashMute to also block other sounds from a
browser, for instance embedded wave or midi files. FlashMute is light weight
and easy to use, and can be controlled eithery by use of a tray icon or a
hotkey.
