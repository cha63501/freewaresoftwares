**Publisher's Description**  
  

Windows Live Writer is a desktop application that makes it easier to compose
compelling blog posts using Windows Live Spaces or your current blog service.

Blogging has turned the web into a two-way communications medium. Our goal in
creating Writer is to help make blogging more powerful, intuitive, and fun for
everyone.

Writer has lots of features which we hope make for a better blogging
experience. Some of the ones we are most excited about include:

  * WYSIWYG Blog Authoring 
  * Photo Publishing - Writer makes inserting, customizing, and uploading photos to your blog a snap. 
  * Map Publishing - insert a Windows Live Local map directly into a post. 
  * Writer SDK - extend the capabilities of Writer to publish additional content types. 
  * Compatibility - works with other weblogs including Blogger, LiveJournal, TypePad, WordPress (and many others).
