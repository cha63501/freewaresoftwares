Millions of electronic texts are available on the Internet, many of them free. However, trying to read them in your word processor is an excellent recipe for eye strain. Book Reader for Windows makes it easy to read e-texts, and you can read huge files: up to 5 megs in size. The program is simple to use, and has several handy features, which include: automatic removal of DOS formatting; support for CP866; storage of book filenames; storage of preferred font and color settings; a visual reading progress indicator; and the program saves your position in the text when you exit. The Color Scheme dialogue lets you view your choice of text color and font color with sample text, so that you can choose different colors with ease.
