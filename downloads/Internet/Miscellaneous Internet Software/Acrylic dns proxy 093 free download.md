**Publisher's Description**  
  

Acrylic is a local DNS proxy which improves the performance of your computer
by caching the responses coming from your DNS servers. What it does is to
reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses
closest to zero possible.

With it you can also gracefully overcome short downtimes of your DNS servers
without disrupting your work, because in this case you will at least be able
to connect to your favourite websites and to your e-mail server. In addition
it can help you to effectively block unwanted ads prior to their download
through the use of HOSTS files, optimizing your navigation experience even
further.

Acrylic is released as open source, which means that itA's completely free and
its source code, written in ObjectPascal with Borland Delphi 7, is freely
available to anyone under the GNU General Public License.
