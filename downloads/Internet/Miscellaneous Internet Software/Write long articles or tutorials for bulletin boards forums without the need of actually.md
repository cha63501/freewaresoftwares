**Publisher's Description**  
  


BBCoder was developed for people who write long articles or tutorials for bulletin boards (forums) without the need of actually being at a bulletin board or even being online at all for that matter allowing you to get that article finished.   
  
BBCoder has all the standard tags you would find at most common bulletin boards, a full list of these of these tags can be found in the BBCoder help file.   
  
BBCoder will convert the bbcode to html for the preview so you can see exactly how your article will look when posted. BBCoder also includes a full feathered tabbed browser with bookmarks making it even easer to keep track of your favorite forums and post your articles.   
  
With the auto copy feather of BBCoder, when you switch from BBCoder to BBBrowser your article is automatically copied to the windows clipboard ready for you to paste at any of the forums.
