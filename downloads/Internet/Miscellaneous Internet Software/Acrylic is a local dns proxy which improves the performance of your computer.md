**Publisher's Description**  
  


Acrylic is a local DNS proxy which improves the performance of your computer by caching the responses coming from your DNS servers. What it does is to reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses closest to zero possible. 

With it you can also gracefully overcome short downtimes of your DNS servers without disrupting your work, because in this case you will at least be able to connect to your favourite websites and to your e-mail server. In addition it can help you to effectively block unwanted ads prior to their download through the use of HOSTS files, optimizing your navigation experience even further. 

Acrylic is released as open source, which means that itA's completely free and its source code, written in ObjectPascal with Borland Delphi 7, is freely available to anyone under the GNU General Public License.
