**Publisher's Description**  
  

The name should already say it. But okay, IA'll explain it. With my program
you can retrieve the source code or the header of a webpage easily, fast and
without a browser. It can be very practical if you try to work out some
javascript hackits or just donA't want to be annoyed with advertisements.
Furthermore, one can check suspicious websites before launching them in a
browser.
