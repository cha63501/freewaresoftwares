**Publisher's Description**  
  

Millions of electronic texts are available on the Internet, many of them free.
However, trying to read them in your word processor is an excellent recipe for
eye strain. Book Reader for Windows makes it easy to read e-texts, and you can
read huge files: up to 5 megs in size. The program is simple to use, and has
several handy features, which include: automatic removal of DOS formatting;
support for CP866; storage of book filenames; storage of preferred font and
color settings; a visual reading progress indicator; and the program saves
your position in the text when you exit. The Color Scheme dialogue lets you
view your choice of text color and font color with sample text, so that you
can choose different colors with ease.
