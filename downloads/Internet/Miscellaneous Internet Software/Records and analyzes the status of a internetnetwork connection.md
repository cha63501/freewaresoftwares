**Publisher's Description**  
  


LiveCon! is a simple Windows status tray utility which records and analyzes the status of a Internet/network connection over a given period of time. The produced analysis can be used, for example, to determine when connection difficulties have occurred which, in turn, can be submitted to request credit compensation (i.e. from an ISP) during an outage.
