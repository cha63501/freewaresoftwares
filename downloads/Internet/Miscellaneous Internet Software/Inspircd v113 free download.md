**Publisher's Description**  
  

InspIRCd is a modular C++ IRC Daemon for Linux, BSD and Windows systems
created to provide a stable, modern, lightweight ircd (irc server) from
scratch and provide a vast number of features in a modularised form using an
advanced module API. By keeping the functionality of the main core to a
minimum we hope to increase the stability and speed of our project and make it
customisable to the needs of many users.

InspIRCd is designed primarily to be a custom irc server for the chatspike irc
network (irc.chatspike.net) but we are releasing it into the public domain
under GPL so that you may benefit yourself from our work. The project is
written from scratch, avoiding the inherent instability under large loads
which can be seen in many other irc server distributions which have the same
featureset.
