**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program is an FTP checker written in C# (.NET). Allows to check a series of FTP servers and determine in which state it is: extinguished, connection refused, no route to host, wrong username and password, FTP connection error, or all works fine. In case all works fine, a welcome message and a login message are displayed in both text and ANSI VT100 format. Moreover you can save to disk or print to paper a report of the status of the outcome check of the FTP servers. 

The program was written using a plugin architecture, whick allows to load an FTP server list to check and to save a report prospect, using .DLL files exteriors to the program. This allows to work with various file formats and even on various data sources (you could write a plugin which can read and save data across internet). With this system is offered the possibility to write a plugin for anyone who wants to make it, and expand the software as wished. This version works fine but is in developing phase, hard work is still to follow.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
