**Publisher's Description**  
  

Kaboodle is a LAN commander application which delivers a number of essential
services useful to any small LAN administrator. Kaboodle can automatically
detect your LAN population, help you take remote-control of what it finds, and
can be used to securely connect two LANs together across the Internet.
Kaboodle is designed to enable some really useful network capabilities even
for the "average" Internet user -- ie, someone who knows their email address
but not their IP address.
