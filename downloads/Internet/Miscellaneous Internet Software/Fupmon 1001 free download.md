**Publisher's Description**  
  

FUPMON is a freeware server-side file component for Windows Servers which
provides accurate progress information on http file uploads, and gives a
cancellation facility.

FUPMON provides your website with the necessary Javascript to implement file
upload monitoring and cancellation.

FUPMON is very easy to implement - most of the development work required is in
Javascript. It can operate as the file uploader for systems without native
http file upload capabilities (such as Classic ASP).

Needs Windows Server 2000,2003 or 2008 and IIS 5,6 or 7. Works on the client
side with any modern browser and some old ones including IE 5.5,6 and 7.
