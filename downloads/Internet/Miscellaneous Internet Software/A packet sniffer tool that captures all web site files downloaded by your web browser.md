**Publisher's Description**  
  


WebSiteSniffer is a packet sniffer tool that captures all Web site files downloaded by your Web browser while browsing the Internet, and stores them on your hard drive under the base folder that you choose. 

WebSiteSniffer allows you to choose which type of Web site files will be captured: HTML Files, Text Files, XML Files, CSS Files, Video/Audio Files, Images, Scripts, and Flash (.swf) files.

While capturing the Web site files, the main window of WebSiteSniffer displays general statistics about the downloaded files for every Web site / host name, including the total size of all files (compressed and uncompressed) and total number of files for every file type (HTML, Text, Images, and so on).

[Download the 64-Bit version of WebsiteSniffer](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/websitesniffer-x64.zip).

**System Requirements:**

  * This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 7, including 64-bit systems. 
  * One of the following capture drivers is required to use WebSiteSniffer: 
    * [WinPcap Capture Driver](http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm): WinPcap is an open source capture driver that allows you to capture network packets on any version of Windows. You can download and install the [WinPcap driver from this Web page](http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm). 
    * Microsoft Network Monitor Driver version 2.x (Only for Windows 2000/XP/2003): Microsoft provides a free capture driver under Windows 2000/XP/2003 that can be used by WebSiteSniffer, but this driver is not installed by default, and you have to manually install it, by using one of the following options: 
      * Option 1: Install it from the CD-ROM of Windows 2000/XP according to the [instructions in Microsoft Web site](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows2000/en/advanced/help/app_netmon.htm)
      * Option 2 (XP Only) : Download and install the [Windows XP Service Pack 2 Support Tools](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=49ae8576-9bb9-4126-9761-ba8011fabf38&displaylang=en). One of the tools in this package is netcap.exe. When you run this tool in the first time, the Network Monitor Driver will automatically be installed on your system. 
    * Microsoft Network Monitor Driver version 3.x: Microsoft provides a new version of Microsoft Network Monitor driver (3.x) that is also supported under Windows 7/Vista/2008. 
    * The new version of Microsoft Network Monitor (3.x) is available to download from [Microsoft Web site](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=983b941d-06cb-4658-b7f6-3088333d062f&displaylang=en). 
  * You can also try to use WebSiteSniffer without installing any driver, by using the A'Raw SacketsA' method. Unfortunately, Raw Sackets method has many problems: 
    * It doesnA't work in all Windows systems, depending on Windows version, service pack, and the updates installed on your system. 
    * On Windows 7 with UAC turned on, A'Raw SacketsA' method only works when you run WebSiteSniffer with A'Run As AdministratorA'. 

**WhatA's new in version 1.37:**

  * Added 'Sort On Every Update' option.
