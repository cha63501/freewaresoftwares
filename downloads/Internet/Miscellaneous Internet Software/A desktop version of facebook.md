**Publisher's Description**  
  


FBMonitor is a desktop version of Facebook, which has the advantage over the Web version as it needs no browser and does not display ads. 

FBMonitor can inform the user about new statuses by alarm and desktop window with a status. After starting the program, the user logs on and the window displays basic information about the user and their friends. 

If the user chooses to monitor the status it is necessary to check the "Start a service informing about new statuses". This will inform the user about new statuses, the window will be hidden after this action (do not disturb user PC at work) and will be represented only by a systray icon. 

When a user logs in, program automatically allows all permissions for applications of facebook. 

This program uses the official API (application programming interface) from Facebook - Graph API. If you sign up through this program, your status remains as "not connected" in the Web Browser.
