**Publisher's Description**  
  


A handy utility to see all connections on your PC, and close them (or their processes). The program automatically determines the file attached to each process. You can also do a traceroute from the program itself, so you wonA't have to open a command prompt and try to decipher ugly text from Netstat anymore. Must be run in administrator mode in Vista. English and Dutch Windows versions supported (others may work as well).
