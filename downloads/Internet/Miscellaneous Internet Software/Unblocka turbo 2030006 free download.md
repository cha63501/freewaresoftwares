**Publisher's Description**  
  

UnBlocka is a powerful utility that dramatically increases the speed that you
surf the web. UnBlocka is an application that has been designed to increase
bandwidth over high speed high latency internet connections.

UnBlocka will configure your computer to enhance the performance of not only
Internet Explorer and P2P software but all TCP/IP based connections to remote
locations on the internet that traverse modern high speed high latency
international connections. Wireless users regain your lost Internet connection
speed.

UnBlocka will tune the Windows computer to the optimum values based on the
type of internet connection that you have e.g ADSL2+ or Cable. No software is
installed on your computer and your computer can be returned to Microsoft
defaults at any time.

NOTE: the "Tune System" feature does not work on Windows Vista.
