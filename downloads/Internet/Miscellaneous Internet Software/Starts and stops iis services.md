Control Web enables and then starts the IIS, WWW, and FTP services. When you are finish with the services, it will stop the IIS, WWW, and FTP services, then disable them from starting up on the next reboot. 

If you would like to automate the process simply add "-auto" to the shortcut. For example, if the shortcut points to "c:\web.exe" simply change it to say "c:\web.exe -auto". Now when the application will launches, if the services are running it will stop them, if the services are stopped it starts them, then exits the application without user intervention.
