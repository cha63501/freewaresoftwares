**Publisher's Description**  
  

LiveCon! is a simple Windows status tray utility which records and analyzes
the status of a Internet/network connection over a given period of time. The
produced analysis can be used, for example, to determine when connection
difficulties have occurred which, in turn, can be submitted to request credit
compensation (i.e. from an ISP) during an outage.
