**Publisher's Description**  
  

BBCoder was developed for people who write long articles or tutorials for
bulletin boards (forums) without the need of actually being at a bulletin
board or even being online at all for that matter allowing you to get that
article finished.  
  
BBCoder has all the standard tags you would find at most common bulletin
boards, a full list of these of these tags can be found in the BBCoder help
file.  
  
BBCoder will convert the bbcode to html for the preview so you can see exactly
how your article will look when posted. BBCoder also includes a full feathered
tabbed browser with bookmarks making it even easer to keep track of your
favorite forums and post your articles.  
  
With the auto copy feather of BBCoder, when you switch from BBCoder to
BBBrowser your article is automatically copied to the windows clipboard ready
for you to paste at any of the forums.
