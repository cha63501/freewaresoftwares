Given a hypertext transfer protocol URL, this program shows the headers that
the server sends in response to a HEAD request. These headers include valuable
information, such as identification of the remote serverA's software, remote
time and date, the MIME type and size of a file, and various other pieces of
information. Most web browsers today donA't let you see the information that
ViewHEAD returns.
