**Publisher's Description**  
  


SI Trace is a free visual tool for Windows that traces the route of IP packets while they travel from your PC to the remote destination. The tool essentially allows you to see exactly where a connectivity problem is, no matter how far it is from your computer. The last host to respond to traceroute is the last host that is working properly. The first one that fails to respond is the faulty one.
