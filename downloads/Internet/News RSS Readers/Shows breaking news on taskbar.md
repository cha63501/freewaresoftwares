**Publisher's Description**  
  


TaskbarNews reads breaking news from Reuters website and shows the text on the Windows taskbar, without taking the focus from what you are currently doing. A sound alarm indicates the appearance of one or more breaking news stories. Clicking on the text opens the webpage that includes the complete news story. With mouse or keyboard activity, the text disappears in a minute automatically; without activity, breaking news is shown accumulated. User can choose one of the sections: Top News, World, Business, or US/UK Financial News. TaskbarNews is updated to newer versions automatically.
