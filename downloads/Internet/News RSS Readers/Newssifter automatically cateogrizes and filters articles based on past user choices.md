**Publisher's Description**  
  


The problem with RSS news readers is you are flooded to hundreds of stories in a disorganized jumble, you do not even care about 70% of them and you can not even find the ones you do care about. NewsSifter changes all this. NewsSifter learns what you like and how you organize information and presents you with only the stories you find interesting and in a organization that makes sense to you.
