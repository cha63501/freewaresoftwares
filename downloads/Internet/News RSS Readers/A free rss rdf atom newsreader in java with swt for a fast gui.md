**Publisher's Description**  
  


RSSOwl is a free RSS / RDF / Atom Newsreader written in Java using SWT as graphic library. 

RSS ("Really Simple Syndication" or "Rich Site Summary") is a document specification that gives users the power to collect and organize Web-based news and information in a more efficient manner. Applications that collect data from RSS-compliant sites are called RSS readers or "aggregators". RSSOwl is such an application. It lets you gather, organize, update, and store information from any compliant source in a convenient, easy to use interface, save selected information in various formats for offline viewing and sharing, and much more.

Why "Owl"? The owl is a traditional symbol of wisdom, and a quiet, efficient hunter. YouA'll find RSSOwlA's "big eyes" a big help when scanning the WebA's vast array of RSS resources.
