**Publisher's Description**  
  

FastTrackNews is a free prortable RSS feed reader and news aggregator.

The program reduces the time and effort needed to regularly check mass media
websites for updates and can be used as news and blog browser. Once subscribed
to a feed, FastTrackNews is able to check for new content at user-determined
intervals and retrieve the update.

You can easily organize news channels in a fully customizable tree structure
and browse actual news articles using built-in or external webbrowser.

FastTrackNews uses a web feed to retrieve syndicated news given in XML-based
formats (Atom, RSS, etc.), rapidly downloads news articles from various web
sources in background and displays them in comfortable customizable views.

The program supports password protected feeds, has the ability to expire news
items so they get deleted after a certain amount of days. The RSS content is
sometimes described as being "pulled" to the subscriber, as opposed to
"pushed" with mailing list or Internet Messaging. Unlike recipients of some
"pushed" information, the RSS Reader user can easily unsubscribe from a feed.

FastTrackNews is simple and easy to use, offers a no-nonsense Outlook Express-
like user interface. With FastTrackNews you will be keep informed about the
most recent news.

The program is free, does not require installation, occupies far less space on
HD/RAM than other similar paid programs, does not contain any annoying ad
banners.
