**Publisher's Description**  
  

GrabIt is one of the easiest binary Usenet downloaders in the world. With
GrabIt you can search and download MP3 files, pictures, movies, software,
games and more on USENET news servers, without downloading gigabytes if
headers.

The program features NZB file support, automatic batch downloading of multiple
binaries at once, advanced error checking, filter options, multiple server
support and more. You can also choose to save the downloaded files with a
custom prefix and resume broken downloads. It can even shut down your computer
for you when all downloads are completed. All features are controlled from an
easy and intuitive interface.
