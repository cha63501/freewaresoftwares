Whether you understand RSS to stand for Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication, there are high chances that you subscribe to some RSS feeds. They make it easy to get the latest information from your preferred websites without opening the sites, as all you need is an RSS reader that aggregates content from various sites. However, what do you do if you want to create or edit RSS feeds instead? You need a good RSS editor like RSSme. This is an intuitive application that makes it easy to create RSS content. 

**Main Features**

  * User-friendly visual editor 
  * Supports plain HTML tags 
  * Supports on-the-fly preview of HTML code 
  * Easy insertion of images 
  * Easy management of posts 
  * Fast validation of RSS feeds 

**Using RSSme**

Since RSSme is a portable application, we copied it on a flash drive so we could use it on multiple computers.

The editing pane allowed us to enter the content we wanted in Rich Text format to make it more aesthetically appealing and readable. For example, we had the option to use bold letters in some places and italics in other places.

In addition to the body of our posts, we could provide all other relevant components, including titles, headings, categories, links and names of authors. The editor allowed us to copy, cut, paste or delete content. Although the application functions on AWhat You See is What You GetA basis, it allowed us to copy the underlying HTML code. The WYSIWYG mode makes it easy for anyone to insert images in RSS posts.

RSSme also makes it easy to manage RSS feeds. For example, you can sort feeds by their creation dates, titles or positions. You will find it easy to order items in your list as you want. You can save your details in XML format or print them.

The application works fast, and the ability to use hotkeys makes it even easier to control.

**Summary**

RSSme is an intuitive RSS editor that anyone with basic computer skills can use. The WYSIWYG mode lets users see exactly how their content will appear without worrying about the underlying HTML code. They can quickly validate their feeds on the official W3C website. The applicationAs portability means that it does not make any changes to Windows Registry. It is fast and uses low system resources.
