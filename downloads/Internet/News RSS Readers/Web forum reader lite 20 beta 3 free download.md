A program for reading Internet forums. Add your favorite forums to Web Forum
Reader, then see recent changes on these forums with just a few clicks. Read
the most interesting topics without loading them into a browser that results
in saving your traffic.

Web Forum Reader saves time by showing only new and updated topics. Use Web
Forum ReaderA's handy resource addition wizard to add Internet forums and
conference to the program.

**Note:** The lite version does not allow users to search the forums.

**What's New in version 2.0 Beta 3:**

  * The new "Relearn Resource" command has been added to the context and main menu. It allows to set the new data extraction settings for the resources which are already added to Web Forum Reader. 
  * The context and main menus has been optimized: commands that are not available at the moment are no longer displayed.
