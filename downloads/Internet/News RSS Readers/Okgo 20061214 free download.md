**Publisher's Description**  
  

Okgo is the result of an effort to have a desktop software to read RSS feeds
from online social event calendars and provide a consolidated view. It started
out as an effort to get a consolidated view of events happening in one city.

The events happening around us and the lack of a tool to collectively gather
and present this information in a better way gave an opportunity to bind
existing technologies together to create okgo.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
