**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pheedstorm enables you to subscribe to all your favorite feeds, but rather than simply notifying you about all new articles, it analyses each one to try and work out whether you will find it interesting or not. If the article reaches a particular "relevance factor" it will be shown, otherwise it will not bother you. 

It does this by using feedback that you provide it to let it know how relevant you find particular articles on a scale of -10 to +10, for example if you are fairly interested in articles about the economy and interest rates and an article about this appears, you could mark it as +5. If the article also mentions your home town you might want to mark it +8. If however an article appears about something you are completely disinterested in, give it a negative rating. Over time, the program learns about the kind of articles you like and shows similar articles when they are published on your feeds.

You can also use it as a "standard" RSS reader, and have it show you all new articles on a feed. You can also set up specific keyword alerts, e.g. show all articles with the word "IRAQ" even if they donA't meet the relevance normally required.
