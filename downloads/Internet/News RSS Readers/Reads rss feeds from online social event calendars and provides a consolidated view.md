**Publisher's Description**  
  


Okgo is the result of an effort to have a desktop software to read RSS feeds from online social event calendars and provide a consolidated view. It started out as an effort to get a consolidated view of events happening in one city. 

The events happening around us and the lack of a tool to collectively gather and present this information in a better way gave an opportunity to bind existing technologies together to create okgo.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
