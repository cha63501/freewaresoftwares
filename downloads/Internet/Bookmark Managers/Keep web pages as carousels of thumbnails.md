**Publisher's Description**  
  


A powerful internet browsing utility that enables you to keep track of pages you have visited and may wish to visit again. Its patented iCarousels information display system keeps the collections of pages that you create highly visible and easy to access. 

Very often we give up on collecting information, especially from the internet, because we either end up with huge lists or if we try to organise it most of it will get buried in a sub-directory somewhere never to be seen again. iCarousels - Visual Web solves this problem by:

Allowing completely stand alone named collections. Why mix up your collection of interesting pages on pet care with the pages you have collected while researching which car to buy next.

Displaying thumbnail images of collected pages arranged as carousels which can be spun quickly so you can get a quick glimpse of each page.

Providing a unique open view of directory or folder structures so that information buried in sub-directories or sub-folders can still be seen.

With this ability to visualise what you have collected it becomes practical to keep detailed collections of interesting pages (including whole web-sites) on every theme or topic that interests you.

  * Toolbar for Internet Explorer to provide single click bookmarking as you browse.
