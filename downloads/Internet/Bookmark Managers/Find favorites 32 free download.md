**Publisher's Description**  
  

Find Favorites allows you to quickly find a link in the sometimes confusing
folder which Internet Explorer keeps its bookmarks (URL files). Just type a
word on the find edit box and Find Favorites will quickly display any matching
links (searching the contents of the file by name, address and folder).

Find Favorites will reside on the system tray, near the clock for easy access.
