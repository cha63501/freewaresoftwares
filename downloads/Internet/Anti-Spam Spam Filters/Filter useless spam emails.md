**Publisher's Description**  
  


Spamihilator works between your E-Mail client and the Internet and examines every incoming E-Mail. Useless spam mails (Junk) will be filtered out. This process runs completely in the background. 

The new Learning Filter (Bayesian Filter) uses the rules of Thomas Bayes (English mathematician, 18th century) and calculates a certain Spam-Probability for every E-Mail. You can train this filter! So it will know your messages even better than you. Hence the recognition rate will continuously increase.

In addition Spamihilator uses a Word-Filter, that searches messages for known keywords.

Of course, Spamihilator supports [Plugins](http://www.spamihilator.com/plugins/index.php). These useful additional filters protect your system against annoying spam mails.

The program works with almost every E-Mail client, such as Outlook/Outlook Express, Eudora, Mozilla, Netscape, IncrediMail, Pegasus Mail, Phoenix Mail, Opera, etc...
