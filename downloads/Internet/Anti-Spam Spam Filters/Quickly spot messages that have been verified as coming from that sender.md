**Publisher's Description**  
  


Iconix eMail ID is a useful mail utility that uses industry standard technologies to verify the authenticity of the message when an email arrives. We use technologies like Domain Keys and Sender ID which are backed by companies such as Cisco, Microsoft and Yahoo! 

The email sender is checked against a list of registered senders with ICONIX, Inc. Once an email has passed Authentication and Identification steps, a Truemark icon is displayed in your inbox.
