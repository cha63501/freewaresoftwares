A free tool to download files in batches from http server. It is pure RFC
implementation. Feel free to use. Save links and once list is ready download

THIS IS A BATCH DOWNLOAD UTILITY TO FETCH SMALL FILES FROM HTTP SERVERS.

Add items to the download list by any option.

  * Drop links from your web page to download list pane. Repeat for all the desired links of data files. 
  * If you have a text file listing the file urls (one per line) load them by menu command. 
  * If you have link(s) in clipboard then use the paste shortcut to list them in download list. 
  * Provide a web page address and it will parse all the links and fill them to appropriate task list. 
  * Search google without browser and get the links. 
Downloading files is easy just press the arrow button on toolbar. All the
batched files will be downloaded in either base folder or auto generated
folder hierarchy or wherever you choose to. This option is provided in control

which is not downloaded and on menu click A'Block ..A'. This will stop
downloads onwards this item.

You can remove the downloaded items from list and save the remaining items for
next batch download. So that ultimately you can download all the files.
