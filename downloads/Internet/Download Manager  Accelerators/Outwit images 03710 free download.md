OutWit Images allows users to quickly navigate through many Web pages and
harvest unlimited numbers of images. It is a free Firefox 3 add-on compatible

OutWit Images distinguishes itself by being one of the only image browsers
that allows users to save images directly onto their hard disk. Users can

a button. Its sleek, easy-to-use interface displays thumbnails on a black
background and allows users to smoothly scroll through the images. The
appearance of the application can be personalized by selecting different
background colors and views for the thumbnails.

The images can be dragged and dropped into the collection basket, the "catch,A
where they can be saved directly onto the computer, displayed in a slideshow,
or shared with other users. It also offers a variety of other options
including filters for viewing and saving the images, as well as, visible
source information. It is the first application of its kind specifically
designed for the collection of images to be released to the general public,
for either professional or personal use.
