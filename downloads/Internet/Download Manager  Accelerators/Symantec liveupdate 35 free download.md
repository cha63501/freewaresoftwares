**Publisher's Description**  
  

LiveUpdate is the Symantec technology that permits an installed Symantec
product to connect to a Symantec server over the Internet to check for program
and other updates such as virus definitions and URL lists. When updates are
available, it downloads them to your computer and installs them, keeping your
Symantec software up to date. All updates that are downloaded are checked for
a valid digital signature.
