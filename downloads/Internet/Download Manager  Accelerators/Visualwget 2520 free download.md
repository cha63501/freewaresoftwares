**Publisher's Description**  
  

VisualWget is a download manager that uses Wget as its core. It give you an
interface to manage your downloads. By maintaining your downloads as a list of
jobs, you can easily see the progress of them as they are running; start or
stop them; or set their priority. Each download (job) can be configured
separately. When you create a new job or edit an existing one, you can insert
a list of URLs and select from various WgetA's options.

You can give VisualWget a new look by making skins. Things like main
application icon, system tray icon, bullet images, toolbar images, menus and
context menus images are called skins. So you can use you own icon as a system
tray icon or use your own image on a toolbar button.
