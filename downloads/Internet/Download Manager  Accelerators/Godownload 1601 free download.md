**Publisher's Description**  
  

GoDownload is a download manager that makes it easier to download large files.

It works in the background splitting the files in many segments that work
separately one from each other, only at the end of the download they are
joined. It is compatible with the most common browsers, like Internet
Explorer, Netscape, Opera and FireFox intercepting the click on the link,
however it is possible to import the link by dragging it directly in the list
of GoDonwload and the program will automatically accept it.

The program allows you to have a detailed recapitulation of the download, with
all the communications that it had with the server and a report of the various
segments, where the file is broken, and the state of the download. It has a
simple to use interface to use and a nice graphic. Works on all the Windows
Operating Systems.
