**Publisher's Description**  
  

HTTrack is a free (open source) and easy-to-use offline browser utility.

It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local
directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and
other files from the server to your computer.

HTTrack arranges the original siteA's relative link-structure. Simply open a
page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the site
from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update
an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully
configurable, and has an integrated help system.
