**Publisher's Description**  
  


Download Commander is a program which allows you to download files from the internet by using the http protocol. It is possible to download only one file, but the strength of the program lies in the fact that it enables the user to select more than one file to download from a single internet page. The files are queued and downloaded one after the other. 

**Increase download speed**  
Download Commander downloads the file(s) using multiple threads. Internet Explorer or other internet browsers downloads files using only one thread. This does not take advantage of the large bandwidths we have today. Downloading with multiple threads increases the download speed significantly.

**Internet Explorer**  
Download Commander is integrated in Internet Explorer. It is possible to start downloading files from the current internet page, or just select one file to download. Downloading is done by using the context menu (right-mouse click) on the current internet page.

**Credentials**  
These days a lot of sites require you to enter credentials before you can access them. Download Commander letA's you maintain these credentials and uses them when needed automatically.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx).
