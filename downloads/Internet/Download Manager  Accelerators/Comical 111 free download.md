**Publisher's Description**  
  

Comical is a comic downloader and viewer that utilizes a custom-built
framework for the parsing and downloading of comics from websites. The
framework uses an open XML format that allows anyone to add support for
additional comics.

There is full support for comic archiving and browsing. If archiving is
enabled (within the Settings window), Comical will archive any downloaded
comics; these comics can then be browsed as required via the navigation
buttons located in the top-right of the main application window.

The original version of Comical was merely a testing harness used for creating
the framework that powered the main web-comic download and parsing
functionality; version 0.90 Alpha has since had its interface completely
rewritten to be more user-friendly and will continue to be improved upon in
future updates.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html).
