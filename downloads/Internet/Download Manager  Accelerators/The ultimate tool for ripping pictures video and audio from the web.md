**Publisher's Description**  
  


WebRipper is a free Internet scanner and downloader, which is easy to use, yet powerful and fast. 

Download massive amounts of images, videos, audio, executables or documents from any website in just a moment. No need to waste your time clicking the links and saving every file manually.

WebRipper uses spider-technology to follow the links in all directions from the start-address. It filters out the interesting files on the way, and adds them to the download-queue for fast downloading by the multi channel download-engine. 

Numerous filter-options ensure that downloaded files suit your needs perfectly. Restrict downloaded items by file type, minimum and maximum file- and image-size. Spidered and dowloaded links can also be restricted by keywords to avoid wasting your bandwidth.

WebRipper is integrated with major Internet search engines, giving you the ability to specify just a search word/phrase and category, and then let the program do the rest of the job. The result is loads of files "tailored" to your needs. 

Password protected sites can of course also be ripped by specifying a username and password. Connection through proxy-server is possible.

The integrated image viewer allows you to browse the downloaded images, or preview them at the moment they are fetched.
