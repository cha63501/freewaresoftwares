  * Capability to split download into several sections allows you to increase download speed up to 600%. 
  * FDM can connect to the Internet at a set time, download the files you want, launch any program, disconnect or shut down your computer when it's done. 
  * This download manager allows you to specify the settings of network usage, such as login and password, maximum number of connections, default group, etc. So you can avoid adjusting these settings every time you need to create new download from the server. 
  * Also you can download the whole web sites from the remote server. You can adjust FDM to download files with the extensions you have specified.
