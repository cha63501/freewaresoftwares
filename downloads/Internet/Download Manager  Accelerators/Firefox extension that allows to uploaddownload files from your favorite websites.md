**Publisher's Description**  
  


This extension allows to upload/download files from your favorite websites using a simple interface. 

Here is list of all sites supported by Fireuploader:

  * Box.net 
  * Flickr 
  * Picasa 
  * Facebook 
  * Webshots

  * SmeStorage 
  * Google Docs 
  * Snaphappi (new), a digital photo processing website 
  * Adobe Share (new) 
  * Slideshare (new) (Share your presentations online) 

There are so many instances where you had to upload files from your local computer to a website. The standard upload mechanism in any website has many limitations like:

  * They allow you to upload 1 file or a maximum of 10 files at a time. 
  * They doesnA't show any information like upload progress i.e how much was already uploaded and how much is still remaining. 

This extension addresses these limitations by providing a intuitive way to upload the files. The benefits of using this extension are: 

  * It shows the local folders and remote folders which enables you to upload files by single click. 
  * You can upload any number of files at a time. 
  * You can upload files to multiple websites using a single interface (using only one extension). 
  * Ability to add multiple accounts and upload files to each account independently. 
  * Site specific features are also included and will be improved in the coming versions. eg. Box.net: giving public/private access to files. 
Works with: Firefox: 3.0 A 3.0.* 

**WhatA's New in version 0.3.8:**

The new version includes Thumbnail View of files/folders/photos on the local system (left panel). You can enable it by clicking on the thumbnail icon.

In this version, Snaphappi (a digital photo processing website), Slideshare.net (Share your presentations) and Adobe Share has been added. You can make PDF documents using Adobe Share. Upload any word/image document, download it in PDF format.
