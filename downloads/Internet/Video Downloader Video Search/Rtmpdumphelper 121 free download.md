**Publisher's Description**  
  

RTMPDumpHelper is a small utility that can help you to easily download RTMP
video/audio streams. By combining this utility and the proxy server of
[RTMPDump toolkit](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/), you can simply open a Web
page containing RTMP video stream in your favorite Web browser, and while
watching the video, itA'll be saved to your disk automatically as .flv or .mp4
file.

RTMP is a streaming protocol used by Hulu, justin.tv, and by many live
streaming Web sites.

**System Requirements:**

  * This utility cannot download RTMP streams by itself. You have to download the [RTMPDump toolkit](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/) separately from [http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu Web site](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu) and put it in the same folder that you extracted the files of RTMPDumpHelper. 
  * All versions of Windows are supported, starting from Windows XP and up to Windows 8. You can also use this tool on x64 systems, but the Web browser itself must be a 32-bit application. In the future, IA'll probably release x64 version of RTMPDumpHelper to work with 64-bit Web browsers. 
  * Web Browser - Generally, RTMPDumpHelper should be able to work with all Web browsers. If you use a portable Web browser (without installation), you have to manually add it to the Web browsers list, by using the A'Add Support For Web BrowserA' option (F8). 

**WhatA's New in version 1.21:**

  * Added 'Scroll Down On New Line' option.
