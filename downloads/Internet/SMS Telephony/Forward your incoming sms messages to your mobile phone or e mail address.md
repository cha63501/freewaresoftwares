**Publisher's Description**  
  


Using SMS2Email you can forward your incoming SMS messages to your mobile phone or to a specified e-mail address. You can also send SMS messages from your e-mail client (Outlook, Thunderbird or even web-based) directly to a mobile phone. 

**Requirements:**

We can easily divide this application into two important features. 1 - SMS to E-Mail and 2- E-Mail to SMS. For the first part a GPRS-enabled smartdevice that runs Windows Mobile 5 or Windows CE 5 (.NET Compact Framework 2) is needed. For the second part a computer connected to the internet with a direct ip address (not behind a server - in this case you will have to forward some ports to your local ip address) is needed. ActiveSync 4.x is also required. 

**Usage:**

First you need to install .NET Compact Framework 2.0 if it isnA't already installed on your smartdevice. You can download it from **[here**](http://206.217.205.73/~dlfreeht/files/NETCFv2.wm.armv4i.cab). Otherwise you wil receive an error message.
