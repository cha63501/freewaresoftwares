**Publisher's Description**  
  


Voip PC phone does not rely on third-party vendors or special internet websites to make calls. It is perfect for LAN networks. 

All you need is a headset and microphone to make a call. Voip PC Phone works only on LAN, DSL, Cable, or 3 / 4G broadband connections. The minimum bandwidth required is 64 Kbps (continuous).

**How it works:**

For LAN and Wi-Fi connections, simply enter the I.P. address or Host name you want to call and click on the "Chat" button. When the ringtone goes off, just answer your call and start chatting.

For Internet Calls: Before making a call, press the refresh button to make sure of your I.P. Address. When making a call over a DSL, Cable, or 3 / 4G connection, connect first and then run the application to ensure a correct return I.P. Address. On a LAN connection the I.P. Address is your network card address. On a DSL, Cable, or 3 / 4G connection, the I.P. Address is the address your I.S.P. provides automatically when you connect.

If you are behind a router, take a look at our tutorial on Video setup for best results. You will need to enter setup information to do Port forwarding on your router. To make a quick connection to a friend or family member over the internet, simply sms your current I.P. address to whom ever you need to contact while you are online. They in turn enter your I.P. address in the address box and click on the chat button to start the connection. 

Answer the call and start chatting.
