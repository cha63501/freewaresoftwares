**Publisher's Description**  
  

GoText is a simple and easy to use text messaging application that allows you
to send SMS text messages from your PC to your friendA's phone. It is easier
and faster than using your phone, and it could even save you a buck or two in
messaging charges. It is the perfect solution for when you are sitting around
the dorm room or the apartment and have quick access to a PC.

When you send messages, your friend can reply to your phone number or an email
address (if their carrier supports it) just as if you had sent the message
from your phone. Features include: Address Book, Recent Numbers Lists, Auto
Message Splitting of long messages, Multiple Recipient Support, Command Line
Support, Adress Book Import, and more.
