A gsm utility that will call you according to sounds which a predefined threshold. 

Whereever you are, Babyphone can contact you, as long as you have connectivity to a GSM-Network. And the best is: You have no costs because you donA't have to accept the call. This software is available in German and English.

The mainscreen of Babyphone shows you the current status, the settings for microphone and the gauges. Furthermore, the mainscreen shows the thresholds with which you can define in the settings.

In the configuration menu you must define a valid call number. A call delay value ( minutes ) is available for waiting a minimum time between single calls. Also you have a maximum parameter of calls for protecting you against false alarms.

In the second configuration dialog you can define the microfons sensibility and the thresholds for reaction. If the microphones gauge reach the right threshold, a phone call is performed.
