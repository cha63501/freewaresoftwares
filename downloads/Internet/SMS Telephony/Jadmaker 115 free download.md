**Publisher's Description**  
  

JADMaker creates a JAD file for your .JAR Java Games, so that you can install
them to your mobile phone.

How to use this program?

There are 3 ways.

  1. Run JADMaker. Drag and drop a JAR file onto the window. JAD generated. ThatA's it! 
  2. Drag and drop a JAR file onto the JADMaker.exe icon in a Windows Explorer window. This means you can also create a desktop shortcut to JADMaker.exe, and then drop JAR file(s) onto the shortcut. 
  3. Once the "Make JAD" Explorer Context-Menu extension is enabled (by checking it in the program), you can right click on any JAR file(s) for a quick "Make JAD". 

Remember that you can process multiple JAR files at one time (=batch
procesing). Just select multiple files, and use any of the ways above (this is
really the icing on the cake!).

No special installation is required on Windows. JADMaker can be put in any
folder (together with other required files).
