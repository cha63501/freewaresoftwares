**Publisher's Description**  
  


BluetoothView is a small utility that runs in the background, and monitors the activity of Bluetooth devices around you. For each detected Bluetooth device, it displays the following information: Device Name, Bluetooth Address, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, First Detection Time, Last Detection Time, and more. 

BluetoothView can also notify you when a new Bluetooth device is detected, by displaying a balloon in your taskbar or by playing a small beep sound.

BluetoothView doesnA't require any installation process or additional DLL files. In order to start using it, simply copy the executable file (BluetoothView.exe) to any folder you like, and run it. A few seconds after you run it, BluetoothView will start to gradually display all detected Bluetooth around you. 

**System Requirements:**

  * Bluetooth Dongle 
  * Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista. Other versions of Windows donA't provide a build-in support for Bluetooth, and thus BluetoothView cannot work with them. 

**WhatA's new in version 1.66:**

  * Added 'Mark Odd/Even Rows' option, under the View menu. When it's turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to make it easier to read a single line. 
  * Added 'Auto Size Columns+Headers' option, which allows you to automatically resize the columns according to the row values and column headers.
