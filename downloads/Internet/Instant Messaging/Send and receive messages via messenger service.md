**Publisher's Description**  
  


Most everyone knows the "NET SEND" command in WindowsNT, which sends messages through Windows Messenger Service. This software is based on it. It is convenient because the receiverA's computer doesnA't need any software if they have Windows NT, 2000, or XP installed. But if the receiver only has Windows 9x installed or has the net firewall on, he cannot receive the message. 

freeTalk is the very program that uses this method to send and receive messages. It can remember your friends IP and save the history of sent and received messages.You can use it just like you are using ICQ.
