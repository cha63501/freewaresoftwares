**Publisher's Description**  
  

Today, Roepersoft announced the release of IMCourier, the free service that
lets AIM and ICQ users check their IMs from anywhere in the world. Six months
in the making, the new version 2.0 release carries no adware or other bundles,
and has greatly improved upon its already groundbreaking functionality. V2.0
features an all-new application core that gaurentees constant connection and
steady posting of IMA's to the IMCourier server, making the connectivity
issues in V1.0 a thing of the past.

Version 2.0 is so lightweight and compact that it runs on almost any PC with a
Windows operating system. Precise resource usage calculations allows V2.0 to
post a userA's messages to the server on as low as a 14.4k modem, all the
while using only 16MB of memory.

The brand new website and user panel were designed with portability in mind.
So long as the IMCourier software is installed on the PC you regularly use
instant messaging on, your IMs can be read from just about any browser you
come across, including PDAs and an expanding array of mobile devices, to
include T-Mobile Sidekicks.. The improved panel boasts high-level encryption,
as well a redesigned, sleek look and feel that brings the user complete
privacy and protection. IMCourier melds the global availability of e-mail with
the real-time convenience of instant messaging.
