**Publisher's Description**  
  


This application allows you to send an instant global popup message to all PCA's on the internal network that you install the included agent on. Unlike a lot of similar applications, this does not use the Windows Messenger service so will work on Windows XP and 7. It will also display the popup message on all PCA's no matter which subnet they are on. 

This requires a server or PC shared folder to be available. Comes with full instructions, but may need a little technical experience.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
