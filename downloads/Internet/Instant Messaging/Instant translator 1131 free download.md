**Publisher's Description**  
  

Instant Translator is a new experimental activity for MSN Messenger 6.0 (and
later) and Windows Live Messenger which allows on-the-fly translation of all
incoming messages. This may come handy when you have to chat with people on
the Internet who donA't speak the same language(s) as you do. You wonA't have
to copy and paste text from a computer-aided translation website anymore.

This applet is based on the Messenger Activity SDK and uses AltavistaA's Babel
Fish Translation website for the translation.

The installer simply copies a small configuration file to the Messenger
folder. To start the activity, close any currently opened conversation and
reopen it to take changes into effect, then click the Actions > Start Instant
Translator menu.

Note: since this activity uses an ActiveX control (Microsoft XMLHTTP) and
requires access to an external website (Altavista) you may receive a security
warning upon the reception of the first message. See the readme.txt file in
the zip for more information.
