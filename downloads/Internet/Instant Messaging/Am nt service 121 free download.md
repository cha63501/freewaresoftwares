**Publisher's Description**  
  

Alternate option to AM Server.

This is NT Service for Private IM Network AM. This is first release of NT
Service which can replace AM Server 1.2.0 or higher. This NT Service version
is more stable and independent from user login / logout. If you are using AM
Server 1.2.0 or higher on NT system then try this new NT Service version. The
major advantage is remote administration of AM NT Service.

It has been tested on 2000 / Windows XP / Vista Home Premium and should work
on all Vista versions. On vista you need administrative rights to operate the
service manager properly. This service is not supported on Win 98 / Me, but
can be run manually for the sole advantage of remote administration.

**Features**

  * NT Service is 100% alternate option for AM Server 1.2.0 or later. 
  * It will run as service in background and is not influenced by user login / logouts. 
  * Remote management with Service Manager. 
  * Service manager GUI is better than AM Server GUI. 
  * Service can be stopped / started from service manager.
