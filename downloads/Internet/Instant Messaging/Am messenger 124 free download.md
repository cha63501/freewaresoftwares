AM Messenger is built on AM chat protocol rules. Free AM chat server is also
available for download. This version includes groups, archives, spell
check(dictionary included in this install). It also supports conference,
multiple status for contacts, html / rtf message mode, file transfer,
calculator, word help, emoticon etc. All message transfer is in encrypted
format. Apart from the default encryption you can set second level encryption.

Intellisense support for auto complete is also new addition. To use spell-
check, Intellisense. Now dictionary is part of install system despite this
setup file is 25% smaller. Thanks to the NSIS installer it made my job easy by
providing superb compression.
