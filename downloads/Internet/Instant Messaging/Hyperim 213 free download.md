**Publisher's Description**  
  

HyperIM is a useful software which has two main functions: status manager &
answering robot, for use with Yahoo! Messenger. The status message is
customizable and can contain many details: current date/time, song info
(title, bitrate, sample rate, duration, ASCII progress bar of the playback,
playlist position, playlist length) of the currently playing media. It
supports Winamp, BSplayer and foobar2000 (in order of retrievable infos).
Statuses can be saved and reused.

Also, an answering robot can automatically reply to messages received. Answers
can be saved, and customized to each user ID. You can define distinct answers
for those who BUZZ you and even send them random funny antiBuzz messages
(those can also be edited in file buzzOff.txt), and even choose to close those
conversation windows. Your answers can contain dynamic info about what you are
listening/viewing, cuurent date/time, and such.

The program is based on the use of 23 text macros that are replaced inline
when they have to output. there are about 10 macros for media player infos, 4
for date and time, another 4 for use with a countdown timer, and one which can
be randomly/orderly changed from time to time from a list in a chosen text
file.

  * change your status instantly in all your desired IM clients - most popular IM programs supported! 
  * show what you listen or what movie you watch - many media players supported (!!!)
