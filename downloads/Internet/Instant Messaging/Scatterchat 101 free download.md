**Publisher's Description**  
  

ScatterChat is a HACKTIVIST WEAPON designed to allow non-technical human
rights activists and political dissidents to communicate securely and
anonymously while operating in hostile territory. It is also useful in
corporate settings, or in other situations where privacy is desired.

It is a secure instant messaging client (based upon the Gaim software) that
provides end-to-end encryption, integrated onion-routing with Tor, secure file
transfers, and easy-to-read documentation.

Its security features include resiliency against partial compromise through
perfect forward secrecy, immunity from replay attacks, and limited resistance
to traffic analysis... all reinforced through a pro-actively secure design.
