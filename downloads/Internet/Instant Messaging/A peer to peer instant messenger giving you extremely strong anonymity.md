**Publisher's Description**  
  


TorChat is a peer to peer instant messenger with a completely decentralized design, built on top of TorA's location hidden services, giving you extremely strong anonymity while being very easy to use without the need to install or configure anything. 

TorChat just runs from any USB drive on any Windows PC. 

Tor location hidden services basically means:

  * Nobody will be able to find out where you are. 
  * If they are already observing you and sniff your internet connection they will not be able to find out 
    * what you send or receive (everything is end-to-end encrypted) 
    * to whom you are sending or receiving from 
    * where your contacts are located 
The Tor binary which is bundled with TorChat is taken from the official Tor installer. You can binary compare the tor.exe with the official one to verify this or replace it with your own version of tor.exe if you like.
