The Messenger Backup Wizard is a small tool that lets users create a backup of
their Messenger content like _Emoticons_ and _Display Pictures_. All you need
to do is enter your email address and it will create a backup of your graphics
automatically.

Losing all your emoticons or avatars can be very annoying, but you can always
restore your favorite emoticon or picture if you have a backup. So be sure to
backup your smileys regularly with this free wizard. The Backup Wizard works
with all versions of MSN and Live Messenger.

Works with Messenger 6, 7, and Windows Live Messenger 8.
