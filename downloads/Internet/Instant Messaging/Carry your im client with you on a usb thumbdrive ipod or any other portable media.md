**Publisher's Description**  
  


Portable Gaim allows you to carry your instant messaging client with you on a USB thumbdrive, iPod, portable hard drive or any other portable media. You can plug it right into any Windows computer and use it just like you would on your own. 

Portable Gaim is the repackaged version of the popular Gaim Instant Messenger client designed with portability in mind, so it has all the same great features of Gaim -- including support for AOL/ICQ, IRC, Jabber, MSN, Yahoo and more -- but thereA's nothing to install.
