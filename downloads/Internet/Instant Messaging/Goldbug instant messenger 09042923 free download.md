**Publisher's Description**  
  

GoldBug is a secure Instant Messenger. You can be sure with using GoldBug
(GB), that no third party can look into your chat communication. Private user-
to-user communication remains private.

GoldBug (short: GB or GBIM) therefore uses strong multi-encryption with
different layers of modern encryption technologies. It offers as well
decentral and encrypted Email and decentral public E*IRC-Chat.

**WhatA's New in version 0.9.04.2923:**

  * Updated OpenSSL library to latest. GB had no heartbleed, as the lib was already the latest and not affected. 
  * Improved, more simplified Gui, which is default at startup. 
  * Added e-mail C/O institutions: Institutions will now be able to house 3rd-party e-mail without needing to distribute their public keys. (Please remove your old email.db.) With enabling C/O service you create a post office for your friends. Two methods exist: Define a common neighbor (e.g Alice and Bob connect to a common webserver as node, and all three have email keys shared), then the webserver stores the emails, even if Alice or Bob are offline. Second: Create an Institution and add the email key of a friend to your node. In case your friend adds the magnet link for the institution as well to his node, the institution will save all emails for him (as well from senders, which are not registered at the virtual institution). A Magnet Link allows to share the Institution easily. 
  * SCTP implementation and support for Windows. 
  * Public keys of other participants will now be encrypted. Please remove friends_public_keys.db. 
  * Corrected a Bug in Rosetta CryptoPad Decryption.
