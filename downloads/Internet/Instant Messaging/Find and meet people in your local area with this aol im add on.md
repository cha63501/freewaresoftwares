**Publisher's Description**  
  


IMLocal is an add-on enhancer for AOL Instant Messenger with two unique features. It automatically integrates an orange button into titlebar of the buddylist window. For meeting new people it provides easy access to buddies in your local area. For having fun and staying in the loop with existing friends it provides a BuddyPost function that enables users to share images and messages with each other. These posts are shown in rotation within the space AIM normally uses for advertisements. It uses an encrypted protocol for your protection, does not contain adware, spyware, or malware of any type, and will never disclose any of your information to a 3rd party.
