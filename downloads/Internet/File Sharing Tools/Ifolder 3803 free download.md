**Publisher's Description**  
  

iFolder is a simple and secure storage solution that can increase your
productivity by enabling you to back up, access and manage your personal
files-from anywhere, at any time. Once you have installed iFolder, you simply
save your files locally-as you have always done-and iFolder automatically
updates the files on a network server and delivers them to the other machines
you use.

Sponsored by Novell, the iFolder project is built on the Mono/.Net framework
to integrate seamlessly into existing desktop environments.
