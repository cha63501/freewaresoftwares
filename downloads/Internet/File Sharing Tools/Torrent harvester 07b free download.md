**Publisher's Description**  
  

Torrent Harvester is a free and useful software that will perform a search for
Torrents on multiple websites returning all results in a single list. Just
enter some text to search on, press enter or click the search button and the
list will fill with torrents found. Right clicking a torrent in the list will
bring up a menu to download the torrent and start your BitTorrent client.

Torrent Harvester eliminates the need to use your web browser to check many
Torrent sites if you are looking for a particular torrent. This means annoying
pop-ups, advertising, spyware and virus threats are eliminated. Torrent
Harvester is also flexible enough to allow for the addition of new search
engines, and alteration of existing engines in the case of site redesign.
