**Publisher's Description**  
  


Using P2P file sharing software such as LimeWire, uTorrent, Azureus Vuze, BitTorrent, FrostWire, eMule, or Ares to share free music, movies, or software can expose you to lawsuits by copyright holders and identity theft. P2P software automatically shares files you download with other P2P users, and copyright holders routinely file lawsuits against these people. 

ZapShares works in conjunction with any P2P file sharing software you currently use and solves this problem by creating a secure vault, which automatically stops files you download using P2P file sharing software from being shared with other P2P users. This allows you to continue downloading any files you want while protecting you against expensive lawsuits. 

ZapShares also protects you against identity theft by alerting you about any sensitive files you are accidentally sharing with other P2P users, such as your tax returns, bank account details, and other private information.
