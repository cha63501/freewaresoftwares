**Publisher's Description**  
  

PeerBlock lets you control who your computer "talks to" on the Internet.

By selecting appropriate lists of "known bad" computers, you can block
communication with advertising or spyware oriented servers, computers
monitoring your p2p activities, computers which have been "hacked", even
entire countries!

They canA't get in to your computer, and your computer wonA't try to send them
anything either.
