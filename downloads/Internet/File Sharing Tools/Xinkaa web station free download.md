An http server, sharing any type of files (picture, mp3, movie...). By making
an http hyper link for any of your files, you can share your file from your
local disk, cd-rom, dvd-rom, network drive. By copying your sharing file into
a ShareFolder, your unshared files have been protected.

A Web page viewer letA's you preview your Web pages before sharing with your
friends. You can use the Web page editer to create and edit your Web pages in
"what you see is what you get" view. You can create one Web page to enable
multiple file downloading.

from your personal PC is difficult. You donA't have a Web domain name. To
reminber your IP address is difficult. This program enables you to send your
whole Web page to your friend by email. So you donA't need to tell them your
IP address again and again.

Dynamic IP mapping solution. After signup as a member in xinkaa.com, you can
create a xinkaa.com subdomain. Use the subdomain not the IP address when you
send the hyper link to your friends. So your friends always get your new IP
address when they visit your site.
