**Publisher's Description**  
  


BitHost is a multitasking file sharing software resurrecting the best features of the former popular BitTorrent client, Shareaza within its own framework. Given its multi-network support, the program provides users with access to millions of songs, movies, games and videos. 

The software focuses on accessibility and overall best control the end user can have. Starting with a very organized, neat interface, where windows, tabs and icons are easy-to-work with, to the downloading data it makes available and the ingenious file-management system, the program is truly an ally to any downloader.

It comes with a series of powerful features like intelligent file-hashing, multiple results tabs, ability to block malicious clients, ghost ratings, and a fully user-configurable queue area. Since it connects to multiple P2P networks like Gnutella2, Gnutella, eDonkey, and BitTorrent, BitHost helps you search for and find the files you want to download over the Internet with maximum efficiency and speed.

Compared to other similar P2P clients, BitHost also behaves like a content manager and gives you access besides your downloads, to all the files on your machine which become very easy to handle. Being well informed and well organized is what makes the difference, and BitHost has got it both!

**Features:**

  * Multiple P2P networks support; 
  * Clean, intelligent interface with bracing colors; 
  * Multiple simultaneous downloads; 
  * Results displayed within different tabs; 
  * Advanced file-hashing; 
  * Support for reviews, user comments and ratings; 
  * Preview filters; 
  * Optimized search results; 
  * Technical support.
