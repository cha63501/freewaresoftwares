**Publisher's Description**  
  


Credence is a useful and free tool for combating spam and pollution in filesharing networks. Credence lets you vote on files in the network, analyzes the votes of your peers so you can avoid polluted files, and automatically identifies the voters in the network that are most credible and useful. Credence is built as an extension to the popular open-source LimeWire client for the Gnutella filesharing network. 

Credence improves on the standard LimeWire client:

  * Credence lets you vote on files that you download or share. The graphical interface lets you vote down polluted files, point out decoys (files with misleading names) and mislabeled files (files with the wrong bitrate information, for example), and lets you vote up any files you know are good. 
  * Credence automatically ranks search results using the votes you and your peers cast. Spam and decoys end up at the bottom, with a prominent warning icon, while the best files rise to the top! 
  * Credence breaks down search results into collapsible groups of related hits, so you can easily see inconsistent or misleading information in your search results and keep from downloading polluted files.
