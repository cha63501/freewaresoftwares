**Publisher's Description**  
  

Modify some aspects of the user interface of Kazaa / Kazaa Lite K++: windowed
Interface (traffic, search, theater and other tabs are tiled), make Kazaa
window transparent, set window on top, hide the kazaa toolbars.

This tool is useful to put Kazaa in a corner of your screen to monitor your
downloads, while you use other programs. Use the multiple window interface to
view movies or search for new files without leaving the traffic window, or
minimize this tool to the system tray to hide the annoying ads panel or the
secondary toolbar.
