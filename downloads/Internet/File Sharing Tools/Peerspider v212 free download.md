Tired of jumping from one site to another searching for that file you need to
download? PeerSpider allows you to search multiple p2p sites with one single
go. Sites appear in their own tabs for easy browsing.

PeerSpider automatically checks for updates at runtime and informs you if any
are available.

You can remove or re-add site tabs from the settings menu.

PeerSpider does not need to be installed, just unzip and place the
PeerSpider.exe file anywhere you like. To remove just delete the file.
