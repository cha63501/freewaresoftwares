**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tresorit is an easy-to-use, cloud-based, secure file synchronizing software
designed to share confidential data. Simply turn any folder to a Tresor and
place a file into it and they will automatically sync with all computers
connected to the same account.

Encryption is performed before the data gets uploaded to the cloud, therefore
users do not have to trust the cloud provider nor the communication links.
Decryption is only possible with permission from the owner. Encrypted contents
can be shared without re-encryption.

**Note:** Users get 5GB of storage with their free account.
