**Publisher's Description**  
  

Basically, Nodezilla is an experimental grid based p2p system available for
Windows and Linux (on Intel platforms).

Technically, Nodezilla is a secured, distributed and fault tolerant routing
system (aka Grid Network). Its main purpose is to serve as a link for
distributed services built on top of it (like chat, efficient video
multicasting streaming, File Sharing, secured file store ...). Nodezilla
provides cache features; any server may create a local replica of any data
object. These local replicas provide faster access and robustness to network
partitions. They also reduce network congestion by localizing access traffic.
It is assumed that any server in the infrastructure may crash, leak
information, or become compromised, therefore in order to ensure data
protection, redundancy and cryptographic techniques are used.

**It currently offers three services:**

  * Anonymous File sharing, 
  * Hierarchical Multimedia Streaming, 
  * Digital photo sharing with selected friends.
