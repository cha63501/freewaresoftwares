**Publisher's Description**  
  

FolderShareTM allows you to create a private peer-to-peer network that will
help you to synchronize files across multiple devices and access or share
files with colleagues and friends. You no longer need to send large files via
email, burn them to CDs/DVDs and mail them, or upload them to a website.

FolderShare allows you to share and sync important information instantly with
anyone you invite, making it the perfect solution for personal or small
business use.

**Keep all your files in sync**  
Use FolderShare to create a mirrored image of your most important folders -
like your Favorites, Pictures, and Documents - so they're the same on all your
computers.

**Sharing files is easier than ever**  
Sharing with friends, co-workers, and family is easy when you add and update
files in a shared library. Large files? Not a problem - FolderShare can sync
files up to 2 GBs in size. And it works on both Mac and PC.

**Get to your files instantly when you're away from home**  
Install FolderShare on all your computers, and you can access all your files
from any computer on the Internet.
