**Publisher's Description**  
  


Share files and chat across a network without having to change any settings! 

You know itA's worth a try. Check it out! 

Have you ever had the problem of computers on a perfectly good network refusing to see each other or allow file sharing? 

We certainly have, and itA's even more difficult with different types of WindowsA(r) causing extra complications. 

**Shifty makes sharing files easier.**

Getting files and viewing transfers are both in the same window, so that you always know whatA's available, and what youA're currently downloading. The Transfers tab also keeps a log of what others have downloaded off you! 

Also included is a chat feature which allows you talk with all other Shifty users on your network A great for getting in touch with others and useful for asking for files to be shared... 

...and sharing your files couldnA't be easier; right-clicking the task bar logo and choosing Shared Files allows you pick what you want to make available to others on the fly. 

**One off file transfer? ThatA's fine too.**

The Explore and Chat windows both allow you to send any file you want, to anyone else on the network.
