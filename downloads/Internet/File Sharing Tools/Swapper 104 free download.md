Ever tried to send media to your friends? How much time did you waste
compressing, resizing or even, burning a CD? Imagine a program designed to
take care of all that for you, designed for people who hate to waste time as
much as you do. Swapper is the fastest application that privately swap media
files with friends and family. To start swapping, just enter your friendsA'
email, attach your files and Swapper will take care of the rest. ItA's that
easy!
