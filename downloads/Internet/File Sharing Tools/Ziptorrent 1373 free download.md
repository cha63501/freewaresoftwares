**Publisher's Description**  
  

ZipTorrent is the quickest and most efficient BitTorrent client around.
Installs in less than a minute (on broadband) and includes handy features such
as an easy to use interface, a search facility, multiple Torrent Details tabs,
and more!

ZipTorrent is a small and optimized BitTorrent client with big plans and a
huge potential, developed using pure C++ by volunteers from around the planet.
We want to make it simple for the average joe to join the growing world of
file sharing, without relying on a central resource (Decentralized
architecture).

ZipTorrent has two things some of the clients here do not here:

  1. An excellent (and very fast!) search facility, which allows you to also filter by seeders/leechers, torrent size, and so on. 
  2. A very nice multi-server IRC implementation that allows you to receive torrents automatically from bots or from other users. 
Besides that, many people who are considered very active within the BitTorrent
community have reported that with ZipTorrent they get the fastest download
speeds than with any other client, and I think that pretty much is what
matters most!

The rest is kinda moot since it pretty much does what all the other clients
do, looks great, takes very little memory, and so on. ZipTorrent uses the
opensource libtorrent, created by Arvid Norberg.

This new version will automatically reach you via our automatic update!
