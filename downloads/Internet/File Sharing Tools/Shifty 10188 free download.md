**Publisher's Description**  
  

Share files and chat across a network without having to change any settings!

You know itA's worth a try. Check it out!

Have you ever had the problem of computers on a perfectly good network
refusing to see each other or allow file sharing?

We certainly have, and itA's even more difficult with different types of
WindowsA(r) causing extra complications.

**Shifty makes sharing files easier.**

Getting files and viewing transfers are both in the same window, so that you
always know whatA's available, and what youA're currently downloading. The
Transfers tab also keeps a log of what others have downloaded off you!

Also included is a chat feature which allows you talk with all other Shifty
users on your network A great for getting in touch with others and useful for
asking for files to be shared...

...and sharing your files couldnA't be easier; right-clicking the task bar
logo and choosing Shared Files allows you pick what you want to make available
to others on the fly.

**One off file transfer? ThatA's fine too.**

The Explore and Chat windows both allow you to send any file you want, to
anyone else on the network.
