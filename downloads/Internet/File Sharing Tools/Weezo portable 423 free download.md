**Publisher's Description**  
  

Weezo turns your computer into a powerful and secure web server, thus enabling
you both to access your PC for personal use (remote desktop, file exchanges,
webcam monitoring...), and share your media (photos, music, videos, files, Web
TV...) with whoever you want. A simple web browser is required to access your
PC, with an OS-like skinnable interface. Shared resources are bound to
password-restricted user groups: you choose who can access what. Security can
be enhanced by using an SSL-encrypted connection.

All of this can be done instantly as there is no need to previously upload
required files on a distant web server, and without any size or format
limitation. Furthermore, you can be assured that privacy will be entirely
preserved as no personal data will go through online servers.

Weezo setup, configuration and use have been designed with simplicity as main
concern, and is thus accessible to everyone. Weezo is mostly open source, and
relies on open and secure technologies such as Apache, PHP and OpenSSL. This
permits add-ons to be easily developed, limitlessly extending your site: host
your blog, open a forum, check your email.
