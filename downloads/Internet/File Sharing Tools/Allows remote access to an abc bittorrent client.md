**Publisher's Description**  
  


RemoteABC is a Windows-based application that allows remote access to an ABC Bittorrent client. 

[ABC (Yet Another Bittorrent Client)](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_5_181_15856.html) is a great download client for Bittorrent files. Bittorrent is a peer-to-peer technology which uses downloadersA upload capacity to transmit files. Check out the web page for more info.

ABC is the best Windows-based BT client I could find, but I could not find a non-web based application to remotely access it.

Since I donAt want to run a web server on my machine, but I still want remote access to ABC, I wrote a dirty little GUI that does it for me.
