**Publisher's Description**  
  


TurboWire is currently one of the strongest p2p clients built. Think of Limewire with a bold attitude. To be as comfy as possible with the downloading process and to enable a more precise search, TurboWire let you specify you fields for title, artist, album, track number, genre, year, length and bitrate. 

TurboWire is a multi-platform Gnutella client, very resourceful when it comes to various features such as auto-connect, groups, browse host, multiple search, upload throttling, connection quality control, library management and efficient filtering. This software was designed for both beginners and savvy users. It is written in Java which means it supports Windows, Mac and Linux.

This is a file sharing program that manages to keep in balance the functional and the visual aspect. Its interface is very stylish and at the same time extremely easy to use. Everything you demand from a P2P Gnutella client is right here and using TurboWire will connect you to one of the largest user communities out there and a gigantic data base for files.

In terms of design TurboWire presents a remarkably attractive interface, well thought out, and easy to operate. Little usability embellishments, such as automatic removal of cancelled downloads (this is a tedious, unintuitive two-step procedure in other P2P clients) and direct connection to known IP addresses for exchanging files with friends, made us feel that the designers actually use the program.

TurboWire includes a full-page connection monitor which lets you easily handle incoming searches of your own shared folder and also track files being uploaded from your machine by other people. ThereAs a main window which includes three large panes, a status bar that presents you with all the information you need regarding your connection: if you are behind a firewall, the number of shared files and the download/upload speed.

Moreover, TurboWire provides its own built-in media player so you can launch the downloaded files as soon as they are complete A you can listen to music or view videos while searching and checking out your downloads.

In case you use DC clients (direct connect protocol) on a regular basis youAll be pleasantly surprised with using TurboWire A if before you couldnAt do a search and then follow with another one shortly after (simply, the hubsA' settings work this way), now this is no longer an issue A just go right ahead and search freely for any files you want!
