**Publisher's Description**  
  

Freenet is free software which lets you publish and obtain information on the
Internet without fear of censorship. To achieve this freedom, the network is
entirely decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are
anonymous. Without anonymity there can never be true freedom of speech, and
without decentralization the network will be vulnerable to attack.

Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are "routed-through" other
nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the
information and what its content is.

Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their
hard drive (called the "data store") for storing files. Unlike other peer-to-
peer file sharing networks, Freenet does not let the user control what is
stored in the data store. Instead, files are kept or deleted depending on how
popular they are, with the least popular being discarded to make way for newer
or more popular content. Files in the data store are encrypted to reduce the
likelihood of prosecution by persons wishing to censor Freenet content.

**Note:** Freenet works best with Windows XP Professional or Vista. Some problems have been reported with the installer on Windows 7, this will be fixed soon. Freenet will not run on anything older than Windows 2000 Professional (i.e. 95/98/ME), and in any case you should not run an operating system for which security support has been discontinued.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
