**Publisher's Description**  
  

GPU is a Gnutella client that allows users to share CPU-resources. GPU allows
the creation of computer alliances. The CPU-time sharing system does not
recognize privileges between users. Each person agrees to provide network
resources as needed and in return is able to get CPU-cycles from other clients
on the network system.

Plugins extend the capabilities of client nodes and are compiled so as to take
advantage of the power of the latest processors. Right now, this client allows
rendering of Terragen movies. An experimental search engine is included, too.
GPU cluster size typically ranges from 5 to 15 computers. It is possible to
organize ourself in teams and view statistics. Help us with your pioneer
attitude in tweaking and improving this 15GHz monster :) (which is under GPL
and targets only peaceful goals btw).
