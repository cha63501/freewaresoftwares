TorrentFetcher is a handy utility program for making searching for torrents
just a bit easier.

**Features:**

  * Search through multiple pages of torrents at once. 
  * Automatically move downloaded torrents to a specified output directory (good for bittorrent clients that monitor a specific folder, like uTorrent). 
  * Automatically launch downloaded torrents. 
  * Know which torrent files you already have in your downloaded folder through automatic highlighting. 
  * Results highlighting lets you know if a torrent is well or poorly seeded or if it has negative comments left about it. 
  * Automatic detection and removal of "denis stalker" trackers using the MonoTorrent library. 
  * Minimize-to-tray option to keep the utility handy at all times.
