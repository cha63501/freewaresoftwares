**Publisher's Description**  
  

DC++ is an open source client for Windows for the Direct Connect network.
Direct Connect allows you to share files over the Internet without
restrictions or limits. The client is completely free of advertisements and
has a nice, easy to use interface. Firewall and router support is integrated
and it is easy and convenient to use functionality like multi-hub connections,
auto-connections and resuming of downloads.

The Direct Connect network is a decentralized network, made up of individual
servers (hubs) that users join to share files with other members on that hub.
Each hub is individually run by a fellow user of the Direct Connect network,
and may have certain themes to the content on the hub. Hub owners set up rules
to regulate their hub as they see fit.
