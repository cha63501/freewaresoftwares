**Publisher's Description**  
  

RemoteABC is a Windows-based application that allows remote access to an ABC
Bittorrent client.

[ABC (Yet Another Bittorrent
Client)](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_5_181_15856.html) is a great
download client for Bittorrent files. Bittorrent is a peer-to-peer technology
which uses downloadersA upload capacity to transmit files. Check out the web
page for more info.

ABC is the best Windows-based BT client I could find, but I could not find a
non-web based application to remotely access it.

Since I donAt want to run a web server on my machine, but I still want remote
access to ABC, I wrote a dirty little GUI that does it for me.
