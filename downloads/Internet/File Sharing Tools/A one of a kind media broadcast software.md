One of the most popular uses of TvAnts is to watch international football league matches that are only available on pay-per-view channels in your own country. For this, it is creating increasing controversy and followers at the same time.

After installing it, TVants will take you through the setup instruction (in poor English) and will automatically bring up the channels available for streaming.Many are in Chinese or Japanese but you can also get BBC World, CNN plus many more. This site devoted to TvAnts can help you get started.

A fantastic application that streams quicker and more consistently than many other similar versions.
