**Publisher's Description**  
  

SecureFileTransfer allows you to transmit files securely, those who intercept
it can not be traced back to the plaintext data.

How it works:  
Through communication between two computers, both must be present
securefiletransfer (freeware, open source under New BSD license) one of which
generates a key pair for asymmetric encryption, sends the public key to
another computer that produces a symmetric key and sends the first computer
after it is encrypted with the public key, the computer that receives
possesses the private key to decrypt the symmetric key asymmetric and at this
point the two computers are aware of a symmetric key through Rijndael (AES
"implementation") is able to produce a level of encryption security that a
brute force attack currently require time processing machine virtually
impossible, the public key is exchanged in clear in 1024 is not feasible, then
bit back to the private key.

Server mode allows the program to create an unlimited number of users each of
which is defined a username and password for each user is defined as a
directory to read exactly what the user can access a directory read and write
where the user has write access, for example the user with username "test" and
password "mypassword" will have access to read the entire C: drive and write
to c: \ Users \ test \ documents, to request or send the file should of course
add to the server and send your username and password that will go on the
Internet encrypted, as all data exchanged with Rijndael.

SecureFileTransfer software encrypts all data stored locally that all data
directories for user username passwords using rinjadeal and password as a
password application that you choose your choice the first time you use the
application and will then write to each boot and for each critical operation
for amending or creating user accounts, password entry application (which can
be a few characters) and some data (such as the user password is via virtual
qwerty, this will completely avoids that a key logger can steal your login
information to your file server (securefiletransfer in server mode).

**Features:**

**Server:**

  * Entering the password-application - Creating user: 1.choose username 2.chhose password 3.choose scelta directory with write access 4. choose directory read access. 

**Client:**

  * Password Entry Application 
  * Creating connection: 
    1. Insert ip address 
    2. Test ping (possible) 
    3. connection with insertion of username and password for that server (securefiletransfer server mode) 
    4. save connection name 
  * Choice of a connection between a list of connections and its opening with recovery of the list files that match the directory reading 
  * At this point the user can choose which file to recover in a grid, of course, may recover successively more A'file. Or which file-ship of his car to the remote server in the directory to which it has rights in writing 

**Common client and server features:**

  * Transfer SecureFile program provides initial and principal in the form of a read-only console where I write the main events and errors that occurred during the operation of the program, the program allows you to save a click in a txt file content of this console, 
  * the software produces a txt file error log can be opened from the menu, 
  * the program can be added or removed from the execution of automatic windows user selectable menu
