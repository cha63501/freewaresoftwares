**Publisher's Description**  
  


FotoTagger is a free tool for annotating images. Place movable easy-to-hide notes over a picture to identify people and places. Mark notable details. Add explanation notes. Instantly find a particular person or object among image collections. Publish annotated images directly to blogs at Blogger.com and LiveJournal. Annotations do not change an original image so moving and sharing files keep annotations intact. FotoTagger works with JPEG files. 

**Features:**

  * Identify people, places, and events on digital photos. 
  * Mark notable details and comment specific objects. 
  * Display your tags in a form of balloons. Create talking pictures, books of comics and image macros from your photos. 
  * Publish annotated images to Blogger and LiveJournal. 
  * Upload annotated pictures to Flickr and download them back to FotoTagger with Flickr notes preserved. 
  * Organize images. 
  * Find elements of images in a couple of clicks. 
  * Create animated GIF files.
