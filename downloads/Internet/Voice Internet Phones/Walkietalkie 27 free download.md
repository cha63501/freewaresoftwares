Walkietalkie is a program which allows full duplex voice communications over
the internet. All both parties need is a PC or Mac and a microphone. It is
free to use and distribute. It just streams audio between points on the
internet, there are no servers, so it canA't be regulated or taken away.

This version includes many new features:

  * AES encryption 
  * call username (instead of ip) 
  * wt-locator server for locating users by name and working around firewall/router NAT 
  * something vaguely resembling a user guide..
