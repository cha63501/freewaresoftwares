**Publisher's Description**  
  


Lanic is a tool for voice communication between computers connected to a Local Area Network and its operation is comparable to a classic intercom. The initiating computer can select the computer to which it wishes to make a connection in a list displaying all the currently connected machines on which Lanic is running. 

Though Lanic makes use of the TCP/IP protocol, it is not intended to be used as an Internet Phone. Doing so may crash the local and/or the remote computer.
