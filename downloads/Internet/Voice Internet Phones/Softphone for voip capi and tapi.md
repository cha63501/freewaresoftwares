**Publisher's Description**  
  


This application enables voice connections to landline, cellular network and VoIP. Phoner can be used as a softphone on stationary and mobile computer devices attached to analogue or digital (ISDN) subscriber lines and as an SIP client. 

**What modes does Phoner support?**

**VoIP/SIP**  
SIP is the most used protocol for establishing voice calls over IP connections. By supporting SIP, Phoner can contact a wide range of peers like Asterisk and countless VoIP providers. the advantage is, that only a functional Internet connection is necessary.

**CAPI**  
If the PC is connected to a PBX or PSTN with an ISDN terminal adapter , all supplementary services can used, that are supported by the CAPI . The PC then acts like a normal ISDN phone. CAPI drivers will be provided by the manufacturer of the ISDN hardware.

**TAPI**  
TAPI is a generic interface for all kinds of communication hardware. That can be a PBX,a telephone or a built in PC hardware. This wide range of possibilities is a disadvantage on the other side This is the reason for the stopped development of this mode in Phoner.
