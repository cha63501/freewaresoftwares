**Publisher's Description**  
  

Lanic is a tool for voice communication between computers connected to a Local
Area Network and its operation is comparable to a classic intercom. The
initiating computer can select the computer to which it wishes to make a
connection in a list displaying all the currently connected machines on which
Lanic is running.

Though Lanic makes use of the TCP/IP protocol, it is not intended to be used
as an Internet Phone. Doing so may crash the local and/or the remote computer.
