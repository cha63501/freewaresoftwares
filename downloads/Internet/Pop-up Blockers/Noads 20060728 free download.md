**Publisher's Description**  
  

NoAds is a program that detects when Internet popup advertisements appear, and
quickly closes them. A popup ad is an ad that appears in a new Web browser
window, and requires the user to manually close that window. NoAds is fully
configurable, allowing the user to specify which ads they want to close
automatically. The program is very easy to use, and stays running in the
system tray for quick access.
