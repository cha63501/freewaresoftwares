**Publisher's Description**  
  

PumpKIN is an open source, fully functional, free TFTP server and TFTP client,
which implements TFTP according to RFC1350. It also implements block size
option, which allows transfer of files over 32MB, as well as transfer size and
transfer timeout options described in RFC2348 and RFC2349.

The primary use of PumpKIN is maintenance of the network equipment (such as
router firmware upgrade) that fetches images from TFTP server, although it is
also useful for transfering files between parties involved in a conversation
over ntalk connection using our T42 software (it also detects ntalk
conversation held over now obsolete program A'wintalkA').

**Features:**

  * Fully standard-compliant TFTP file transfer 
  * Unlimited simultaneous transfers both for TFTP server and client 
  * Support for TFTP blocksize option allows transfer of large files if both TFTP server and client support it 
  * Convenient GUI 
  * Combines TFTP server and TFTP client 
  * Originally developed for Windows 95, it reportedly runs on all Win32 platforms: Windows 98, Windows NT, ME, XP 
  * Can run in background, taking up a 256 pixels of screen nicely packed as a 16x16 square in your notification tray area 
  * Open source for those willing to add missing features, fix bugs and examine code for potential flaws and fun 
  * YouA're free to torture it the way you want to as long as you preserve original authorA's credentials 
Note that PumpKIN is not an FTP server, neither it is a FTP client, it is a
TFTP server and TFTP client. TFTP is not FTP, these are different protocols.
TFTP, unlike FTP, is used primarily for transferring files to and from the
network equipment (e.g. your router, switch, hub, whatnot firmware upgrade or
backup, or configuration backup and restore) that supports using of TFTP
server for, not for general purpose serving downloadable files or retrieving
files from the FTP servers around the world.
