**Publisher's Description**  
  


Virtually all FTP clients use password caching. This means it is very easy to find out a password. The universal solution lies in FTP server imitation. FTP clients will reveal the password during the transaction. FPR uses this method to recover lost passwords. 

FPR is intended to recover YOUR passwords only. It just extracts passwords stored on your computer. It is not a hackerA's tool, FPR does not allow to crack somebody elseA's password (in most cases it is illegal).
