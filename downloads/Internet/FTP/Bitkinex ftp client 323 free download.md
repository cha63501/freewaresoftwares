BitKinex is a handy network client supporting multiple transfer protocols
(FTP, FTP(S), SFTP, HTTP(S) and WebDAV). In contrast to other clients BitKinex
uses multiple connections not only for file transfers but for browsing remote
directories as well. With just one click you can minimize the space occupied
by the program to one small window showing the status of running requests, and
with just a few clicks you can see all the details again.

In addition to features found in other popular FTP clients (like support for
the SSL/SSH, multipart and multithreaded transfers, file filtering, direct
server-to-server transfers or scheduling) BitKinex introduces several unique
approaches and solutions.

**Features:**

  * Browse Windows Never Freeze 
  * Robust Request Handling Saves Your Time and Your Data 
  * Indirect Transfers Give More Power to Basic and Advanced Users 
  * User Interface DoesnA't Clutter Your Desktop 
  * Inherited Properties Enable Easy and Powerful Configuration 
  * Expanded Number of Supported Protocols and Security Standards
