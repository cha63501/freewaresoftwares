**Publisher's Description**  
  

DropUpLoad is a very light, simple, strong and useful Upload spooler for FTP
management. It goes over connection errors and finishes the job even in pretty
bad conditions.

No installation required. Copy the DropUpLoad.exe file on your disk and
double-click on it. You can create as many servers as you want. They will
appear in a combo box on the top of the DropUpLoad window. Then, select a
server, and drop your file on the window. The file will be added to the spool
listing and the upload will be done as soon as possible regarding your
connection and the server availability. Each file can have a different
destination if you change server between each drop.
