**Publisher's Description**  
  

FtpSearch is used to search for files recursively on one or more ftp servers
using multiple threads. ItA's just to extend to local file searching function
to the realm of ftp servers. You just specify a file pattern and a list of ftp
server addresses together with a starting directory and FtpSearch will do all
the searching job for you automatically. It saves you a lot of time clicking
into the directories of ftp servers and looking for files using your eyes.

FtpSearch is especially useful when you are in a wide-band connection.
Otherwise the advantage of parallel searching will be limited by your phone
line. When the searching is complete, all matching files will be listed and
you can select any one of them to download with your default browser. You can
copy its URL and download it with your preferred download manager. FtpSearch
is suitable to search for freeware, shareware, mp3 files on anonymous ftp
servers at a very fast speed.
