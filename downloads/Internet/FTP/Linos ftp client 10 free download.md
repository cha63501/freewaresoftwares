**Publisher's Description**  
  

Why use your web browser to download or upload a file from an FTP server.
TheyA're slow, hard to use and un-reliable. Why purchase a retail version
spending as much a $80.00 US. This freeware program has all the functions you
need to access your favorite FTP site, upload or download any files or
directory. With this FTP client you have other useful functions like delete,
rename, create directory, or delete directory (assuming you have the
authority).
