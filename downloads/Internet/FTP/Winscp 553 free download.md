WinSCP is a free SFTP client that you can use to transfer files securely. The
small Windows program allows users to copy files safely between local and
remote computers using Secure Shell technology. It is compatible with
different protocols, including Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), File Transfer
Protocol (FTP) and Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol (SSH FTP). You can also
use it to perform basic file management functions.

**Installing WinSCP**

During the installation of WinSCP, we had to choose between two user
interfaces: commander and explorer. We opted for the commander interface,
which provided two panels for local and remote directories respectively.

**Using WinSCP**

Before we could start using the Windows FTP client, we had to choose the file
protocol we wanted to use and enter host name, port number, username and
password. The tools tab, on the lower left corner, allowed us to do a number
of things, including running pageant, setting preferences, backing up and
restoring configuration.

The program allowed us to make several configurations under preferences,
including changing the user interface selected during installation.

Transferring files was as easy as selecting them and pressing F5. We could
also use the mouse to drag and drop files. We were able to perform a number of
operations both locally and remotely so long as our server supported them.
These included editing files, renaming them and changing their permissions.

One of the things that make WinSCP stand apart is the enhanced security it
provides. Security was not considered a major issue when the process of
transferring files over networks was started. However, as more computers and
people joined the network, risks increased significantly.

Although it is easy to use FTP clients, there are high chances of using an
insecure connection. The risks are pronounced when users transfer such
sensitive data as confidential company information, projects and bank account
details. Even a tiny security gap can leave all people in a network
vulnerable.

Inclusion of the Console Window also came in handy, as we used it to execute
remote commands that required no user input. This feature is dependent on
server compatibility. In addition, we could connect to more than one network
at the same time and manage all open connections easily.

**Conclusion**

If you want a free SFTP client that provides secure connections for file
transfers, then WinSCP is your answer.
