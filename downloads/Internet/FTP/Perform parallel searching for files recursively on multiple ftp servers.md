**Publisher's Description**  
  


FtpSearch is used to search for files recursively on one or more ftp servers using multiple threads. ItA's just to extend to local file searching function to the realm of ftp servers. You just specify a file pattern and a list of ftp server addresses together with a starting directory and FtpSearch will do all the searching job for you automatically. It saves you a lot of time clicking into the directories of ftp servers and looking for files using your eyes. 

FtpSearch is especially useful when you are in a wide-band connection. Otherwise the advantage of parallel searching will be limited by your phone line. When the searching is complete, all matching files will be listed and you can select any one of them to download with your default browser. You can copy its URL and download it with your preferred download manager. FtpSearch is suitable to search for freeware, shareware, mp3 files on anonymous ftp servers at a very fast speed.
