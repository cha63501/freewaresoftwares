FTPDrive is a free tool that emulates logical drive, where selected FTP/FTPS servers are mounted as folders. Useful for example for viewing films, listening files directly from FTP server without pre-downloading whole file. This is achieved by emulation of virtual drive, on which FTP servers are placed on the Native NT API level.

FTP Drive is compatible with many applications, except those, that use own drivers to access files. FtpDrive can cache directories structure and read files data.
