**Publisher's Description**  
  

Rightload is a small program that allows you to quickly upload files directly
from a Windows folder to your server. Instead of using complicated software
just to upload a few pictures, you just right-click on the files, select the
server and target folder and Rightload will do the rest for you.

There are also a lot of additional features for advanced users including:
Automatic thumbnail creation, creating a list of uploaded files in BB-Code or
HTML to paste into forums or websites and support for HTTP upload sites like
ImageShack.

From version 1.6, Rightload supports custom upload plugins that can handle a
wide variety of server types. This will become the preferred way for uploads,
replacing the pre-defined server files. The latest version already comes with
plugins for Facebook, Flickr and Imageshack.

Additionally, the following plugins are available. Please extract them to a
folder called "plugins" in your Rightload program directory. Then, restart
Rightload, open the options and enable the desired plugins in the "Plugins"
tab.
