**Publisher's Description**  
  

Portable FileZilla will allow you to carry a whole FTP client with you on an
USB thumbdrive, iPod, portable hard drive or any other portable media. You can
plug it right into any Windows computer and use it just like you would on your
own.

It is a repackaged version of the popular FileZilla FTP client designed with
portability in mind, so it has all the same great features of FileZilla, but
thereA's nothing to install.

**WhatA's new in version 3.8.0:**

**Bugfixes and minor changes:**

  * Popup dialogs no longer automatically open if other dialogs are already open. This prevents FileZilla from becoming unresponsive on OS X 
  * Fix calculation of current transfer speed. In some situations the transfer speed tooltip over the activity indicators showed negative speeds 
  * Fix handling of focus item in local directory listings if connecting to a site with a default local directory
