**Publisher's Description**  
  


Auto FTP v2 is the new big brother of the original Auto FTP. It can perform multiple ftp sessions simultaneously (fully multi-threaded). You can choose between straight file copy or synchronization in either direction (local to remote or remote to local). 

Sessions can be started manually, timed, change triggered or daisy chained. Multiple sessions can be started from the command line making it a great batch file tool. Now you can have as many upload or download ftp sessions as you like configured and ready to go with one click.
