**Publisher's Description**  
  

Browsing with an FTP client is always fascinating. With NetFinger you can
navigate through the folders and files of a remote server as if they were on
your own hard disks. You can simultaneously upload or download a maximum of 3
files or folders per server. While transfers are running in the background,
you can also browse one or more servers.

An address book helps you to quickly connect to your favorite FTP servers.
Without downloading you can preview JPEG, GIF, BMP, ICO, EMF and WMF images -
handling a maximum of 15 files simultaneously. You can listen to MP3s without
fully downloading them: a preset amount of the file is downloaded and fed into
your favorite mediaplayer, so you donA't have to download some music you
donA't like. WhatA's more, you can do the same with MPEG videos, too.

Additionally, you can "peep into" text files. NetFinger is skinnable and comes
with a set of 5 different skins. You will have no problem using this software
behind a firewall of proxy server.
