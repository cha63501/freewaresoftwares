**Publisher's Description**  
  

Protofile is an FTP client application with tons of features. It supports drag
and drop, recursive uploads/downloads, an online ASCII editor and an image
viewer and a color-coded status window. Each transfer is put in a queue and
handled in the background, so you can continue your normal operations. All
these features are in a fully customizable, extensible GUI with bars to move
all parts. Your sites are kept in a reliable profile manager, so they can be
accessed faster.

**New Features:**

  * HTTP download manager, for all your HTTP download needs. 
  * A configuration panel to easily access all options. 
  * Multiple drag an drop (it was only single before)! 
  * A really more stable queue to handle transfers, completely remade. 
  * Automatically save your logs in text or RTF format, access them with Word and keep track of what you do! 
  * The Log menu has appeared in the main menu, for all log options. 
  * These things have been put in the toolbar and for more information, look at the WhatA's hot section of the program.
