**Publisher's Description**  
  


IA've received a number of email messages asking how to make a basic FTP server, without a fancy UI or lots of features. This Baby FTP server has only the most necessary features and is yet powerful enough to be a basis for a more complex server. 

**Features:**

  * Supports most RFC959 FTP commands 
  * Supports PASV and non-PASV mode 
  * Only allows anonymous connections 
  * Multi threaded 
  * Real time server log 
  * Configure home directory (same for all connections) 
  * Set permissions for download/upload/rename/delete/create directory
