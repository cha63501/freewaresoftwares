DropUpLoad is a very light, simple, strong and useful Upload spooler for FTP management. It goes over connection errors and finishes the job even in pretty bad conditions. 

No installation required. Copy the DropUpLoad.exe file on your disk and double-click on it. You can create as many servers as you want. They will appear in a combo box on the top of the DropUpLoad window. Then, select a server, and drop your file on the window. The file will be added to the spool listing and the upload will be done as soon as possible regarding your connection and the server availability. Each file can have a different destination if you change server between each drop.
