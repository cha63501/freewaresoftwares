**Publisher's Description**  
  

FTPDrive is a free tool that emulates logical drive, where selected FTP/FTPS
servers are mounted as folders. Useful for example for viewing films,
listening files directly from FTP server without pre-downloading whole file.
This is achieved by emulation of virtual drive, on which FTP servers are
placed on the Native NT API level.

FtpDrive can intercept opening ftp:// links from other applications--simple
press Ctrl key while opening ftp:// path and it will be opened on FtpDrive.
FTP Drive is compatible with many applications, except those, that use own
drivers to access files. FtpDrive can cache directories structure and read
files data. Directories structure stored in memory, cached files resides in
%TEMP%FtpDrive.tmp directory, you can change caching settings.
