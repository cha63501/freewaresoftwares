**Publisher's Description**  
  

wzdftpd is a modular cross-platform multi-threaded FTP server which is in
active development. You can run wzdftpd on Linux, Windows, FreeBSD or OpenBSD
and it is entirely configurable online using SITE commands. This program is
free open source software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

**Features:**

  * Simple configuration file, supporting inclusions 
  * Online administration, using SITE commands 
  * Backends to store users/groups in different structures 
  * Modules: internal, using shared libraries, or external (scripts/applications), and protocols 
  * Extension scripts can be written in Tcl or Perl 
  * Powerful event system 
  * Job scheduler, also known as crontab 
  * Users are virtual: you do not need to create users in system 
  * Support for UTF-8: Unicode filenames 
  * SSL/TLS support 
  * IPv6 support (Experimental) 
  * Designed to run as a non-privileged user to enforce security 
  * Can detect IP changes (dynamic IPA's) and set IP and passive IP accordingly 
  * Cross device operations (copy/move) (though this can be slow) 
  * Logging support (compatible with the wu-ftpd standard) 
  * Designed for high performances: coded with C, multithreaded 
  * Portable: runs on Linux, BSD and Windows 
  * Compliance with RFC standards 
  * zeroconf support: the FTP service can be published on the network 
  * Inbuilt cookies parser for FTP control messages and external event triggers 
  * On-the-fly CRC calculation for use with external zipscripts/sfvscripts 
  * Virtual file system (VFS) support 

**System Requirements:** The Windows installer does not come bundled with the [OpenSSL binaries](http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) and therefore you need to have these preinstalled on your system. Make sure you download and install the OpenSSL binaries package before installing wzdftpd. If you are using an older version of Windows you may also need to [download the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SP1 Runtime Libraries](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=200b2fd9-ae1a-4a14-984d-389c36f85647&displaylang=en) from the Microsoft website.
