**Publisher's Description**  
  

Encrypted FTP is the fast, easy way to send and receive files to and from your
PC. With data transfer rates literally unaffected by real time encryption
mode, the perfect solution for total security. Just install it, configure it
much like any other server/client program and itA's ready to use. Compatible
with most other Server or Client based applications in standard A'non
encryptedA' mode.

Encrypted FTP is a 32bit combined Client/Server application, basically 2
programs in one. It incorporates the 448bit Blowfish Encryption Algorithm and
the FTP protocol (RFC 959 implementation) to provide secure file transfers
over TCP/IP based networks (The Internet) providing strong encryption when the
remote and local hosts both use it.
