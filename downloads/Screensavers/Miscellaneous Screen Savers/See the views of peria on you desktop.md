**Publisher's Description**  
  


Persia is the former name of Iran, the country with long history. Under Cyrus the Great and Darius the Great, the Persian Empire eventually became the largest and most powerful empire in human history up until that point. Dozens of pre-historic sites across the Iranian plateau point to the existence of ancient cultures. 

This screensaver will help you to make the trip to Persia to see the modern cities and ruins of the ancient civilizations.
