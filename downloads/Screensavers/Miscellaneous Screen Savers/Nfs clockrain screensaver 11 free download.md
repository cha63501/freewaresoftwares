A screensaver, ClockRain, displays time in a digital format on your monitor.
When the time changing, the numbers drop down like drops of rain and create
water circles. The numbers of the blue colour show hours, minutes and seconds.
The clock numbers are big and can be easily seen from everywhere. No spyware,
no adware, virus-free.
