The Paintball screensaver turns your screen into a painterA's canvas, painting a picture in semi-impressionistic style using bouncing balls or (new in v2.0) blots of splattering paint. 

Five 3D-rendered images are included but you can also load images of your own choice, or let the saver make a painting of your desktop. You can adjust the fuzzyness of the painting by changing the size of the spots. The number of bouncing balls can vary from 1 to 64.

**WhatA's New in version 2.2:**

  * added option to change the colour of the starting canvas 
  * new setting screen
