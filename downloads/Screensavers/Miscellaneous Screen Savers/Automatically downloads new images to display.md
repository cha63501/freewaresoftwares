**Publisher's Description**  
  


You probably already tried the Windows screensaver that displays a slideshow of your own photos stored on your computer. The revolutionary iShare Screensaver does exactly the opposite, it displays other users photos on your computer, and allows everyone to easily share their favorite pictures and to vote for others photos. Every day a new image is automatically downloaded so you will always have new fresh pictures to watch. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
