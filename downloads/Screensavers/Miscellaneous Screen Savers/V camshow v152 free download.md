**Publisher's Description**  
  

**V-CamShow** is a free webcam slide show and screen saver. It enables you to watch your favorite webcams as a slide show or a screen saver. There is no limit to the number of webcams you can view. New webcams are added regularly which can be imported into your list. You can also add your own webcam to the list and increase your viewers. 

V-CamShow employs an intelligent algorithm to auto-detect and auto-adjust the
refresh rate - this will work for most, though not all, cams. This prevents
you from downloading the same image over and over again. It can also detect
slow or inactive cams and, depending on your choice, can either reduce their
refresh rate or disable them completely, all done automatically. You can also
set operation times for each cam individually so you can have different cams
enabled at different times of the day - very useful if you are watching cams
from different parts of the world.
