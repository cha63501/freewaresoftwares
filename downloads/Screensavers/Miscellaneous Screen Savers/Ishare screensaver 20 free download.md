**Publisher's Description**  
  

You probably already tried the Windows screensaver that displays a slideshow
of your own photos stored on your computer. The revolutionary iShare
Screensaver does exactly the opposite, it displays other users photos on your
computer, and allows everyone to easily share their favorite pictures and to
vote for others photos. Every day a new image is automatically downloaded so
you will always have new fresh pictures to watch.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
nloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows
XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
