Screensaver with hand drawn and painted images of different aspects of Florida. overtime, we have used various different hand drawn and painted images as graphic elements on our web site and in other associated promotional content. because a lot of people showed interest in these we thought it might be a nice idea to release them in the form of a screensaver. the screensaver features various different aspects of Florida.

Once you have done so you will find that it activates itself after your default period of time and to be managed in exactly the same way as any other screensaver that came preinstalled on your computer.

In an attempt to allow the widest possible number of people to utilize our screensaver we have made every effort to keep the download file size small sows to keep this screensaver accessible to people who are using dial-up connections. Despite the attention of the detail of keeping the file size down, the images are still of high quality as it was important to us that the resolution was maintained as well. We will also be releasing other ranges of images that we have previously used as graphic elements as screensavers in the near future.
