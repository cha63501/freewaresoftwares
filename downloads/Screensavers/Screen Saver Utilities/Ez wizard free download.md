**Publisher's Description**  
  

EZ Wizard provides a simple point and click interface to enable monitor power
management on Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000 and XP systems saving up to $50 / yr in
energy costs.

Personal computers use more energy than all other desktop and office equipment
combined. Unfortunately, much of this energy is needlessly expended while the
computer sits idle, perhaps while you are in a meeting, on the telephone, or
at lunch. Fortunately, we can reduce this waste through the use of ENERGY
STAR, which can turn off your monitor, your computerA's most consuming
component, during idle time. To easily activate the ENERGY STAR capabilities
of your system, run the EZ Wizard. If you arenA't already using ENERGY STAR,
the program will ask if you want to activate it. If you do, it then will ask
how long you want your system to sit idle before it goes to sleep; you can
choose 10, 15, or 20 minutes. In some cases, it will ask if you want to be
able to see your screen saver before the monitor goes to sleep. Once you have
answered these questions, the program will turn on the ENERGY STAR features
that work with your monitor.
