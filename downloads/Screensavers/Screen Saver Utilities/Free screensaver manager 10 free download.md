**Publisher's Description**  
  

This free desktop utility allows you to manage multiple screensavers on your
computer.

It has two main goals. Start installed screensavers randomly from a custom
selection. Prevent temporarily a screensaver from starting when you need to
maximize your processor or memory resources.

For example, defragmenting your hard disk. It allows you to select which
screensavers you want to enable or disable. Whatever the number of
screensavers installed on your computer, you can select only the ones you want
to see.
