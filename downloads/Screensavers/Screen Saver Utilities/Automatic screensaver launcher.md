**Publisher's Description**  
  


This small formless assembler-compiled applet of mere 3KB will help you to load your default screensaver the way Windows normally doesnA't allow you to - on the system startup or with a keyboard shortcut. How? First copy the programA's EXE into a folder of your choice. 

Next: 1) create a shortcut of the EXE and place it into your Startup shortcut group. On the next restart of Windows the system will start with your default screensaver loaded..., 2) create a shortcut of the EXE and place it into the Accessories shortcut group. 

Right-click on it selecting Properties. Click with your mouse in the Shortcut Key edit box and choose your preferred shortcut (e.g., F12). Confirm OK and youA're done! You will just have created a system-aware F12 keyboard shortcut loading your default screensaver when working with ANY application.
