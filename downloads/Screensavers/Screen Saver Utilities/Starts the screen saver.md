**Publisher's Description**  
  


I wrote this program after becoming used to the standard OS X feature that allows you to activate the screen saver by moving the mouse cursor into the corner of the screen. After scouring the internet for a simple solution to activate the screen saver manually on a Windows machine and finding no FREE way to do so, I took it upon myself to create a simple little program to do just that. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
