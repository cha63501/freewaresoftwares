**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program is very similar to my other project StartScreenSaver except that when this program is run, it places an icon in the system tray (next to the clock) instaed of starting the screen saver immediately. This icon allows the user to manually start the screen saver by double-clicking on it. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
