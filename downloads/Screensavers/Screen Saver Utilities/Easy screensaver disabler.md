**Publisher's Description**  
  


Run ScreenSaver Disabled! when you temporarily do not want your default screensaver engaged after the time specified in its settings and would prefer to keep it "out of business" until a certain type of job is done. This may come handy in numerous situations - e.g., when defragmenting your hard disk, running system checking, testing and repairing utilities (ScanDisk, Norton Disk Doctor, benchmarking software, system diagnostics programs, etc.) or when recording a CD, to mention just a few. 

During all these and similar instances the screensaverA's activity just may not be that much desired and wanted and may also cause problems. Instead of manually disabling it clicking through its system settings (and later manually re-enabling it again...), use this tiny program to do it automatically. 

Create a shortcut to the programA's EXE and run it when needed - your default screensaver will be disabled until you close this program (the applicationA's mini-window will load in the bottom-right corner of your screen - just above the system tray - and will stay on top of other progs; you may minimize it if you prefer to hide it off screen).
