This screen saver was created using only the highest quality photographs
available for the objects in our solar system. You will see the sun, all the
planets, many moons, comets and asteroids! You wonA't find a more attractive
screen saver of its kind. There is a nice soundtrack (from Star Trek II - The
Wrath of Khan) which is mutable. It has many smooth transition effects. You
can change the transitions as well as display length, size, background, order
and position settings. You can even change the screen saver mode to collage,
slide show, or floating. All of the photos include captions. It can be quite
educational.
