This screen saver was created using only the highest quality photographs available for the objects in our solar system. You will see the sun, all the planets, many moons, comets and asteroids! You wonA't find a more attractive screen saver of its kind. There is a nice soundtrack (from Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan) which is mutable. It has many smooth transition effects. You can change the transitions as well as display length, size, background, order and position settings. You can even change the screen saver mode to collage, slide show, or floating. All of the photos include captions. It can be quite educational.
