This screen saver displays animated neutrons. 

A neutron is a heavy elementary particle that lacks electrical charge and is a part of an atomic nucleus. Sounds really interesting... right?

Well, this is what you can do with them:

You can select how many neutrons you want (up to 500, if your hardware can handle it!) and how they flow around on your screen. You can also set the speed and length of them (screen shot 1). Choose your favorite colors or let the system select them for you (screen shot 2). 

All the screen shots referred in this text can be found on the developerA's website.

**WhatA's New in version 2.02:**

  * You can interact with the neutrons (play with them) just hit the key A'Caps LockA' once and start playing.
