Soft light of the lantern returns you back to the good old days of childhood, when you went fishing and camping. Living in the age of electricity and neon signs you canA't help but wonder - why is this old lantern so precious to me? Is it because of the spooky stories told around it? Or is it because of that strange smell of kerosene that seems so mysterious to a five-year-old? Remnant of the past, this brass lantern lights up memories and burns with nostalgia.
