driven camera. Various color schemes, camera speeds and roll are available.

This is a extension of my ZofzPCB 3D Gerber Viewer by a screensaver front-end.
Beside above settings, there is a possibility of showing any other PCB if
gerber files are provided. To do this create and save a project file in the
