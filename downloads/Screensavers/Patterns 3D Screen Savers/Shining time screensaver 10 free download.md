**Publisher's Description**  
  

A 3D rotating clock screensaver. This screensaver has the capability to save
power during rendering of frames. It is achieved by a special usage of GPU and
CPU (GPU is used only during drawing of the next frame and CPU usage is very
small as 3D transformations are very simple and they depend only on timer).

**System requirements:**

  * CPU at least Intel Pentium III or Compatible 
  * RAM: 128Mb or more 
  * Video: At least support OpenGL1.1 (DirectX 6.0) required 
  * OS: Windows 9x, Me, NT, 2000, XP
