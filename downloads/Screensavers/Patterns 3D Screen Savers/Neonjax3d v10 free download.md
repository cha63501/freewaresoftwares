NeonJax3D is a software-rendered 3D screensaver demo which supports stereo LCD
glasses. It features a cool color-changing plasma background and an object
consisting of 1,000 Points of Light, in addition to traditional polygon
objects. This version only contains the screen saver but there are free tools
available elsewhere for creating your own 3D demos with NeonJax3D and sharing
them with your friends.
