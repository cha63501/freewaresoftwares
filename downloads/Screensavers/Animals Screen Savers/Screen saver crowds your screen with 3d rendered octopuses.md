**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Octo-screensaver has 3D-rendered graphics made with POV-Ray (tm). Cartoonish octos move over your screen in their own typical fashion. You can choose to let them swim over a black background or over your desktop. Add an underwaterish look by making your desktop blue. 

**Options:**

  * Desktop / Black screen: use your desk top as background or leave it black. 
  * Shadow: draws a shadow behind the octos. Only works with the desktop as background. 
  * Blue: makes the desktop blue. Only works with the desktop as background.
