This screensaver has 30 pictures of giant windmills as they can still be found in the Netherlands, for example in Kinderdijk! 

A windmill is an energy generator powered by the wind. These giants have been around since the 12th century. The energy windmills produce can be used in many ways. Traditionally for grinding grain or spices, later they were also used for pumping water, hammering seeds or sawing wood.
