The SnowFall screen saver displays a shower of snowflakes that drift across your monitor. 

Configuration options are available that can be used to change the way the screen saver looks to suit your own preferences.

The snowflake images are taken from the collection of images photographed by Wilson A. Bentley, and very beautiful they are too. The screen saver itself is based on the Snowfall screen saver for the Mac.
