**Publisher's Description**  
  


Bring a beautiful classic Nativity to your desktop. Hand-painted scenery comes to life with animated characters: Mary and Joseph attend the baby Jesus while sheep and donkey watch from their stalls. Candlelight flickers in Bethlehem and the guiding star shines above. An original a cappella version of Silent Night completes the scene. This free version only includes one scene.
