**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ripples is a screen saver for Microsoft Windows, which puts life into static backgrounds. Suitable for Ripples are pictures with a large water surface which can be animated. 

**Settings:**  
A wide range of settings affects e.g. wave direction, wave count, wave frequency and wave amplitude (please see the screenshot of the settings dialog).

**Profiles:**  
In order to use different settings for different background images, Ripples is able to create profiles. A profile contains all settings you can adjust in the user interface. Are profile and background image named identically, Ripples will load both - the background image and the matching profile - automatically.

**Equipment:**  
Ripples is already equipped with a few different backgrounds, that come with matching profiles. So you can use the screensaver immediately.

**Creativity:**  
Ripples has a flexible user interface, which you can use to animate nearly every image. In other "Ripple-like-savers" you can often only choose between a few selected backgrounds. With Ripples you are able to load in and modify (for instance) your own photos. In some respects every user can so create his own screensaver individually with a few clicks.
