**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bring a beautiful classic Nativity to your desktop. Hand-painted scenery comes
to life with animated characters: Mary and Joseph attend the baby Jesus while
sheep and donkey watch from their stalls. Candlelight flickers in Bethlehem
and the guiding star shines above. An original a cappella version of Silent
Night completes the scene. This free version only includes one scene.
