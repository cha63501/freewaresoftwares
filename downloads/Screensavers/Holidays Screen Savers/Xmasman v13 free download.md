The SuperHero from SuperSaver returns in disguise in this cosy XMas
screensaver, disguised as Santa, popping up from a screen full of Xmas trees.  
Optional snow, 47 songs to pick from and the new Xmas Joy option bring
Christmas to your desktop.  
You can start with plain or snowy trees, or let the trees get covered by snow
gradually. ThereA's a collection of 47 Xmas tunes you can choose from. The
screensaver plays them continuously in a random order.

New in v1.3 is the Xmas Joy option, which gives a slightly more cheerful
impression with Santa jumping all over the place.
