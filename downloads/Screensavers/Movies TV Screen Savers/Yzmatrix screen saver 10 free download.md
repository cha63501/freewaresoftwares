**Publisher's Description**  
  

Matrix is one of my favorite SF movies. The Matrix idea of people living in an
illusory world is quite appealing to me, a guy who is well read in Buddhism
and Hinduism. As a programmer, I always wanted to reproduce this scrolling
text effects on my computer. Then I discovered xmatrix by Jamie Zawinski.
However, itA's Linux only. So one day, I decided to write one of my own for
the Windows platform. The fonts used here are borrowed from xmatrix.

YZMatrix Screen Saver will reproduce the Matrix scrolling text effects on your
computer.
