**Publisher's Description**  
  

PixName is an application for the management of digital pictures and movies,
with easy renaming of picture files and a query system to locate pictures.

Use PixName to download pictures from your camera directly into dated folders,
automatically generated in a clear structure, for access by year or by theme.
Rename and prepare pictures for email, arrange pictures in a precise order and
display them in slide shows. All without modifying your pictures.

PixName was specifically designed to cut down typing and avoid unnecessary
repetitions in renaming pictures.

Renaming pictures does away with cluttered with meaningless files. After
renaming, you can search for "Mount Rainier" with any search program, or with
your file manager. No need to to plod from P1010001 to P1010086 to find the
picture of Mount Rainier. With commercial printers which print file names on
the back of pictures you have free integrated captions.

Pixname slide shows display picture file names so you know what you see. They
also give you full control - automatic or manual - over the show.

PixName can create "light" versions of your pictures, ready to be attached to
email. Each mailed picture comes with its file name so that both you and the
receivers of your pictures know what the pictures are about.

PixName operates in English and French, and has the capacity to integrate
other languages.
