**Publisher's Description**  
  

Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as
diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. Automatic graph drawing has many
important applications in software engineering, database and web design,
networking, and in visual interfaces for many other domains.

Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. It has several main
graph layout programs. See the gallery for some sample layouts. It also has
web and interactive graphical interfaces, and auxiliary tools, libraries, and
language bindings.

The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text
language, and make diagrams in several useful formats such as images and SVG
for web pages, Postscript for inclusion in PDF or other documents; or display
in an interactive graph browser. (Graphviz also supports GXL, an XML dialect.)

Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for
colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom
shapes.

In practice, graphs are usually generated from an external data sources, but
they can also be created and edited manually, either as raw text files or
within a graphical editor. (Graphviz was not intended to be a Visio
replacement, so it is probably frustrating to try to use it that way.)
