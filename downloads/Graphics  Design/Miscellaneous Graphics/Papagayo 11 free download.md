**Publisher's Description**  
  

Papagayo is a lip-syncing program designed to help you line up phonemes (mouth
shapes) with the actual recorded sound of actors speaking. Papagayo makes it
easy to lip sync animated characters by making the process very simple - just
type in the words being spoken (or copy/paste them from the animationA's
script), then drag the words on top of the soundA's waveform until they line
up with the proper sounds.

After syncing up mouth shapes with actual sounds, Papagayo can then export the
result for use with Moho, our 2D animation product.

Papagayo is free to download and use. Sync A'till your virtual lips are sore!
Papagayo is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Download the Linux and MacOS versions from the [developerA's
website](http://www.lostmarble.com/papagayo/index.shtml).
