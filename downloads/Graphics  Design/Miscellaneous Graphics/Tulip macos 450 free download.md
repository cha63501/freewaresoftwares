Tulip is an information visualization framework dedicated to the analysis and
visualization of relational data. Tulip aims to provide the developer with a
complete library, supporting the design of interactive information
visualization applications for relational data that can be tailored to the
problems he or she is addressing.

Written in C++ the framework enables the development of algorithms, visual
encodings, interaction techniques, data models, and domain-specific
visualizations. One of the goal of Tulip is to facilitates the reuse of
components and allows the developers to focus on programming their
