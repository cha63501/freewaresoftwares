**Publisher's Description**  
  

Photo Caption Creator 2.0 lets you add unlimited caption to either the bottom
of the a Jpeg image on on the image itself. A spell check is included. Pick
and Point here feature. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a few
words added to that image must be worth millions.

To add even more to the image, the program also can update the image
Description (Exif) tag. This tag is embedded In the header of the Jpeg image.
What that means is you can add a description of the image such as who is in
the picture, what they are doing, year of the picture, etc. And, every copy of
the image you send out will have that story (description) until itA's changed.

Since this information is embedded in the image, it is not normally seen. It
will be passed on with out being changed. In the future, use of the image
description Tag will be used more.
