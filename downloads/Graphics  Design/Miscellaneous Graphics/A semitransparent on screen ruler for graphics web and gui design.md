**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program is a semi-transparent on-screen ruler to help you lay out GUIs and Web pages or measure anything on your screen in 5 units. 

Intuitive keyboard shortcuts allow you to precisely position the ruler anywhere on the screen. Both fine and gross positioning shortcuts are available. The ruler may be pinned to any edge of the screen or moved 1 pixel at a time using the keyboard shortcuts. Measuring is simple - just drag the ruler to the item you wish to measure and move the cursor to the other end to measure it. A marker tracks the mouse and the ruler displays the measurement. Additionally, double clicking the ruler resets the length of the nearest side. 

Transparency can be finely controlled using keyboard shortcuts and the ruler can be "skeletonized", making everything but the edges and the markings completely transparent. Units can be set using the mouse scroll wheel. The ruler can be calibrated in either direction using a physical ruler. Extensive customization options are available by Right-clicking. The colour of the ruler background, edges, ticks and font can be set individually. The ruler saves its settings upon exit, so it always looks the way you configured it last. 

The program installer comes with a built in uninstaller. There is also a portable version (visit the help pages). It is safe for work, since it does not modify your computerA's registry. 

The latest version searches for an update upon start up (if configured to do so) and gives you the option to download the latest version. The program has extensive web help pages at http://sites.google.com/site/rulerhelp/.
