Graph Extract is a program for digitizing plots. Using either manual or
automated approaches, this program provides a means to easily extract numeric
data from plots. The resulting X-Y data can be printed or replotted, or it can
be saved in Excel file format for further processing.

The program works with linear, log or log-log plots. Graphs can be loaded as
bitmaps or scanned from hardcopy from within the program.
