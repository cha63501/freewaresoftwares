Picture Resizer is an easy-to-use tool for batch resizing of JPG pictures and
photos. Drag and drop JPG files or folders with JPG files on the application

  * PhotoResize_400.exe - minimum side 400 pixels. 
  * PhotoResizeF400x300.exe - frame size of 400x300 pixels. The resulting image width will be smaller or equal to 400 and its height will be smaller or equal to 300 pixels. 
  * PhotoResizeW400.exe - width set to 400 pixels. Height automatically computed to keep aspect ratio. 
  * PhotoResizeH400.exe - height set to 400 pixels. Width automatically computed to keep aspect ratio. 
  * PhotoResizeP50.exe - resize to 50%. 
  * PhotoResize400x300.exe - resize to exactly 400x300 pixels. Aspect ratio is not preserved. 
  * PhotoResizeD100.exe - resize to 100DPI. Physical size stays the same. 
  * PhotoResizeD100T.exe - overwrite the resolution information in the header without touching the pixels. 
  * PhotoResizeK20.exe - resize to approximate maximum size of 20kB. 
  * PhotoResizeG1024x768.exe - use content-aware resizing to change aspect ratio while preserving content. 
  * PhotoResizeA400x300.exe - crop and resize to 400x300 pixels. The central part is preserved and resized while the borders are cropped. 
  * PhotoResizeA400x300x5.exe - extend canvas and resize to 400x300 pixels. The last number (0-9) controls canvas brightness. 

**WhatA's New in version 6.0:**

  * Limit processing to landscape (width >= height) or portrait (height Rotate pictures by EXIF orientation tag while resizing them with PhotoResize400V.exe. 
  * Higher accuracy resampling method improves quality in darker areas. 
  * Support for JPEG arithmetic compression for both decoding and encoding. PhotoResize400A.exe creates JPEGs with arithmetic compression. Please note that very few applications support arithmetic compression at this moment, but probably will in the future, because the patents have recently expired. Arithmetic encoding reduces file size by ~10% while keeping the same quality.
