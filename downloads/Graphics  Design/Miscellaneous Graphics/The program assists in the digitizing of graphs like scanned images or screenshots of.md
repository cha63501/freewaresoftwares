**Publisher's Description**  
  


The program aims to offer assistance in the digitizing of graphs, i.e. recovering the tabulated X-Y dependence that the graph represents. This is the frequently required task when the original numerical data is not available. Common examples are scanned images taken of paper documents and screen shots taken of electronic media. Manual as well as (semi)automatic digitizing is possible. While only rectangular coordinate system is supported, the image can be rotated to achieve precise alignment of axes. The recovered and properly formatted data points can be saved to a text file or copied to clipboard. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
