**Publisher's Description**  
  

With hundreds of plug-in filters now available for expanding your host
applications, it becomes essential to have a quick and easy way of organising
all the installed files. Plug-In Switch was developed in order to help users
disable filters on a temporary basis and re-enable them again when needed,
without having to completely uninstall the plug-ins each time. Another handy
time-saving tool.

This version currently supports 3 different types of plug-ins:

  * Photoshop (*.8bf) : The most common image-editing format 
  * Premiere (*.prm) : Add-on filters for video-editing 
  * After Effects (*.aex) : More common video-editing filters 

Remember, you must use Plug-In Switch BEFORE running your host application for
the settings to take effect. Do NOT try to enable or disable filters while
your host program is running!

**Features:**

  * Disable plug-ins when not needed 
  * Make space in your filter menu 
  * Re-enable plug-ins at any time 
  * Twin pane layout for easy of use 
  * Use with Photoshop plug-ins 
  * Also compatible with video filters
