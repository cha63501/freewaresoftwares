**Publisher's Description**  
  

imgKlone is a simple application designed to make grabbing images, resampling
and saving them as easy as possible. Images can be acquired by dragging,
copying or capturing. If it can be seen, it can be grabbed. If itA's a file it
can be dropped.

imgKlone is ideal when you want to quickly copy something from your screen and
email it. Or reduce that image file to a reasonable size for emailing. WYSIWYG
resizing makes it real easy to re-size an image to fit exactly that space on
your web page. Quickly convert between common image formats. imgKlone can also
be used as a loupe to zoom a section of the screen for a better view. It is
also useful if you want to temporarily hold some information.

imgKlone is fully portable and can be run from a flash drive.
