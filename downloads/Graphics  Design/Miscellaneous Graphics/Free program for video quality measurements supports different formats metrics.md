Free program for video quality measurements. Supports different input formats (AVI, AVS, YUV, BMP) and metrics (PSNR, Delta, VQM, SSIM, MSU Blurring / Blocking Measure).

  * Everybody in 5 minutes is able to demonstrate that one codec is better than another! It's easy: 
    1. Set "comparative analysis" and select original, sequences compressed with codec A and codec B (recommended more than 10000 frames). 
    2. Select metric (recommended Y-PSNR). 
    3. Select "Save bad frames" pairs of frames with maximum difference in values of the metric (A>B) will be detected and saved. 
    4. Press "Process", find output frames and select best pairs. 
    5. Upload frames to your favorite forum. 
    6. Done! 
  * If you want to prove, that codec B is better than A just swap compressed files in metric form fields. :) Codec and filter developers can use this feature for tuning (fast codec/filter update testing). 
  * Plug-ins interface gives user possibility to create their own metrics. 
  * Masking (calculation of a metric for the part of a frame)
