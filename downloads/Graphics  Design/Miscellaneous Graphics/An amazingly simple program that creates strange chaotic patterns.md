**Publisher's Description**  
  


An "ant" is walking across a two-dimensional array of bits. If the bit the ant steps on is 0 (color 2) the ant turns left. If the bit is 1 (color 1) the ant turns right. The bit the ant has just left will be inverted. 

These simple rules lead to different intermediate patterns. But after a while it all ends up in chaos.
