**Publisher's Description**  
  

"A picture is worth a thousand words" is a phrase we would all understand.
However, sometimes a few words of explanation may be required before everyone
can understand which "thousand words" the picture refers to!

This is a simple application that can add those "few words". Load the image,
resize and rotate it as necessary, add the words and save an image that can
now make greater sense to anyone coming across it. Do it when you transfer
those images from camera to disk - resize the image to a more handleable size
and add a title in one easy and quick operation.

You can add the title to the image or create an area around the image to add a
title. Combining the resize options and rotation you can create a variety of
displayed images with text. You can crop the image if required.

It can also be used to add watermark text to an image or to create a text only
image.

The application will accept a wide range of image formats but only save as a
JPEG, PNG, Bitmap, GIF or Metafile. JPEG and PNG images are saved in default
quality.

**WhatA's New in version 2.0:**

  * Significant changes in use and the addition of more options for added text and image background. 
  * A major change is the addition of a floating menu/options window which is opened from the popup menu. Items in the popup menu are parralled in the Floating Menu. The floating window and the ability to restore the previous image, makes it easier to experiment with options. 
  * The addition of an optional gradient background and font decoration are simple additions but easy to use.
