Avatar Sizer resizes your image and creates a JPG file suitable for use as a Forum Avatar. The Aspect Ratio of the image is retained when the image is resized so it looks the same, just smaller. 

Avatar Sizer is exceptionally easy to use and can convert most of the popular image types into an Avatar.

So, for example, if youA've taken a picture with your digital camera or camera phone, you can turn it into an Avatar.
