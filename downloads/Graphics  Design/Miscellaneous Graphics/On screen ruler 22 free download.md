**Publisher's Description**  
  

This program is a semi-transparent on-screen ruler to help you lay out GUIs
and Web pages or measure anything on your screen in 5 units.

Intuitive keyboard shortcuts allow you to precisely position the ruler
anywhere on the screen. Both fine and gross positioning shortcuts are
available. The ruler may be pinned to any edge of the screen or moved 1 pixel
at a time using the keyboard shortcuts. Measuring is simple - just drag the
ruler to the item you wish to measure and move the cursor to the other end to
measure it. A marker tracks the mouse and the ruler displays the measurement.
Additionally, double clicking the ruler resets the length of the nearest side.

Transparency can be finely controlled using keyboard shortcuts and the ruler
can be "skeletonized", making everything but the edges and the markings
completely transparent. Units can be set using the mouse scroll wheel. The
ruler can be calibrated in either direction using a physical ruler. Extensive
customization options are available by Right-clicking. The colour of the ruler
background, edges, ticks and font can be set individually. The ruler saves its
settings upon exit, so it always looks the way you configured it last.

The program installer comes with a built in uninstaller. There is also a
portable version (visit the help pages). It is safe for work, since it does
not modify your computerA's registry.

The latest version searches for an update upon start up (if configured to do
so) and gives you the option to download the latest version. The program has
extensive web help pages at http://sites.google.com/site/rulerhelp/.
