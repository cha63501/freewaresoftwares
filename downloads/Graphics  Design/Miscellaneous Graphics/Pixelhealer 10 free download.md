**Publisher's Description**  
  

PixelHealer is a free program to fix dead, stuck or hot pixels on LCD or TFT
screens, on desktop monitors, laptops or tablets.

Run PixelHealer, cover the dead pixel with the colored repair window, and
click Start Flashing. PixelHealer uses the already tested concept that
flashing RGB colors over a dead or stuck pixel will revive it. So let the
repair window run for a while, then check to see if the dead pixel has been
fixed or revived. And repeat the process if necessary.

PixelHealer has an intuitive interface and it is very easy to use. Use the
mouse or your finger to move or resize the repair window. Open the intuitive
Settings window to change the flashing colors, the flashing interval, or to
automatically close the app after a certain period of time.

PixelHealer requires no installation: simply download and run.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
