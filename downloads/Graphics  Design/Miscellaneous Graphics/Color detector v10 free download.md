**Publisher's Description**  
  

Do you ever see a nice color used on a web site, picture, graphic,
application, etc... and want to know the RGB or the HTML hex code of that
color? Color Detector allows you to find out just that!

Simply point the mouse cursor anywhere on the screen, and the application will
tell you: the RGB code, the HTML hex code, and the name of the color in plain
english, of the pixel where the mouse is pointing. It can also copy the HTML
hex code to the clipboard.
