**Publisher's Description**  
  

BoxMaker is a three dimensional virtual packaging design tool. It transforms
your image artwork into a 3D box in real time using the OpenGL library
supported by your PCAs graphics hardware, allowing you to rapidly prototype
your packaging designs. You can easily select the cover images, rotate, pan
and zoom your box in real-time. 3D Box Shot can then write high quality bitmap
images of your box which can be edited for inclusion on your web site or in
promotional literature.

BoxMaker can also be used to display three dimensionally rotated image.
