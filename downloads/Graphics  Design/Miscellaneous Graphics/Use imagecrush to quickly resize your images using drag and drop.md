**Publisher's Description**  
  


I love digital cameras - take some pictures, keep the ones you like, delete the ones you dont, download them to your computer and youA're all set to send them to your friends or upload them to your website or blog. 

But these days digital cameras are creating huge image files - great for printing maybe, but your friends wont appreciate it when youA've filled their inbox with 25meg of pictures, or they are waiting 15 minutes for your blog to load just because you didnA't resize the picture files before you used them.

ImageCrush gives you a quick and easy way to create resized copies of your original image files that are in more inbox and web friendly file sizes, without the time consuming hassle and confusion thats usually involved when using an expensive photo editing package - after all, why waste time manipulating your images when you can be using your time to take more photos instead?!

  * Use drag and drop to quickly and easily resize your images using high quality filtering and interpolation algorithms
  * Choose from a range of predefined sizes/resolutions and JEPG quality settings using simple drop-down toolbar menus, or choose your own
  * Make ImageCrunch "always on top" so you dont lose it under a stack of other windows when youA're finding your image files
  * Resize all major image formats - JPG, BMP, GIF or PNG
**New in version 1.1**

ImageCrush has undergone a few little changes to make it more useful. Now not only do you have the simple convert to a resolution, now you can convert by a percentage too. So now if you just want your images to be say 20% of the original size for example, you dont have to think about how big that is in pixels! Just select a preset percentage scale or specify your own. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
