**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bad Peggy searches for damaged JPEG files and will validate and verify
pictures for truncation and other blemishes which sometimes occur when such
files are getting downloaded or restored from bad backups.

ItA's quite useful for example to check if your precious photo library is
still all intact - and itA's fast, comfortable to use and reliable in the
analysis it does.

Please notice that the installer might need to download the Microsoft .NET
Framework v2.0 if it hasnA't been installed on your system already.
