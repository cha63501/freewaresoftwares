Tulip is an information visualization framework dedicated to the analysis and
visualization of relational data. Tulip aims to provide the developer with a
complete library, supporting the design of interactive information
visualization applications for relational data that can be tailored to the
problems he or she is addressing.

Written in C++ the framework enables the development of algorithms, visual
encodings, interaction techniques, data models, and domain-specific
visualizations. One of the goal of Tulip is to facilitates the reuse of
components and allows the developers to focus on programming their
application. This development pipeline makes the framework efficient for
research prototyping as well as the development of end-user applications.
