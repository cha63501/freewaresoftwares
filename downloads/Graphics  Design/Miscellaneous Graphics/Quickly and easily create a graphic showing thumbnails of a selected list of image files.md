**Publisher's Description**  
  


Using ImgStrips, you can quickly and easily create a graphic showing thumbnails of a selected list of image files. Optionally, an html file with a basic image map can be created and saved with the graphic. The original aim in writing ImgStrips was to provide a simple means of creating a A'menuA' front page for a CD of images, where clicking on a thumbnail will bring up the full size image. 

A multi thumbnail graphic can be particularly useful in providing lots of visual information in a single file. For example, sending a selection of image files by email is less efficient than sending a single file. A single file of thumbnail images will download quicker than an equivalent html grid of individual images.

Client side image maps seem to have become less popular since the development of script options and the improvements made in presenting a web page. However the map tag is basic HTML and requires nothing more to work than a browser. The html file created by this application contains an image map that will show the original image file when a thumbnail is clicked. However the map tag has a variety of attributes and can be easily amended to produce a different output.
