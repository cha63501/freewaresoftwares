**Publisher's Description**  
  

ImageIngester is an application that transfers images from your camera or card
to your computer.

**Features:**

  * Automatically copies images to backup folder, freshly created and named for each ingestion (e.g., "IMG_2006-02-26_17.53.55"). 
  * Automatically runs Adobe DNG Converter (optional); original raw kept in backup folder. JPEG previews and embedded raws in DNGs optional, too. 
  * Files named according to the scheme you set (e.g., MJR_20060304_1234.DNG). 
  * File modification times (even for DNGs) set to match corresponding times on card. (Modification time of file on card to the secondAalmost always close to, but not necessarily identical to, EXIF Date Time, Date Time Original, and Date Time Digitized.) 
  * Automatically adds metadata from a template that you choose from a convenient drop-down menu (see screen shot, below). 
  * JPEGs verified after copying (DNG Converter verifies raws). Option to have DNG Converter verify raws without converting to DNG. 
  * Choice of folder arrangements in primary folder: by date (1 level); by year and date (2 levels); and by year, month, and date (3 levels); by a name you set yourself; and by number-range. 
  * Automatically runs viewer (e.g., Adobe Bridge) after ingestion (optional). 
  * Option to start ingestion automatically when card is inserted, and eject card automatically when ingestion is completed. 
  * All errors and status messages reported on screen. See screen shot, below. 
  * Can launch automatically when camera or card mounts (set via Image Capture application or AutoPlay settings).
