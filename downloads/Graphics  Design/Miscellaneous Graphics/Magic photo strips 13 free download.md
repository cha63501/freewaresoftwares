**Publisher's Description**  
  

Magic Photo Strips is an application to create photo strips from JPEG files -
multiple photo images consolidated into a single image, sometimes referred to
as thumbnails. Not just a viewer but an application to create impressive
images and prints. It can also uniquely create an image map file with the
photo strip so that clicking on a thumbnail will open the original full size
image.

Photo strips have many uses. Whether you need a thumbnail view of photos to
send somewhere or you fancy a photo-booth type strip of funny faces or you
want to create a more interesting visual index for a collection of images,
Magic Photo Strips is the application you need.

Magic Photo Strips is flexible and simplicity to use.

**WhatA's New in version 1.3:**

  * This update resolves a memory leak and uses a faster memory manager to improve operation. Previous versions of mps.exe should be replacing with this update. 
  * The interface has been tidied up.
