**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pastry allows you to store graphic clipboard content into a image file and paste a reference to that file in one single key stroke. 

Normally Pastry does itA's work behind the scenes. It introduces two new hot keys. CTRL ALT V to paste a path and file name to the image file representing your clipboard content. CTRL SHIFT V pastes a URL to the image (At this stage only useful when you have a local web-server).

Pastry is a modest but very useful tool when you often need to share, email or publish images or pieces of images. 

You really need to read the entire description on the publishers web-site to appreciate the Pastry capabilities.

Pastry is free of adware.
