**Publisher's Description**  
  

PIXresizer is a tool for quickly generating screen-friendly versions of your
images with dramatically reduced file sizes. It is a photo resizing program
that enables you to quickly resize one file or a selection of image files for
use on the web and in e-mail. The reduced files are saved in a different
directory, so your original pictures are not changed.

The program offers several different resizing methods to choose from and can
automatically recognize image sizes to calculate the best fit. PIXresizer
includes a built-in image viewer and you can also convert between graphics
formats: it opens and saves in .bmp, .gif, .jpg, .png, and .tif formats. A
great companion for webmasters and digital photographers.

**WhatA's new in version 2.0.6:**

  * New: Editable source and destination folders (use shift + click), Help file now in PDF format, compatibility fix for 64bit systems.
