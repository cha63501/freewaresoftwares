**Publisher's Description**  
  


FractalViewer generates high quality, anti-aliased images of fractals such as the Mandelbrot set. Zooming in on an image is easy - just drag a box around the part of the image you want to see. A number of automatically generated palette styles are provided, as well as control over the size of the palette. By default, the image is generated progressively so you can see it being built up, although this can be turned off for greater speed. 

As well as the Mandelbrot set, which is probably the most famous fractal image, a number of other fractals can be generated. FractalViewer provides control over various parameters to allow a huge variety of images to be generated.

In addition to showing the images interactively in the application window, FractalViewer can generate images at any resolution and export them as JPEG files.
