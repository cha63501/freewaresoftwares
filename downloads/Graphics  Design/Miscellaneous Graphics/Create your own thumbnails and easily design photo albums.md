**Publisher's Description**  
  


OscarA's JPEG Thumb-Maker is an application that will help you create your own thumbnails and easy design photo albums. 

The software will always take care to protect the aspect ratio of the images, no matter what. While you set some desired size, some images could not be perfectly resized to it since their ratio may be different.

For example if the source is 1600x1200 then the image may be perfectly resized to 640x480 without anything else since both have the same W/H ratio. However if your desired size would be 600x400 then such image canA't be resized without changing the ratio - which we donA't want.
