**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program is for drawing graphs of mathematical functions in a coordinate system. Graphs may be added with different color and line styles. Both standard functions and parameter functions are supported. It is possible to evaluate a function at an entered point or tracing the function with the mouse. Tangents and shades may be added to the functions, and point series with trendlines may be added to the coordinate system.
