**Publisher's Description**  
  


ChaosPro is an MDI fractal generator compatible to FractInt and UltraFractal. It can read FractIntA's *.par, *.frm, *.ifs, *.l and *.map files, and UltraFractalA's *.upr, *.uxf, *.ufm and *.ucl files. 

It is completely based on 24 bit and thus can create smooth true color images. Its palette editor lets you have full control over the colors.

With its keyframing technique and its spline interpolation algorithm it can create smooth (AVI) animations of any parameter. It can 3D transform 2D fractals (height fields). 

You can write your own formulas using the built in language, which gets compiled in realtime into ready to run optmized machine code. The compiler natively knows about complex and quaternion numbers, which enables it to produce Quaternions (true 3D fractals).

ChaosPro has support for layers (similar to Photoshop) which allows you to merge different fractals and thus to combine coloring modes.

**WhatA's New in version 4.0.249:**

  * Several bugs fixed
