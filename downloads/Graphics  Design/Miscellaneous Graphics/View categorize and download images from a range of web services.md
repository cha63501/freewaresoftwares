**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Image Collector (referred to as TIC) is an application that has been designed to allow the quick viewing, categorization, and downloading of images from a range of web services. 

TIC allows you to choose the web service you would like to download from, fetches the latest available images and displays their thumbnails in a scrollable grid. You can then left-click an image to download and display its full version; if you want to keep that image, middle-click on it and it will be downloaded to the selected category.

Categories point to a location on disk, so you can activate a category and download an image, and itA'll be automatically placed into that categoryA's location. This, combined with queued downloading, allows images to be downloaded and categorised very quickly. There is no need to wait for images to complete downloading before viewing and downloading more.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773). 

**WhatA's New in version 1.08:**

  * [Fixed] Using .NET 4.5 results in a crash at startup; now TIC will warn that it requires 4.5.1. 
  * [Fixed] Plugins/Services weren't being found in Windows Vista.
