**Publisher's Description**  
  

Commenting a JPEG can be useful. IA've seen it described as the equivalent of
writing on the back of a photograph. It doesnA't effect showing the image and
is not normally seen unless looked for.

This small application is a JPEG comments editor. It can run from the context
menu and it can also accept a dropped JPEG file. It can show the image and add
or edit existing comments.

**WhatA's New in version 1.2:**

  * Can process Read-only files and save a JPEG as Read-only
