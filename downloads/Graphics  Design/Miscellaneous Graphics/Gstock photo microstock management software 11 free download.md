**Publisher's Description**  
  

Earn money with your photos. With GStock Photo Microstock Management Software
you can tag all your images easily, and upload them to the most popular
microstock agencies.

Microstock photography (or micropayment photography) is a part of the stock
photography industry. Microstock agencies source their images almost
exclusively via the Internet, and sell their images at low rate compared to
traditional stock agencies.

But since the images are sold globally, you can earn a lot of money with your
photographs. Some contributors make a living by selling images via microstock
agencies.
