**Publisher's Description**  
  

PicName is a donation-ware program that makes it easy to do the things you
might commonly do right after loading digital camera files (pictures/photos
and videos) onto your PC. PicName allows you to easily rename, rotate, delete,
resize, and change format of image and/or video files. It was designed to let
you perform these operations very efficiently, with the minimum number of
keystrokes or mouse clicks.

PicNameA's greatest strength is that it is very easy to step down through the
files one by one, preview them, and then rename, rotate, and/or delete each
one. For the keyboard-inclined, these operations can all be done without using
the mouse, and with a minimum number of keystrokes. PicName also allows you to
select multiple files at once and rename, rotate, or delete them. PicNameA's
powerful renaming capabilities include auto-completion during name editing,
automatic name collision avoidance, append/prepend date-time or other text,
variable substitution, remove text, replace text, fill down, etc. Another of
PicNameA's strengths is a full Undo/Redo capability that allows you to safely
perform these operations.
