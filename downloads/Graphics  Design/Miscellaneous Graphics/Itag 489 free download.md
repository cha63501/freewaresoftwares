**Publisher's Description**  
  

iTag is a free tool that allows you to easily add title, description and
keyword tags to your digital photos. The data you enter is stored into the
actual photo file itself - using the open standard of IPTC. Many applications
can read/write the IPTC data, but iTag is especially powerful at editing a
group of photos all at once.

Geocoding your photos is also straight forward by drag and dropping Google
Earth placemarks (*.kml, *.kmz). An even faster way is to simply copy a
placemark to the clipboard, which iTag can detect. When geocoding, the data
can optionally be saved as IPTC tags (FlickrFly style), to the EXIF fields, or
both.

Photos geocoded with WWMX Location Stamper are also recognised and can be
viewed in Google Earth. Groups of photos can be selected and viewed in Google
Earth.

There is also an option to convert GPX tracklogs to Google Earth format.
