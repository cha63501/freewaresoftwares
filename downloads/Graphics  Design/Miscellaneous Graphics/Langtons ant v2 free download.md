**Publisher's Description**  
  

An "ant" is walking across a two-dimensional array of bits. If the bit the ant
steps on is 0 (color 2) the ant turns left. If the bit is 1 (color 1) the ant
turns right. The bit the ant has just left will be inverted.

These simple rules lead to different intermediate patterns. But after a while
it all ends up in chaos.
