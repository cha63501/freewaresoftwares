BoxMaker is a three dimensional virtual packaging design tool. It transforms your image artwork into a 3D box in real time using the OpenGL library supported by your PCAs graphics hardware, allowing you to rapidly prototype your packaging designs. You can easily select the cover images, rotate, pan and zoom your box in real-time. 3D Box Shot can then write high quality bitmap images of your box which can be edited for inclusion on your web site or in promotional literature. 

BoxMaker can also be used to display three dimensionally rotated image.
