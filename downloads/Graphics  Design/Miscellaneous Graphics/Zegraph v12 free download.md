**Publisher's Description**  
  

zeGraph is a freeware designed for scientific data visualization and yet can
be used to create 3D arts in a broad scope. It is small, fast, and relatively
easy to use. The core library is written in C++ for high performance. OpenGL
is used as the rendering engine. This distribution is a binding of zeGraph to
Lua, which is a platform independent, light weighted, simple, and powerful
script language.
