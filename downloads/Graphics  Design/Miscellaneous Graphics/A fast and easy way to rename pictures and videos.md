**Publisher's Description**  
  


PicName is a donation-ware program that makes it easy to do the things you might commonly do right after loading digital camera files (pictures/photos and videos) onto your PC. PicName allows you to easily rename, rotate, delete, resize, and change format of image and/or video files. It was designed to let you perform these operations very efficiently, with the minimum number of keystrokes or mouse clicks. 

PicNameA's greatest strength is that it is very easy to step down through the files one by one, preview them, and then rename, rotate, and/or delete each one. For the keyboard-inclined, these operations can all be done without using the mouse, and with a minimum number of keystrokes. PicName also allows you to select multiple files at once and rename, rotate, or delete them. PicNameA's powerful renaming capabilities include auto-completion during name editing, automatic name collision avoidance, append/prepend date-time or other text, variable substitution, remove text, replace text, fill down, etc. Another of PicNameA's strengths is a full Undo/Redo capability that allows you to safely perform these operations.
