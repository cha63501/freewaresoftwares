**Publisher's Description**  
  

XenoFlow is an open source Windows application that collects, stores, and
retrieves information about audio and video files. It can identify the
characteristics of a wide variety of multimedia files and quickly locate files
from a large collection of discs that have been cataloged.

The disc cataloging and tracking features help index files for large
collections of audio and video files on different media. After a disc
containing files has been imported into the database the built in browser and
search tools can be used to locate and retrieve the stored information.
XenoFlow is designed to collect as much useful information describing a file
as possible with the least amount of manual effort.

XenoFlow also functions like other codec identification tools as it can
identify charatecteristcs about an individual A/V file. The additional benefit
is that after the file has been imported the results are stored in the
database for viewing at any later point in time.
