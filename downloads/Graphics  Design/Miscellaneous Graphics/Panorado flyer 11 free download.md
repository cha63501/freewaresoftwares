**Publisher's Description**  
  

Panorado Flyer is a small, yet very useful tool for linking JPEG image files
to the location where the picture was taken, using geographical coordinates.

JPEG image files can contain supplementary information (so-called Metadata).

Technical metadata as described by the EXIF standard can contain fields for
GPS data, like geographical latitude/longitude, altitude, and track. The
Panorado Flyer tool enables you to get the coordinates of the place where the
picture was shot and insert them into these fields.

You can do it manually, using a dialog window.

Or, if you have installed the Google Earth client (can be downloaded for
free), you can search for the location there, drag it to the center of the map
window, then change to Panorado flyer, grab the coordinates and insert them
into the image selected, without typing any numbers.

Or, if your camera is able to save the location right with the image - fine!
(Only supported by a few brands.)

Later - on a few mouseclicks again - you can make Google Earth "fly" you to
the location!

Panorado Flyer has been implemented as a so-called shell extension. I. e., you
right-click on a JPEG image within the Windows Explorer to bring up the
context menu, then select "Panorado Flyer", and then a submenu command.
