**Publisher's Description**  
  

Using ImgStrips, you can quickly and easily create a graphic showing
thumbnails of a selected list of image files. Optionally, an html file with a
basic image map can be created and saved with the graphic. The original aim in
writing ImgStrips was to provide a simple means of creating a A'menuA' front
page for a CD of images, where clicking on a thumbnail will bring up the full
size image.

A multi thumbnail graphic can be particularly useful in providing lots of
visual information in a single file. For example, sending a selection of image
files by email is less efficient than sending a single file. A single file of
thumbnail images will download quicker than an equivalent html grid of
individual images.

Client side image maps seem to have become less popular since the development
of script options and the improvements made in presenting a web page. However
the map tag is basic HTML and requires nothing more to work than a browser.
The html file created by this application contains an image map that will show
the original image file when a thumbnail is clicked. However the map tag has a
variety of attributes and can be easily amended to produce a different output.
