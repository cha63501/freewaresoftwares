**Publisher's Description**  
  


Batch Image Processor allows you to resize or process a whole directory of images at once. 

**Processing Options:**

  * **Blur Edges:** You can blur (fade) the edges of an image to either white or black. This is great if your image has an edge which jars with your background. I use this effect a lot on this site, especially on my post about Fighting Robots. 
  * **Resize:** Allows you to specify a new height/width. If just one of these is set, then the other is automatically set to keep the image in proportion to its original size. IE - if the original image was 200A100 and you set the new width to be 50, then the height will be automatically set to 25. 
  * **Quality:** You can adjust the quality of the new image, which affects the size in KB. The default is 100%
