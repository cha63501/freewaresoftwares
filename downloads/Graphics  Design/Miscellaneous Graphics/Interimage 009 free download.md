**Publisher's Description**  
  

The InterImage system is a knowledge based framework for Automatic Image
Interpretation. InterImage is an extension of an earlier project called
GeoAIDA developed by the Insitut fA1/4r Informationsverarbeitung - Leibniz
UniversitA$?t Hannover. The interpretation strategy implemented by the system
is based on a knowledge model defined by the user, structured as a semantic
network. The nodes of the network represent concepts, classes of image objects
expected to be found in a scene. Specialized image processing operators
(external from the systemA's core) can be attached to the system, which
controls their execution. The instances of the concepts found by the operators
are then judged by the system, based on rules defined by the user.

The InteImage environment will permit the construction of automatic image
interpretation systems, through the modeling of the knowledge by the
specialist. Some functionalities that the system will provide are:

  * Extraction of objects/patterns in images and calculation of spectral, geometric, topological and texture properties; 
  * Modeling of explicit knowledge based on specialist experience for image interpretation through fuzzy rules, fuzzy sets and a semantic net; and 
  * Processing and visualization of the results for the image interpretation.
