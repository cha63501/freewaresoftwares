**Publisher's Description**  
  


ColorCodes is a single exe file so you can put it anywhere. No other files are written to your hard drive. 

What does it do?

You are probably saying, "Not another color picker!". Well, when I was looking for one, the software I found either had too many features or not enough. I created ColorCodes to do exactly what I need and nothing more. ColorCodes looks simple but it has some great features! Of course it gives you codes for your selected color in Hexidecimal (Html), Decimal (RGB), Long, Windows Hexidecimal (red and blue are reversed) plus Hue, Saturation, Brightness (HSB) values. If you already have a color code, input it and ColorCodes converts it to the other formats and displays the color. With the RGB sliders, you train yourself visually to see what the changes do, to make selecting colors more intuitive. You can select different hues (colors), retaining the same saturation and brightness levels. This helps with finding colors that are similar. Last but not least, ColorCodes has a built in screen color picker with magnifier (zoom in up to 20x) to accurately grab the color of a single pixel anywhere on the screen! Super Handy!

How do I use it?

Everything is click and drag... You can start at the top "bar". These are "basic" colors (Hues with full saturation AND full brightness). In the second section (the largest color area), you can select a hue with full saturation OR full brightness. Adjust individual brightness and saturation levels to the far right next to the "square". Once you are satisfied with those levels, use the "third" bar to select a hue retaining your current saturation and brightness levels. Now, this last feature I use more often than I ever thought I would. Press the spacebar, the "square" turns into your display for what ever is under your mouse pointer. Use the up and down curser arrows on your keyboard to zoom in and out. Colors and codes are updated in real time. When you have found your "perfect" color, press the spacebar again to lock in that color!

ThatA's a lot of words to describe something that is actually very simple to use. You will love ColorCodes! Give it a try! ItA's only 72 KB (unzipped)! Enjoy!
