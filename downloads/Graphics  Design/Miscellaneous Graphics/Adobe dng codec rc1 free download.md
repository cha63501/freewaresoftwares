The DNG Codec was designed to provide a method for Windows Vista users to view
DNG files in the Windows Explorer and Photo Gallery.

The Arelease candidateA label applied to this technology indicates that the
codec includes all of the intended features and is well tested but will not be
released as a finished product until the community is able to help ensure that
a larger set of hardware and software configurations are used with the Codec.
