**Publisher's Description**  
  

The program aims to offer assistance in the digitizing of graphs, i.e.
recovering the tabulated X-Y dependence that the graph represents. This is the
frequently required task when the original numerical data is not available.
Common examples are scanned images taken of paper documents and screen shots
taken of electronic media. Manual as well as (semi)automatic digitizing is
possible. While only rectangular coordinate system is supported, the image can
be rotated to achieve precise alignment of axes. The recovered and properly
formatted data points can be saved to a text file or copied to clipboard.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
