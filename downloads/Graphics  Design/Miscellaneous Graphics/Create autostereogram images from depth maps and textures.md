Stereogrammer is a Windows .NET application that facilitates the creation of Autostereograms, also known as Single Image Stereograms (SIS) or, under certain conditions, Single Image Random Dot Stereograms (SIRDS). 

At its heart, Stereogrammer takes 2 images A a Depth Map and a Texture, and generates a 3rd image, which is an Autostereogram. When viewed in an appropriate manner, this image will appear to be a 3-dimensional representation of the depth map, textured with the Texture.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
