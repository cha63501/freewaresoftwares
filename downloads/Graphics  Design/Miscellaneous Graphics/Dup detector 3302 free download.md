**Publisher's Description**  
  

Dup Detector finds duplicate and near duplicate images by opening and reading
image pixel data. The program is easy to use, just specify the path and start
the scan. You can specify a match % that is required to consider the image a
duplicate and preview all found dups side by side with an option to delete
either one.

Large collections and large image file sizes can slow Dup Detector but it
works well running in the background. Large image collections often are filled
with duplicate images under different names. Use Dup Detector to clean them.
DupDetector reads 10 image file types from a folder or its subfolders or from
an image list.
