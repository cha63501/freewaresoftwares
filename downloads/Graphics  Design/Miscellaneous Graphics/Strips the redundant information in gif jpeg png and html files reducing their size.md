**Publisher's Description**  
  


Do you have a web site? Then you need StripFile. This innovative new utility strips the redundant information often contained in GIF, JPEG, PNG and HTML files, reducing their size by sometimes as much as 40 or 50%. Smaller files means faster downloading, your visitors will stick around for longer, and you could save hard cash by reducing your bandwidth requirements. 

**Features:**

  * Straightforward interface. Point the program at a file or folder. Click on "Compress". ThatA's it. 
  * Control over compression options. StripFile uses several techniques to remove data from its target files. If one doesnA't work for you, then just turn if off from the "Settings" dialog. 
  * Integrates with Explorer. If you prefer to work on the desktop, or within Explorer, then you can. Select the files or folders you need, then right-click on them and select the new "Strip" option. 
  * Creates backup files for safety. StripFile generally works very well, but if you canA't view a "stripped" file, just restore the original from the backups StripFile will automatically create. 
The program is entirely free - no ads, no registration, no hassle.
