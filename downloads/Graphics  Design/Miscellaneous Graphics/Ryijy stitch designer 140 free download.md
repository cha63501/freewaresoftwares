**Publisher's Description**  
  

Simple program for helping to design rya rug or cross stitch from an image.
Program allows cropping and resizing the image as well as reducing, replacing
colors. Image conversion uses smart color reduction algorithm to use as few
colors as possible. Minor image editing is possible and copy and paste
features can be used to edit image in external editor. Final image can be
printed with annotated grid and color map. Multiple page printing support
makes designing large works feasible. Program has own png based file format,
which makes archiving and sharing the designs with color palettes easy.

Program supports RGB colors, DMC colors and custom palette files. Colors for
custom palette can be picked from for example DMC floss so that you can
convert images directly to your own colors. New palettes can also be created
from images, so you can create palettes for other branded threads, colored
stones, or whatever.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
