**Publisher's Description**  
  

This application uses Flickr API calls to access your public photos on your
Photostream and downloads them to your desktop via a simple user interface
where you can then retrieve the HTML linkback information and the forum link
information to make it very simple to post your Flickr images around the web.

**All that is required are:**

  * The creation of a free Flickr API Key. 
  * Your Flickr username. 
  * An active internet connection. 

After installing, please download and run the 2 updates from my website at:-

v2.0 - v2.1 [Bug fixes for Vista]

v2.1 - v2.2 [GUI tweak]

Many thanks.
