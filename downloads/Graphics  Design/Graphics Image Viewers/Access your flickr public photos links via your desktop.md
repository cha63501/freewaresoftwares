**Publisher's Description**  
  


This application uses Flickr API calls to access your public photos on your Photostream and downloads them to your desktop via a simple user interface where you can then retrieve the HTML linkback information and the forum link information to make it very simple to post your Flickr images around the web. 

**All that is required are:**

  * The creation of a free Flickr API Key. 
  * Your Flickr username. 
  * An active internet connection. 

After installing, please download and run the 2 updates from my website at:-
