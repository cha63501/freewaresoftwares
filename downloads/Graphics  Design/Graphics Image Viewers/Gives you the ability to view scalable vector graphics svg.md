**Publisher's Description**  
  


Adobe SVG Viewer gives you the ability to view Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) - a language based on XML and designed for building data-driven, interactive, and optimized graphics for the Web. The Adobe SVG viewer supports most SVG elements, as well as CSS properties and DOM elements such as the SVGMatrix class and the getCTM method. It also allows you to save graphics as compressed SVG files (SVGZ format). 

Version 3.03 fixes a potential security risk on Windows computers. In addition, the ActiveX control has been signed in order to allow users to avoid the ActiveX security warning introduced with Windows XP Security Pack 2.
