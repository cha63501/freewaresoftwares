**Publisher's Description**  
  

Skyviewer is a realtime viewer for 360Adeg environments. This program was
created in order to preview rendered skies for use in 3D art and game
development, though its use can be extended to any kind of 360Adeg background
(such as QuickTime VR environments often seen in first person adventure
games).

It currently supports SPHEREMAPS (an inside-out sphere mapped with a properly
rendered 360Adeg image) and SKYBOXES (a set of six images rendered as an
inside-out cube, one image for each face).

The program automatically loads the images needed for the environment in a
single step (mapping them accordingly to the selected method). Also, it lets
you rotate the camera, zoom in and out, take screenshots, and adjust contrast
and colors of the loaded environment.

The A'contrastA' and A'contrast colorA' sliders are particularly useful if you
want to save a 2D background: these parameters allow you to alter the
resulting image a lot, and can be useful to obtain various settings while
still using the same sky.

This package also includes for FREE two skies (Big Cumulus Day, Small Cumulus
Night).
