**Publisher's Description**  
  


With CoView you can comfortably read your favorite digital comics on your computer. This tool has been designed with the comic as the most important element, removing anything else from the interface. This special design leaves a lot of room for the comic itself. There are no menus and everything is controlled with hotkeys and mouse. 

The first key you need to know is F1, to open the menu, and then i, to change language.

CoView allows you to read comics almost in any format: it supports special comic file types such as CBR and CBZ, but also images stored in archives or simply saved in folders. You can browse through them and read just like you turn the pages of a real comic. Plus, with the zoom tool you wonA't miss a single detail of the drawings, and the bookmark tool will enable you to continue your reading just where you left it.

**Coview extensions:** cbr, cbz, rar, zip, bmp, jpg, gif, png, ico, dib, wmf.
