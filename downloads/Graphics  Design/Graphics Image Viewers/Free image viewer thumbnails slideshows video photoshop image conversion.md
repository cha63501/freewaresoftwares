**Publisher's Description**  
  


The classic freeware image viewer reborn. Sleek, completely redesigned thumbnail viewer with support for slide shows, full screen viewing, video, image conversion, printing, and more. Version 5.0 adds video, multiple thumbnail layouts, powerful image enhancement tools, more formats (such as Adobe Photoshop), and a new redesigned image cache provides the ability to quickly change between thumbnail sizes so you can "zoom" in and out on your directory to find the image you are looking for. 

Besides your basic rotations and flips, a whole array of single click image enhancements are available. All can be applied to the entire image or to the area of the image you select with the selection tools, so you can zero in on the problem. For power users, an advanced enhancements tool is available with histogram controls, custom filters, and more.

Another nice new feature of version 5 is the ability to change the layout of the viewer using the thumbnail layout dropdown. 

Due to popular demand, video capability is back in One Cat Viewer. One Cat Viewer taps the power of MicrosoftA's Windows Media Player engine to display video right along with your images. Video will even play along with your slide shows! Thumbnails will show up right along with your images.

Its easy to turn off and on and is indespensible in searching through large image collections quickly, getting a solid idea of what is in each directory without having to scroll through them. This is one addictive feature you will not know how you did without!
