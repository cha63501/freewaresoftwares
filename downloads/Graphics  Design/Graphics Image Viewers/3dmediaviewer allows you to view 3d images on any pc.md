**Publisher's Description**  
  


3DMediaViewer is a free software tool that allows you to view 3D images on any PC. It can be used to view 3D images in either JPS (JPEG Stereo) or MPO (Multi-Picture Object) format, and it supports three display modes: 

  1. _3D Vision_ \- You can view 3D images in stunning quality on a PC equipped with the NVIDIA 3D VisionA system. 
  2. _Interlaced_ \- You can also view 3D images with excellent results on a PC connected to a 3D monitor that displays 3D by interlacing two images. Viewing in this mode requires polarized glasses similar to those used in 3D movie theaters. For example, Hyundai offers a class of 3D monitors that work this way. 
  3. _Anaglyph_ \- You can still view 3D images even without a 3D-capable monitor, using anaglyph mode. Viewing in this mode requires red/cyan (or red/blue) filtered glasses. Search the web for "anaglyph glasses" to find dealers, such as 3dglassesdirect.com and berezin.com. This is a very inexpensive way to discover the world of 3D, but the image quality is not nearly as good as in the other display modes. 

3DMedia also offers 3DComposer, a powerful software tool that allows you to create captivating 3D photos using your existing digital camera.
