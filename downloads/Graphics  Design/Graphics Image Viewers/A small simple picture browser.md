**Publisher's Description**  
  


Yapp provides you with a convenient way to view and organize your photos. An image can be viewed full-screen simply by pressing the spacebar. Slide shows, batch renaming, and lossless JPEG rotation are only a mouse click or a keystroke away. You can create new folders, drag and drop files, and quickly move, copy, rename, or delete them. No decisions are made for you: where you put your pictures and what you call them is entirely up to you, so you can organize your photos in a way that makes sense to you. Yapp just makes it easier. 

Yapp is lightweight and highly scalable, so it can browse through folders containing thousands of images without slowing down appreciably. An extensive set of well-documented keyboard shortcuts helps those with fast fingers and a need for speed get things done rapidly. Yapp supports jpeg, gif, and bmp formats.
