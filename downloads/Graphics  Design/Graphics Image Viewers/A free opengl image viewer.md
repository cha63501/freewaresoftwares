**Publisher's Description**  
  


ModernView is a freeware OpenGL image viewer that displays images without flickering, flashing, tearing, jittering, jumping or waiting. 

With ModernView watching or presenting images looks professional and is fun too thanks to a modern graphics card and a simple, consistent and efficient user interface. 

ModernView zooms and scrolls large images extremely softly and smoothly without delay or compromising image quality (e.g. by reducing resolution or skipping necessary on-the-fly image filtering). It opens all common Windows image formats, offers a full screen mode with full functionality and supports also dual monitors. 2D Scrollbar panning, selection zooming and a magnifier are nice-to-have features as well.

Just make sure you have installed the latest graphics drivers supporting OpenGL 1.5 (all modern ones do). 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
