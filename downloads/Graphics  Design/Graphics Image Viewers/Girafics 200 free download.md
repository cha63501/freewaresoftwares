**Publisher's Description**  
  

Girafics is a program designed as a quick and easy graphic option integrated
into the right click menu of Windows Explorer, though it need not be
registered to run as a stand-alone program.

Girafics is similar in operation to the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer except
having more options! If registered, Girafics will be available whenever a file
list is shown, for example when selecting a file to attach to an email. You
can therefore easily resize a graphic or perhaps change it to a JPEG and save
it so that your emailed graphic is a smaller size. All functions and options
are available from a popup menu.
