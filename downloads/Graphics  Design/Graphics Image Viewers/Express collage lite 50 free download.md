**Publisher's Description**  
  

eXPress Collage Lite enables you to make more than a simple photo slideshow.
With Collage, your photos become a work of art with custom-designed
backgrounds and frames, coordinated captions and the ability to display
multiple images per canvas using a variety of page layout designs. Collage
Lite projects can be saved as self-extracting executables, so the files can be
shared with others who do not have Collage installed. The eXPress Collage Lite
download includes over two dozen pre-designed templates, Help Topics, tutorial
and demo.
