bcTester reads barcodes from images or PDF files. Linear barcodes can be
recognized as well as modern 2D-(two dimensional) barcodes Find out what is
encoded in the barcodes you see! Just create an image file by scanning or
taking a picture of the barcode, and bcTester reads it from the file.

For recognition, bcTester uses the QS-Barcode library of the QS-Barcode SDK
(software development kit) made by QualitySoft, Hamburg. Barcode on pages of
Adobe PDF documents can be read as well.
