**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pixels is a fast graphics viewer with advanced image processing. This software
is specifically designed to handle a large number of files distributed over
multiple folders with ease. It allows you to browse through a huge file tree
and allows you to perform simple file actions such as rename, delete, move and
copy right from the thumbnail view. It also introduces a unique grouping
function that allows you to manage the files without necessarily moving them
from their physical location. This feature can be very useful if you are
trying to sort pictures downloaded from your digital camera or from your
favourite download site. Pixels also includes a slide show mode. The software
does not stop there however. It also includes advanced image processing
filters such as sharpen, blur, edge detection and more.
