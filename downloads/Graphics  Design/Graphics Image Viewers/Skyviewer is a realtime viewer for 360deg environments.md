**Publisher's Description**  
  


Skyviewer is a realtime viewer for 360Adeg environments. This program was created in order to preview rendered skies for use in 3D art and game development, though its use can be extended to any kind of 360Adeg background (such as QuickTime VR environments often seen in first person adventure games). 

It currently supports SPHEREMAPS (an inside-out sphere mapped with a properly rendered 360Adeg image) and SKYBOXES (a set of six images rendered as an inside-out cube, one image for each face).

The program automatically loads the images needed for the environment in a single step (mapping them accordingly to the selected method). Also, it lets you rotate the camera, zoom in and out, take screenshots, and adjust contrast and colors of the loaded environment.

The A'contrastA' and A'contrast colorA' sliders are particularly useful if you want to save a 2D background: these parameters allow you to alter the resulting image a lot, and can be useful to obtain various settings while still using the same sky.

This package also includes for FREE two skies (Big Cumulus Day, Small Cumulus Night).
