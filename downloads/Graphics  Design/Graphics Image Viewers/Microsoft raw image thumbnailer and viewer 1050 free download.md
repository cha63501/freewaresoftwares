The Microsoft RAW Image Thumbnailer and Viewer is a free PowerToy for
Microsoft Windows XP that provides the ability to view, organize, and print
photos captured in RAW image formats from supported digital cameras.

  * Familiar user experience. This software builds on the familiar Windows user experience and requires little or no learning curve. 
  * Performance tuned for rapid previews. The software uses background processing and other techniques to ensure a good preview experience even for large images.
