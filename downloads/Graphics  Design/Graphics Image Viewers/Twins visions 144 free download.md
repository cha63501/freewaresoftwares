**Publisher's Description**  
  

Visions is an innovative 3D image management system (3DIMS) which allows you
to navigate through your photos in a 3D (three dimensional) world. This way
you can view your folders as a collection of boards spread on your screen,
allowing you to easily perform cross folder actions such as moving photos from
one folder to another, comparing two folders or simply viewing photos from
several folders at the same time.

Visions is designed in a way that enables you to do all common tasks in one
single point: view, edit and share. Therefore, you donA't need different
applications for each task, instead- use Visions to complete all these tasks
in one place!

Editing your photos is now simpler than ever. Using its powerful editor,
Visions enables you to fix, adjust and apply impressive effects with just a
few clicks. Its advanced Meta (EXIF) editor allows you to modify tags recorded
by your digital camera or create your own tags.

Visions also allows you to share photos with everyone more easily. Use your
own existing FlickrA account to edit photo details, upload new photos or
download photos directly to your computer. You can also view photos from other
FlickrA users, make comments or download their photos to your computer.
