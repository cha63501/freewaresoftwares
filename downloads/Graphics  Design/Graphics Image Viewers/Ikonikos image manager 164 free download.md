**Publisher's Description**  
  

Ikonikos is an image manager that works with tags instead of using
directories. With them, you can create powerful search filters. ItA's also
very portable, easy to use, and fast.

**WhatA's New in version 1.6.4:**

I noticed the stable branch had some serious bugs introduced when I made the
program internally simpler. This release fixes the following bugs:

  * Fixes the language chooser window, that was not being shown by default if this program was not started by the first time. 
  * Fixes a bug where message strings were not being properly translated. 
This release also fixes a bug introduced in version 1.6 of Ikonikos, where a
bug in the filter window prevented the filter to work with labels.
