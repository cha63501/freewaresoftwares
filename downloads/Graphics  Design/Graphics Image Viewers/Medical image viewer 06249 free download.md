**Publisher's Description**  
  

MIview is an OpenGL based medical image viewer that contains useful tools such
as a DICOM anonymizer and format conversion utility. MIView can read DICOM,
Analyze/Nifti, and raster images, and can write Analyze/Nifti and raster
images. It can also read and convert DICOM mosaic images.

The main goal of MIView is to provide a platform to load any type of medical
image and be able to view and manipulate the image. Volume rendering is the
main type of advanced visualization that MIview is trying to implement.

With modern graphics cards supporting multiple shader elements, such as the
ATIA's X850 supporting 12 parallel shading units and NVidiaA's 8800GT
supporting 112 shading units, the ability of current hardware to render
computationally intensive scenes is becoming common enough for most users to
be able to view volume rendered images in real time.

**Requirements:** For visualization, you must have at least a 1.5GHz processor, 1GB RAM, and a video card that supports at least OpenGL 1.5.

**WhatA's New:**

  * [add] Conversion utility 
  * [add] License in the installer 
  * [add] Improved volume rendering 
  * [fix] Color mapping works on NVidia 8800GT 
  * [fix] improved FPS counting and fixed in volume rendering view
