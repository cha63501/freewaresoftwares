**Publisher's Description**  
  


Girafics is a program designed as a quick and easy graphic option integrated into the right click menu of Windows Explorer, though it need not be registered to run as a stand-alone program. 

Girafics is similar in operation to the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer except having more options! If registered, Girafics will be available whenever a file list is shown, for example when selecting a file to attach to an email. You can therefore easily resize a graphic or perhaps change it to a JPEG and save it so that your emailed graphic is a smaller size. All functions and options are available from a popup menu.
