**Publisher's Description**  
  

Image viewer (windows size = image size). With the contextual menu, or by
double-click if ImageOpen is your image viewer by default, you can open an
image (jpg, png, bmp, ico, tif ...), and you can start a slideshow in the
selected folder.

Click on image to view next image (or "Next" - Alt+Right arrow). Select
"Previous" (Alt+Left arrow) to view previous image. The "Slideshow" command
allows you to start a diaporama; the "Faster" and "Slower" commands sets the
duration of the timer.

Select "Top" so that ImageOpen always stays on top of the others windows. For
the very large images, you can select "Open with IE" to view the image in
Internet Explorer. The "No Border" command allows you to hide windowA's border
(e.g. to view icons in real size).

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
