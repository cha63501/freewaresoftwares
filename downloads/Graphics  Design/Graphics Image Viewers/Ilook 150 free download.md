**Publisher's Description**  
  

i.Look magnifies the area of pixels under the mouse so you can easily see fine
detail or examine things closely. But it also does a number of other useful
things that I ended up tacking on to this application instead of having lots
of separate downloads.

**Features:**

  * GB under cursor in hex and decimal. 
  * Current mouse position and offset from recent position. 
  * Centered on the current mouse position. 
  * Configurable zoom from 2x to 16x. 
  * Optional grid lines. 
  * Optional always on top. 
  * Option to update every second.
