**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pixopedia is an intuitive media editor with a new drawing engine that gives
users a new way to work on their projects. The user interface makes it easy to
find the tools needed to draw and edit files, which include videos.

All brushes have their own settings, texture, color and background. You can
create brush parameters, actions and tools as sticky forms, which you can
detach and move freely. This functionality makes the program ideal for
extended desktop environments using two monitors. The forms become invisible
when you are drawing and re-appear after you complete your drawing.

To start drawing using the current brush, click, hold and move the left mouse
button. Release the button, press number 2 and repeat the steps to draw
another stroke using a different brush. You change brushes by pressing between
numbers 1 and 9. You can change brushes on the fly by pressing their
respective numbers while you are drawing. You can also modify all the brushes
at once or individually.

Pressing the right mouse button brings up a pop-up menu that allows you to
select standard shapes. You can work in two modes:

  * Standard mode displays buttons and tools panels 
  * Menu mode displays only the menu button and is recommended for advanced users 

**Requirements**

  * Windows XP or above 
  * At least 1280 x 1024 screen resolution 
  * Pentium IV CPU or better 
  * At least 1 GB RAM
