**Publisher's Description**  
  


Bit_funk is a graphics editor similar to MSPaint. 

**Overview:** Bit_funk is not a completed program yet, but what is there works. It is advised that you do not try to print with it though; it is able to, but it usually comes out skewed. I am still working on that. Overall it has some nice features, such as the ability to create backgrounds, special effects, and has a variety of tools.

**Formats:** Can open just about any format. Can save as *.bmp, *.gif, or *.png.

**Features:** Several pallettes, a bunch of tools, background generation, special effects, and user-friendly interface.
