**Publisher's Description**  
  


Paint.NET is free image and photo editing software for computers that run Windows. It features an intuitive and innovative user interface with support for layers, unlimited undo, special effects, and a wide variety of useful and powerful tools. An active and growing online community provides friendly help, tutorials, and plugins. 

It started development as an undergraduate college senior design project mentored by Microsoft , and is currently being maintained by some of the alumni that originally worked on it. Originally intended as a free replacement for the Microsoft Paint software that comes with Windows, it has grown into a powerful yet simple image and photo editor tool. It has been compared to other digital photo editing software packages such as AdobeA(r) PhotoshopA(r), CorelA(r) Paint Shop ProA(r), Microsoft Photo Editor, and The GIMP.

The programming language used to create Paint.NET is C#, with GDI+ extensions. 

Paint.NET has many of the powerful features that expensive commercial applications have, including the ability to use layers.
