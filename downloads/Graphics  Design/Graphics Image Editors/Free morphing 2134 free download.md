**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free Morphing creates a sequence of frames which are the transformation of the
source image to target image, giving the appearance that the source image
"becomes" the target. Images must be true color (24 bit) and have the same
size. In the program you can create lines (the same number in Source and
Target) which describe the transformation. You should create line objects in
the same order on boths images. There are various viewing tools for preview
morphing.

**Features:**

  * You can specify the number of frames in sequence. 
  * You can create symmetric sequence. 
  * You can save resulting movies as animated GIF, AVI and so on.
