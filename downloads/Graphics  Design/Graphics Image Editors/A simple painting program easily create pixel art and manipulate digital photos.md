**Publisher's Description**  
  


mtPaint is a simple painting program which I developed from scratch so I could easily create pixel art and manipulate digital photos. 

It uses the GTK+ toolkit (version 1 or 2) and runs on PCA's via the GNU/Linux or Windows operating systems. Because of its simplicity it can also run on older PC hardware (e.g. a 200MHz CPU and 32MB of RAM).

By default it is in the English language, but there are also translations available for other languages such as Spanish, Czech, French, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.

mtPaint is free software, which means you are able to freely use, modify and distribute it according to the GNU General Public License.
