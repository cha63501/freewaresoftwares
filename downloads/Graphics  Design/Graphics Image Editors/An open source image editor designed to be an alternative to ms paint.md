  * Image options for resize, scale, rotating, flipping and more... 
  * Filters for invert, blur, pixelize, grayscale, monotone and more... 

**What's New in version 1.2 Beta:**

  * View menu now has options to show/hide the windows and bars. 
  * Added manifest file to installer to fix side-by-side dll error
