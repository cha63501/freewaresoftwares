**Publisher's Description**  
  

A fun photo editor for colour-select effects. Tint automatically clusters the
colours of a photo into groups, allowing each to be switched on or off to
create the desired effect. Its greatest strength lies in its intelligence and
ease of use, producing striking results in minutes where manual manipulation
takes much longer.

The download for linux is [available
