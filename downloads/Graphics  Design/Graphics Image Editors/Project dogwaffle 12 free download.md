**Publisher's Description**  
  

Project Dogwaffle is paint software for the PC with built-in, user-defined,
animated & fractal particle brushes. A companion to your 2D+3D web authoring
or animation tools, or as your first step into virtual art and matte painting
with mouse or tablet, it is here for you to paint, sketch, animate and
paint... almost like on the real thing, but without the mess or occasional
spill! Draw Anime, enjoy nature painting, edit photos & digital images, add
special FX to CG animations, do professional post work, and create fantasy
art. For developers and VB programmers thereA's also a free SDK to extend
Dogwaffle with more filters and plugins.

Dogwaffle version 1.2 is a new product based on the powerful achitecture of
Dogwaffle 2.0. WeA've created a light, yet powerful tool for artistic
expression. We felt that the aging free version (1.11b) was in need of an
update, since it was written for earlier operating systems and we wanted our
new users to have the speed and power of our newer software architecture.

Dogwaffle 1.2 is not just a stripped-down demo of our software - itA's a fully
functional version with some new features too. It is not save-disabled,
thereA's no time-limit, no registration needed.

For users who want to get the full power of Project Dogwaffe, we offer the
commercial version at a low price. In it, you will get even more power with
advanced features, more filters, more special FX and more animation support.

We feel that version 1.2 is a great free tool for artists who are just getting
started, and for seasoned professionals alike.

Thanks for painting, and thanks for waffling!
