**Publisher's Description**  
  

CinePaint is an open source painting program built for image processing and
deep paint manipulation.

CinePaint is used for motion picture frame-by-frame retouching, dirt removal,
wire rig removal, render repair, background plates, and 3d model textures.
ItA's been used on many feature films, including The Last Samurai where it was
used to add flying arrows. ItA's also being used by pro photographers who need
greater color fidelity than is available in other tools.

CinePaint is fundamentally different from other painting tools because it
handles high fidelity image formats such as Kodak Cineon, SMPTE DPX, and ILM-
NVIDIA OpenEXR. To do that properly requires a 32-bit per channel color engine
core so that data isnA't crushed into 8-bit color channels.

The CinePaint core is 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit as needed. ItA's different
from GraphicsMagick which also supports different color depths but only as a
compile-time switch. (GraphicsMagick has better support for film industry file
formats than ImageMagick.)
