NVIDIAA(r) GelatoA(r) rendering software brings high-quality rendering to the
masses. A hardware-accelerated, non-real-time renderer, Gelato allows you to

the creation of 3D visual effects and animation in feature films, Gelato can
be used by anyone with NVIDIA hardware to create images of the very highest
quality.

**ItA's Fast**  
Gelato is a software program that leverages the NVIDIA GPU as a floating point
math processor. This allows Gelato to render images faster than comparable
renderers, but without the quality limitations traditionally associated with
real-time graphics processing on the GPU.

and small studios can take advantage of a high-end renderer with the
capabilities of renderers costing thousands of dollars.

**ItAs Full Featured**  
If you require extra power in your 3D rendering pipeline, you can upgrade to
Gelato Pro. With Gelato Pro you get the features required for production
rendering:

  * NVIDIAA(r) SorbettoA interactive relighting technology 
  * DSO shadeops 
  * Network parallel rendering 
  * Multithreading 
  * Native 64-bit support 
  * Maintenance and support from NVIDIAAs High-Quality-Rendering Team
