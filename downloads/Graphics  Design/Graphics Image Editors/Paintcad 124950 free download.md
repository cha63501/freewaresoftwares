Producing animated GIFs is not as complicated as you may think-at least when
you use the right program. If you want to design stunning images and even
videos without purchasing expensive programs, then PaintCAD is the ideal
software for you. This freeware drawing program from Blackstrip Studios makes
it easy to create 3D images and different GIF animations.

PaintCAD is used for drawing animated images. Although the program was started
as a JAVA midlet for mobile phones, its creators re-wrote its code for Windows
operating system. It allows you to create attractive images from scratch even
if you are a novice. Creating animated GIFs is as easy as creating and
assembling GIF animation frames. Drawings can be created using the keyboard,
mouse or touchscreen. This makes it a handy tool because drawing a new picture
using the mouse alone is challenging. Have you every struggled with lines that
did not want to curve at the right places?

**New Features**

The latest version of PaintCAD has several new features, including:

  * New command in the Alpha menu called "Create mask in clipboard," which allows users to select transparent colors for creating alpha-masks of current pictures and placing them on the clipboard 
  * The ability to convert colors to their grey equivalents using a new button in the RGB tab 
  * Another new tab in the same place allows for copying of other colors to the current 
  * A new submenu under the "Muzz Music Generator" that gives the ability to manipulate melodies in a variety of ways 

**Using PaintCAD**

combinations did. For example, we learned that pressing cntrl +

When you start a new project, you have the option of choosing width, height
and colors. Alternatively, you can copy and paste or load an existing picture
to work on. You can even take pictures or videos using a webcam. The program
also allows you to extract JPG or BMP frames from AVI video or pack the frames
to create AVI video.

If you have difficulties, the comprehensive Help menu will show you the ropes.
The program is more than drawing software. For example, among the extras is a
mini browser that can access both the contents of a computer and the Web.

**Pros**

  * No need of installation 
  * Ability to use keyboard alone for drawing 
  * A large selection of tools and effects 

**Cons**

  * Can be a little challenging for first-time users 

PaintCAD is available for computers, notebooks and tablets. It currently
supports GIF, JPG, BMP and ICO image file formats.
