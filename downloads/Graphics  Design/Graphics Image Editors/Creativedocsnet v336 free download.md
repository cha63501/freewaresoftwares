**Publisher's Description**  
  

Creative Docs .NET is a vector-based graphic design tool with support for rich
text, ideal to quickly write short documents, manuals, posters, illustrations,
schemas, plans, flow charts, and much more.

The interface is tailored for high productivity: it does never get in your
way. Creative Docs .NET tools are simple, yet powerful. All styles and
attributes can be modified interactively with a minimum number of mouse
clicks. A color gradient, for instance, can be modified directly by dragging
its handles in the document window.

Note: This software is being actively developed.

Creative Docs .NET 3.x is available for free as a full-featured version. It
comes with no warranty whatsoever.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
