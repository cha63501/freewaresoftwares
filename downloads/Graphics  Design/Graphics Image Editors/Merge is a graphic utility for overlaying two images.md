Merge is a very simple graphic utility for overlaying two images or text in any relative position prior to saving to a file. You can merge the two images in different ways as well as smooth blending in of just part of an image to the final result. 

There is a batch merge feature which is useful to watermark all of your favorite pictures. Merge also allows text entry of any size, font and color to be merged with an image.
