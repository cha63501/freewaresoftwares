**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ambereh is a simple and easy-to-use drawing application with online and offline capabilities. 

In online mode, you can chat and share the same canvas with your friends, allowing you to make a cooperative painting. There is no need for a central server: Ambereh works with a decentralized network, where any user can connect to any other user already in the party, and everybody will see and interact with everybodyA's drawings.

In solo mode, you have a great set of tools for artistic drawing, like anti-aliased brushes, brushes with custom bitmaps, full opacity support, circles drawing, auto-circles for softneing edges, blur and smudge for giving the detailed touches for your sketch!

In both cases, you also get the ability to record all the steps taken in your drawing, so later you can replay the whole process and watch your painting coming to life: from the blank canvas to the final masterpiece!

  * Anti-aliased brush
