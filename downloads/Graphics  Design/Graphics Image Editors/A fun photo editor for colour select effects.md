**Publisher's Description**  
  


A fun photo editor for colour-select effects. Tint automatically clusters the colours of a photo into groups, allowing each to be switched on or off to create the desired effect. Its greatest strength lies in its intelligence and ease of use, producing striking results in minutes where manual manipulation takes much longer.
