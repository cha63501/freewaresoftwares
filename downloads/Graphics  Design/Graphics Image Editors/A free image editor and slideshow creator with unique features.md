PhotoSun is a powerful and free image editor that allows users to apply many effects to enhance their pictures. The program is compatible with different image formats, including GIF, JPG, JPEG, BMP, PNG, EMF, EXIF, TIFF and ICO. 

**PhotoSun Features**

  * Powerful photo enhance capabilities 
  * Supports drag and drop 
  * Editing metadata for improved photo organization 
  * Different print options 
  * Ability to share photos by either Facebook or e-mail 
  * Multilanguage 

**Using PhotoSun**

Although the installer is relatively large, being almost 44 MB, we took just about a minute to install it. The installed program was 45.68 MB.

The programAs interface is divided into three main areas: the buttons for photo manipulation are at the top, a thumbnail of the selected image and its details appear on the left section while the working environment covers the remaining part. The straightforward layout makes it easy to use the program. We could drag pictures and drop them into the working area or select them using the browse function. We could also load all images in a directory.

PhotoSunAs AResizeA and ARotateA features function slightly differently compared to other image editors. We had to enter the number of pixels, as it had no option to resize by percentage, which some users may find convenient. The ARotateA feature automatically turns images clockwise by 45 degrees. However, it includes a AStraightenA feature that many programs do not have, which you can use to adjust angles slightly.

Another feature that many photo editors do not have is the ability to play interactive slideshows. PhotoSun allowed us to create full-screen slideshows, complete with our defined transition delays, themes and songs. However, whenever we tried to add other songs in our computer apart from the bundled ones, we kept receiving an error message.

Other things we could do with the free image editor included adding special effects like boosting color, improving image quality using sharpening and denoising effects in addition to the usual ones like contrast and brightness, uploading pictures on Facebook and sending them via e-mail.

The program also allowed us to edit metadata about photos and cameras used to take them, including GPS information if available. However, we could only get metadata for JPG and JPEG image formats.

**Pros**

  * Gives many photo enhancing options 
  * Provides useful details like when pictures were taken and the types of cameras used 
  * Easy to use 

**Cons**

    * Although the program is free, it opened a donation page every time we launched it
