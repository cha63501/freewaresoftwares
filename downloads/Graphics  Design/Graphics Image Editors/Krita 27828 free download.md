**Publisher's Description**  
  

Krita is a KDE program for sketching and painting, offering an endAtoAend
solution for creating digital painting files from scratch by masters. Fields
of painting that Krita explicitly supports are concept art, creation of comics
and textures for rendering. Modelled on existing real-world painting materials
and workflows, Krita supports creative working by getting out of the way and
with a snappy response.

Note that when we say "Krita is a KDE program", that doesnA't mean you need to
run the Plasma Desktop to run Krita. It means that Krita as a project is proud
to be part of the wonderful KDE community and uses the great framework
technology that the KDE community develops. You can run Krita on Windows,
Gnome, XFCE, and if you spend some effort even on OSX.

There are three versions of Krita: Krita Sketch, for touch devices, Krita
Desktop desktop systems and finally Krita Studio, which is like Krita Desktop
but supported by KO GmbH. You can find info and the download links for the
other Krita programs as well as various Linux ditros on the [developerA's
download page](http://krita.org/download).

A 64-Bit version is also available: [Download Krita
