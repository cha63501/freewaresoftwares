**Publisher's Description**  
  

MeshLab is an open source portable and extensible system for the processing
and editing of unstructured 3D triangular meshes. The system relies for mesh
processing tasks on the gpl VCG library (vcg.sf.net).

The system is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small
unstructured models arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools for
editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting this kind of
meshes.

**Features:**

  * Interactive selection and deletion of portion of the mesh. Even for large models. 
  * Painting interface for selecting, smoothing and coloring meshes. 
  * Input/output in many formats: 
    * import:PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS, COLLADA, PTX 
    * export:PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS, COLLADA, VRML, DXF 
  * Mesh Cleaning Filters: 
    * removal of duplicated, unreferenced vertices, null faces 
    * removal of small isolated components 
    * coherent normal unification and flipping 
    * erasing of non manifold faces 
    * automatic filling of holes 
  * Remeshing filters: 
    * High quality edge collapse simplfication (even meshes with texture coords preservation) 
    * Surface reconstruction from points (a ball pivoting variant) 
    * Subdivision surfaces (loop and butterfly) 
    * Feature preserving smoothing and fairing filters 
  * Various Colorization/Inspection filters 
    * Gaussian and mean curvature 
    * Border edges 
    * Non two-manifold edges 
    * Self intersecting faces 
  * Interactive Mesh Painting 
    * Color Painting 
    * Selection paint 
    * Smoothing 
  * OpenGL Shader based rendering (write your own shader!) compatible with Typhoon LabA's Shader Designer 
  * Large rendering (up to 16k x 16k) for high quality printing 
  * The history of the all performed cleaning/editing actions can be re-played on different meshes or saved and for archival purposes. 
  * Extendible plugins based architecture, writing new mesh processing functions, colorization filters and support for different file formats is quite easy!
