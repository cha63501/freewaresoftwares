**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you want to enhance the appearance of your pictures, then you need to edit
them in stereo format, which is where StereoPhoto Maker comes in. The handy
application provides several functions that make it easy for users to improve
the features of their photos.

You will access most of the features in a process that takes only two steps.
If you are not impressed with the user interface, then remember that it is
primarily designed for functionality. You can align many images simultaneously
with the help of the SIFT algorithm that allows for extracting of numerous
features from different images.

You can project images onto a sphere and then use a clone brush to adjust
incorrectly applied features and create the right stereo depth. Built-in
mirror positions, coupled with the stereo imaging mode, help users to track
the changes they make.

StereoPhoto Maker also allows both experienced HTML users and those with
hardly any relevant skills to create Web pages. Inexperienced users can upload
the contents of their applet-projects to a server and then use
StereoPhotoViewer applet to develop Web pages. Seasoned HTML coders can use it
to personalize their webpage projects. For example, the application will help
them create complex anaglyphs for their HTML projects.

StereoPhoto Maker is a versatile application that can serve both professional
users and those interested in creating personal stereo 3D images equally well.
