**Publisher's Description**  
  

Utility to add custom watermarking to images. Using this tool you can import
your own image and view it in the preview pane - then using the toolbar
options, you can change the settings for font, size, location and colour until
you are happy with your selection, then you can preview the custom watermark
that you have created and save it to a selected location on your computer.

This can then be used as a copyrighted image to you so that no one else can
steal your images! You may find this utility particularly useful if you are an
online seller or a blogger and want to protect your images.
