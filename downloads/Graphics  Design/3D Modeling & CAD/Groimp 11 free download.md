**Publisher's Description**  
  

GroIMP (Growth Grammar-related Interactive Modeling Platform) is a 3D-modeling
platform. As such, GroIMP contains features known from modeling software:

  * Interactive editing of scenes 
  * Rich set of 3D objects, including primitives, NURBS curves and surfaces, height fields 
  * Material options like colours, textures 
  * Real-time rendering using OpenGL 
  * Export to POV-Ray, a free ray-tracer 
  * Export to DXF, partial export to VRML/X3D 
  * The built-in raytracer Twilight renders the scene 
  * A light-model based on the built-in raytracer computes the distribution of light within a scene 
GroIMP distinguishes itself from other modeling software by the modeling
potential of growth grammars. This potential is made accessible by the
integration of the modeling language XL.

The GroIMP distributions provide a tutorial and examples for the usage of the
modelling language XL within GroIMP. The turotial and the examples are
integrated as plugins, they are available via the menu items File/RGG Tutorial
and File/Show Examples.
