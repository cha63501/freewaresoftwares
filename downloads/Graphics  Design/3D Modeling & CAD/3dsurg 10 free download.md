**Publisher's Description**  
  

3DSurG is used to create 3D surfaces based on either 3D implicit functions (
f(x,y,z)=0 ) or parametric functions ( x=f(u,v), y=f(u,v), z=f(u,v) ).

The generated 3D surface can be easily scaled and exported to AutoCAD (*.DXF)
and text file, or saved as various graphics data format such as Bitmap, JPG,
and PNG.

3DSurG also provides rotation, pan, and zoom in/out to view generated model.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
