**Publisher's Description**  
  

FidoCadJ is a very easy to use editor, with a library of electrical symbols
and footprints (through hole and SMD). Drawings can be exported in several of
graphic formats (PDF, EPS, PGF for LaTeX, SVG, PNG, JPG). Even if it is very
simple, it can be still considered an Electronic design automation (EDA)
software.

FidoCadJ is inspired from FidoCad (without "J"), which was a vector graphic
editor useful for electrical schematics and printed circuit boards. It uses a
file format containing only 7-bit ASCII text, very compact and suited for copy
and pasting from/into newsgroups and forum messages. This determined its
success among the italian Usenet community, from late A'90s.

Unfortunately, FidoCad was able to run only on Microsoft Windows. This is the
reason why I decided to write FidoCadJ, a small editor compatible with
FidoCad, but multi-platform running on MacOSX, Linux and Windows. FidoCadJ is
internationalized and its interface and manuals are available in english,
french and italian.

  * Export in a variety of graphic formats 
  * Multi platform 
  * Easy to use 
  * Compact text format, for copy/pasting in Usenet messages
