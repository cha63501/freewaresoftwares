**Publisher's Description**  
  


aeliom (el-yom) is a real-time virtual scenery generation, rendering, and exploration software. It is the fruit of 2 yearsA' research on landscape and architecture rendering. Thanks to its innovative engine, aeliom is the place where true per-pixel rendering quality meets 3D real time exploration ! 

aeliom is not only a viewer. It is also a compiler, and allows user, via its language, to generate complete worlds. Finally, aeliom is a stand-alone renderer, that generates superb materials for each pixel.

Its graphic user interface supports 4 languages (German [new], English, French and Spanish), and totally benefits from OpenGL (allowing rich multimedia environments). 

**Features:**

  * Aeliom is free for non profit use, 
  * compiler for the aeliom language (include a shader language), 
  * stand-alone high precision renderer, 
  * complex surfaces (high order, and Boolean ops),

  * complex sky lighting, 
  * complex real time atmospheric volumetric effect (rays of light, fog, A), 
  * LOD for both the geometry and the materials, 
  * natural elements : water planes with ripples, volumetric clouds (with shadow projection), planar clouds, ... 
  * displacement mapping, 
  * view frustum culling (octree management), geometry coherency, portals, ...
