**Publisher's Description**  
  

3D Message is an easy-to-use, parametric CAD tool for everyday communications.
It is an ideal helper for anyone who likes to illustrate an idea or an
explanation easily and quickly by 3D drawing.

The user interface is very friendly and intuitive. In a few minutes, you can
compose a scene, populate it with objects, change object dimensions, location,
orientation, colors, and reflectivities. You can also apply textures to
objectsA' surfaces. After all these transformations, you can save the scene in
a file.

The scene files are amazingly small (only a few kilobytes). You can send them
by email. Your recipients do not need to buy any product to read your 3D
messages -- they can use the Trial version as a free viewer to view your
scenes.

3D Message is a stand-alone tool. It does not depend on any other applications
or any third-party packages.

**Requires:** 64 MB Graphics card
