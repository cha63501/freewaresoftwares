Free coordinate geometry (COGO) tool for field surveyors and map drafters.

**Features:**

  * Calculate surveys and manage points, effortlessly 
  * Run Copan on Windows 2K/XP/Vista/7 
  * Use it forever and pay nothing 
  * Choose quadrant bearings or N/S azimuths, and gons or DMS 
  * Create point files quickly and easily 
  * Edit any pointA's number, name, coords, code or note 
  * Specifiy groups of points for listing or processing 
  * Edit points: renumber, delete, lock, convert to 2D 
  * Transform coordinates: 
    * Specify rotation, scale and shift parameters of transformation 
    * Compute best-fit transformation between sets of points 
  * Import/export points from/to character-separated value or fixed format ascii files 
  * Export points to Geodimeter or Leica total station files 
  * COGO using points, bearings, and distances and offsets: 
    * Direct and inverse 
    * Corner angle 
    * Bearing-bearing intersection 
    * Distance-distance intersection 
    * Bearing-distance intersection 
  * Express bearings and distances via point numbers 
  * Calculate multiple inverses from one to many points: 
    * Angles and distances 
    * Bearings and distances 
    * Chainage and offsets 
  * Process field survey data: 
    * Calc and adjust traverses and radials, via HAs, VAs and SDs 
    * Calc and adjust traverses and radials, via bearings, VAs and SDs 
    * Calc freestations via HAs, VAs and SDs 
    * Manually edit data 
    * Import from Geodimeter JOB, TDS RAW, Nikon RAW, Leica GSI, Wild GRE 
    * Export to GeoLab IOB 
  * Process map data, even those describing curves: 
    * Calc and adjust traverses, areas and perimeters, via points, bearings and distances 
    * Check traverses, areas and perimeters, via bearings and distances 
    * Calc traverses, areas and perimeters, via points 
    * Export to ESRI Traverse format 
  * Apply azimuth correction, scale factor or units factor to any calc
