**Publisher's Description**  
  


Misfit Model 3D is an OpenGL-based 3D model editor that works with triangle-based models. It supports multi-level undo, skeletal animations, simple texturing, scripting, command-line batch processing, and a plugin system for adding new model and image filters. 

Complete online help is included. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend with plugins and scripts.

**What's New in version 1.3.8 Beta:**

  * Don't report power of two warning for background images 
  * Allow undo for texture coordinate vertex selection 
  * Rotate texture coordinates 
  * Horizontal/vertical flip texture coordinates 
  * Allow user to set color of texture coordinate lines and selection vertices. 
  * Include hidden triangles in BSP tree calculation, but don't render hidden triangles 
  * Change Hide Unselected so that it operates on the face level rather than face and vertex 
  * Add group clean-up window that removes identical/unused groups and materials 
  * Show dimensions of selected geometry in context panel 
  * Added grid unit distance to status bar 
  * In MD3, use anim name + frame num for frame name on export 
  * Use QString::toDouble instead of atof for localization reasons 
  * Fix incorrect group/texture mapping for copy/paste 
  * Fix viewport drawing mode so that it is applied to loaded models 
  * Fix texture rendering after deleted textures (off by one on greater index) 
  * Fix to draw proper normals for ungrouped geometry in skeletal animations 
  * Fix to prevent selection of hidden faces when using the "ignore back-facing" option 
  * Fix broken shortcuts on geometry sub-menus 
  * Fix coverage build/autoconf 
  * Fix MD2 export (vertex/texture coord indices) 
  * Fix relative path to parent dir for textures in OBJ format 
  * Fix cursor, reset coords, and zoom on texture coordinates window 
  * Fix help links on Windows 
  * Fix several compilation warnings
