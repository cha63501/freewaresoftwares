**Publisher's Description**  
  


20-sim is an advanced modeling and simulation package for Windows. With 20-sim you can simulate the behavior of dynamic systems, such as electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems or any combination of these. 20-sim models may use iconic diagrams, bond graphs, block diagrams as well as differential equations. Used in mechatronics, control engineering, robotics, mechanical engineering, hydraulics etc. 

This is the full demonstration version of 20-sim 3.2 Pro! This demonstration version is a free full-working viewer. This means that all 20-sim toolboxes and libraries are available, and there are no restrictions on the number of submodels or states. This viewer allows you and your collegues to view and simulate 20-sim models. Get the functionality of Simulink from the same lab as Tutsim.
