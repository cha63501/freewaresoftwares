**Publisher's Description**  
  

Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language that provides a
natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing. Labels and equations
are typeset with LaTeX, for high-quality PostScript output.

A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it is a
programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program.

**Features:**

  * provides a portable standard for typesetting mathematical figures, just as TeX/LaTeX has become the standard for typesetting equations. 
  * inspired by MetaPost, with a much cleaner, powerful C++-like programming syntax and floating-point numerics; 
  * runs on all major platforms (UNIX, MacOS, Microsoft Windows). 
  * mathematically oriented (e.g. rotation of vectors by complex multiplication); 
  * LaTeX typesetting of labels (for document consistency); 
  * uses simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads) and objects that should scale with figure size; 
  * fully generalizes MetaPost path construction algorithms to three-dimensions; 
  * compiles commands into virtual machine code for speed without sacrificing portability; 
  * high-level graphics commands are implemented in the Asymptote language itself, allowing them to be easily tailored to specific applications;
