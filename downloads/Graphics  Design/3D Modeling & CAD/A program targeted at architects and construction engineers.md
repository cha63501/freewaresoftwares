**Publisher's Description**  
  


A program targeted at architects and construction engineers. 

Atlas computes the resulting moments and reaction forces for a given beam with loads applied to it (single as well as distributed), using CrossA' method.

A typical application would be to optimize joint positions (i.e. positions with zero moment) in purlins or beams.

The program has a very easy interface. It lets you enter your data with the mouse, and it shows the resulting moments and shear forces immediately in both a graphical and numerical way. Maximum bending moments can easily be calculated.This version can only handle one-dimensional structures or beams.
