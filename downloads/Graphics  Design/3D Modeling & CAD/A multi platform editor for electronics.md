**Publisher's Description**  
  


FidoCadJ is a very easy to use editor, with a library of electrical symbols and footprints (through hole and SMD). Drawings can be exported in several of graphic formats (PDF, EPS, PGF for LaTeX, SVG, PNG, JPG). Even if it is very simple, it can be still considered an Electronic design automation (EDA) software. 

FidoCadJ is inspired from FidoCad (without "J"), which was a vector graphic editor useful for electrical schematics and printed circuit boards. It uses a file format containing only 7-bit ASCII text, very compact and suited for copy and pasting from/into newsgroups and forum messages. This determined its success among the italian Usenet community, from late A'90s.

Unfortunately, FidoCad was able to run only on Microsoft Windows. This is the reason why I decided to write FidoCadJ, a small editor compatible with FidoCad, but multi-platform running on MacOSX, Linux and Windows. FidoCadJ is internationalized and its interface and manuals are available in english, french and italian. 

**Features:**

  * Draw electrical schematics and simple PCBs 
  * Export in a variety of graphic formats 
  * Multi platform 
  * Easy to use 
  * Compact text format, for copy/pasting in Usenet messages 
  * FidoCad compatible
