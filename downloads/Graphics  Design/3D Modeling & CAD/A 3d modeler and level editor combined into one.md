**Publisher's Description**  
  


DeleD is a 3D modeler and level-editor combined into one and is specifically designed to create static objects/worlds. It unites the functionality needed to create complex 3D scenes with an easy-to-understand userinterface: build entire worlds within an hour! 

The concepts behind DeleD are simple. Draw and manipulate 3D objects like cubes, polylines, spheres, rectangles, grids, pyramids, cylinders and more. Combine them into new 3D objects and use those to create complete scenes. Then use various types of lights like spotlights, directional lights or pointlights to bring your scene to life!

Anything you create with DeleD, either by using the LITE or the PRO version is license free. This means that you can use whatever you make with DeleD for your own purposes, whether commercially or not. No license fees, no legal strings.

Whatever you create with DeleD, is yours to use.
