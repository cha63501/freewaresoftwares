**Publisher's Description**  
  

20-sim is an advanced modeling and simulation package for Windows. With 20-sim
you can simulate the behavior of dynamic systems, such as electrical,
mechanical and hydraulic systems or any combination of these. 20-sim models
may use iconic diagrams, bond graphs, block diagrams as well as differential
equations. Used in mechatronics, control engineering, robotics, mechanical
engineering, hydraulics etc.

This is the full demonstration version of 20-sim 3.2 Pro! This demonstration
version is a free full-working viewer. This means that all 20-sim toolboxes
and libraries are available, and there are no restrictions on the number of
submodels or states. This viewer allows you and your collegues to view and
simulate 20-sim models. Get the functionality of Simulink from the same lab as
Tutsim.
