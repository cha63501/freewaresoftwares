If you think that all good Computer Aided Drawing (CAD) programs are
expensive, then LibreCAD will make you change your mind. This free 2D CAD
software seamlessly combines powerful CAD tools with ease of use. You donAt
have to be an architect or industrial designer to use the software: so long as
you enjoy using graphics, you will find it useful.

Since LibreCAD is an open source program, you can also contribute towards its
further development. Its GPLv2 public license allows you to use, copy and
customize it to suit your preferences. You also wonAt need to pay any license
costs.

**Installing LibreCAD**

We did not encounter any hitches when installing LibreCAD. Although the
software is free, we were taken to a link seeking donations soon after the
installation process. However, the donation was voluntary.

**Using LibreCAD**

When we launched the software for the first time, it asked us to choose our
preferred language and unit for measuring drawings. The default unit is
millimeter.

LibreCADAs user interface displays some layer tools and the working area. We
found it relatively easy to use the program, as the menu bar gave us access to
most of the categories we wanted, including Draw, Layer, Dimension and Block.
In addition, we could customize the interface by dragging its elements over
the working area and positioning them where we wanted.

Although we could use the mouse to locate the position of a point, we could
get more precise results by using the built-in command line.

LibreCAD gave us different drawing tools and items, including lines, ellipses,
circles, arcs and splines, which we could access in multiple iterations. For
instance, we could define circle parameters in five different modes. We
combined different shapes to create the model we wanted.

Grids make it easy to draw proportional objects even without using any
measurement. The scaling feature is especially useful if you are creating 2D
models for a large object. If you would like to use your project in a
presentation, then you can create stunning word effects using a feature known
as "Explode text into letters."

The program also allowed us to insert a picture we wanted to work on instead
of starting from scratch. The ability to zoom in and out allowed us to work
better of specific areas of our drawing and see how it would appear from
different distances.

The tabs above the working area enabled us to customize our designs by
choosing color and changing size. We could also customize the working area
itself.

**Pros**

  * Easy to use 
  * Ability to add unlimited layers 
  * Compatible with all major operating systems 
  * Multi-language 

**Cons**

  * DoesnAt support multiple print layouts 
  * No manual included
