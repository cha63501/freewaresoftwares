**Publisher's Description**  
  

Skyscraper aims to be a fully-featured, modular, 3D realtime building
simulator, powered by the Scalable Building Simulator (SBS) engine. Skyscraper
allows you to create your own buildings and experience them in full first-
person 3D. Skyscraper is perfect for those interested in highrise architecture
and elevators.

The main feature SBS provides is a very robust elevator simulator, but also
simulates general building features such as walls, floors, stairs, shaftwork
and more. Many more things are planned, including gaming support (single and
network multiplayer), and a graphical building designer.

Skyscraper is written in C++ and uses the Crystal Space 1.4 graphics engine,
the wxWidgets GUI library, and is multiplatform. All versions come with full
source code, under the GPL license.
