**Publisher's Description**  
  

Use the Camouflage plug-in to make army, fashion and animal camo. You can even
make patterns not found anywhere else.

You can control up to eight color layers. WeA've included a big set of
examples, which you can select from within the plug-in. Amongst them are real
army colors, both old and new. Many common fashion colors are also included as
well as a few animal colors.

The patterns the Camouflage plug-in makes donA't have any seams. This means
you can use them as textures. You can use the patterns for 3D models or as a
background for web sites. They can even be used as a pattern for clothing. The
patterns are seamless at any image size.

You can scale the pattern to fit your needs. The shape of the patterns can be
changed to look the way you want. You can save your settings and share them
with the rest of the world.

Camouflage works with most applications compatible with PhotoShop plug-ins for
WindowsA.
