**Publisher's Description**  
  

A single Photoshop compatible plug-in filter for creating a similar look when
using traditional B&W infra-red film.

It is not an exact match but will provide you with a quick and easy way to re-
create the effect digitally using your standard colour photographs.The RGB
sliders will also allow you to tint the overall image if you wish.

For best results use this filter on landscape scenes. It is also quite
effective on certain architectural elements too. Not really suitable for
portrait subjects though.

  * Easy to use dialog layout 
  * 7 slider controls 
  * Save your own presets (Windows only) 
  * Load and reuse presets (Windows only) 
  * Zoom preview area in/out 
Slider Controls
