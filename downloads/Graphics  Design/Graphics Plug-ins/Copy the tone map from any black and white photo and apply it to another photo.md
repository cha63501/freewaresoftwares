**Publisher's Description**  
  


AmphiSoft Photo Tinter is a Photoshop-compatible plug-in filter for extracting tone profile from toned black and white photos and applying extracted profiles to another photo. It is not yet another sepia effect - you may apply different tints to different areas of the photo, based on source brightness. 

For example, you may color shadows red, midtones green and highlights blue. Normally, it requires long tweaking of "Curves" facility in your image editor; now with Photo Tinter you may easily extract tone profiles from masterpieces you like with a click on a button.
