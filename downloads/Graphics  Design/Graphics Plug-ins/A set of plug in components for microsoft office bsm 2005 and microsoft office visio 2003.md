**Publisher's Description**  
  


The KPIDraw tool is a set of plug-in components for Microsoft Office Business Scorecard Manager 2005 (BSM2005) and Microsoft Office Visio 2003 (Visio). 

The set comprises the following components:

1) Diagram Viewer for BSM2005. This component allows the user to select and display a Visio diagram inside the BSM2005 Report View. The color of each shape on the Visio diagram follows the indicator associated to a KPI or an Objective.

2) Diagram Tool for BSM2005. This component adds a floating window that displays a tree of Scorecard Elements.

The set allows users to do the following:

  * Add a new KPI / Objective button 
  * Add a new KPI button to a Scorecard element 
  * Add an existing KPI button to a Scorecard element 
  * Associate, dissociate or delete buttons 
Note: The Diagram Tool doesnAt have a feature that accesses BSM2005 Scorecard data apart from KPIs or Objectives, nor does it have a feature to build Scorecard data from KPIDraw automatically, however, colors of any Visio shapes associated to BSM KPIs can be synchronized without any database coding by the tool. 

**System Requirements:**

  * Microsoft Office Business Scorecard Builder 2005 
  * Microsoft Office 2003 Visio 2003
