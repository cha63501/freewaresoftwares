**Publisher's Description**  
  

With the HarmonixA plug-in, you can mix harmonic frequencies into complex
waves.

Harmonix renders a single, horizontal line on the image, but this is no
ordinary line. It is the result of superimposing up to ten separate harmonic
frequencies, scaled to the screen.

You can change the up to ten harmonic frequencies in both amplitude
(volume/height) and phase (offset/shift) and have precise control over the
base frequency.

Use it to create realistic graphs or demonstrate how to create other basic
waveforms from nothing but carefully selected harmonic frequencies.

From the harmonic sine waves you can mix together the "primitive" square, saw
tooth and triangle waves but also more complex combinations.

Harmonix requires a PhotoshopA plug-in compatible graphics applications on
Windows.

**Features:**

  * Configure up to 10 harmonic frequencies. 
    * Amplitude. 
    * Phase. 
  * Base frequency fine-tuning. 
  * Automatic normalization of result wave. 
  * Reliable preview. 
  * Fully calculated. 
  * Fully documented in help system. 
  * Save and load settings. 
  * Supports 8-bit RGB mode
