**Publisher's Description**  
  

A single Photoshop compatible plug-in filter for quickly turning your colour
images into greyscale, but with the added option of using a coloured optical
lens filter as you would in traditional B&W photography.

The different colours will change the tonal range during the greyscale
conversion : for example, a red filter will lighten the red, magenta and
yellow areas plus darken the green, blue and cyan in the photo.

There are 6 preset effects to choose from using a simple drop-down menu
(Windows only - Mac versions come as 6 individual filters without dialog
boxes).

**Features:**

  * Easy to use dialog layout 
  * Single drop-down menu control 
  * 6 filter colour options 
  * Zoom preview area in/out 
Menu Controls

  * FC : Filter colour 
Compatible Image Modes: RGB 8 bit mode (24 bit images)

System Requirements: PC : Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP, plus any host graphics
application that supports the Photoshop *.8bf format plug-in standard.
