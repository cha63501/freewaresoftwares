**Publisher's Description**  
  

A single Photoshop compatible plug-in filter for very high contrast B&W
effects which are ideal for certain illustration work.

It bleaches out most of the mid-tone greys, leaving crisp dark blacks and
bright clean whites. It will produce clear B&W images with limited tones which
are suitable for cheap reproduction via the office photocopier or when
published in newsprint, as these methods normally loose image definition when
trying to reproduce standard colour photographs.

Although mainly designed for this "technical" purpose, you can also have fun
by adding strong colour-casts within the plug-in!

**Features:**

  * Easy to use dialog layout 
  * 4 slider controls 
  * Save your own presets (Windows only) 
  * Load and reuse presets (Windows only) 
  * Zoom preview area in/out 
Slider Controls

  * EC : Exposure compensation 
  * Colour : RGB balance 
Compatible Image Modes: RGB 8 bit mode (24 bit images)

System Requirements: PC : Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP, plus any host graphics
application that supports the Photoshop *.8bf format plug-in standard.
