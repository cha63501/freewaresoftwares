A single Photoshop compatible plug-in filter for quickly turning your colour images into greyscale, but with the added option of using a coloured optical lens filter as you would in traditional B&W photography.

**Features:**

  * Easy to use dialog layout 
  * Single drop-down menu control 
  * 6 filter colour options 
  * Zoom preview area in/out 
Menu Controls 
  * FC : Filter colour 
Compatible Image Modes: RGB 8 bit mode (24 bit images) 

System Requirements: PC : Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP, plus any host graphics application that supports the Photoshop *.8bf format plug-in standard.
