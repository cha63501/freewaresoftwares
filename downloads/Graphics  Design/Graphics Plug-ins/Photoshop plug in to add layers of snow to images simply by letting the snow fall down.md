**Publisher's Description**  
  


ItA's all going downhill, and thatA's where it belongs! With the SnowScape plug-in you will be able to add layers of snow to images simply by letting the snow fall down. 

You decide which areas the snow should fall down on by making the rest of the image transparent, you then start the plug-in, configure how much and where the snow should fall, and SnowScape does the rest.

You can also use SnowScape to do similar effects; make the snow less sticky, and you can create hills of sand. Apply it up-side down with high stickiness, and the ooze will be dripping down from your image. 

SnowScape requires a Photoshop plug-in compatible graphics applications on Windows. 

**Features:**

  * Anti-aliassed. 
  * Configurable placement balance. 
  * Control physics aspects of falling snow. 
  * Animation mode (watch the snow fall down). 
  * Fully documented in help system. 
  * Save and load settings. 
  * Supports 8-bit RGB mode.
