**Publisher's Description**  
  


A single Photoshop compatible plug-in filter for adding a basic "night-vision" effect to your digital photographs and/or 2D and 3D computer-generated images. 

It first removes all colour from the picture and gives a very slight blur to indicate the camera is trying hard to focus in a low-light situation. Then you can choose to add grain either keeping it B&W or mixing separate red, green and blue channels to vary the effect.

You can also produce a strong overall colour cast using the RGB sliders provided. Works best with dark night-time photographs that have minimal areas of bright background elements in the scene.

**Features:**

  * Easy to use dialog layout 
  * 8 slider controls 
  * Save your own presets (Windows only) 
  * Load and reuse presets (Windows only) 
  * Zoom preview area in/out 
Slider Controls 
  * EC : Exposure compensation 
  * Grain : Neutral or RGB noise 
  * Colour : RGB balance 
Compatible Image Modes: RGB 8 bit mode (24 bit images) 

System Requirements: PC : Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP, plus any host graphics application that supports the Photoshop *.8bf format plug-in standard.
