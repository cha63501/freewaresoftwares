**Publisher's Description**  
  

Image ReSizer simply resizes images with no messing about. Lets say you have
just come back from holiday and you want to quickly send those holiday snaps
to family and friends. Then you realize the size your 6 megapixel camera has
taken the photos at, 5mb per photo at 3053x2035 pixels. Far too big for your
average email or blog, and thatA's where Image ReSizer comes in.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
