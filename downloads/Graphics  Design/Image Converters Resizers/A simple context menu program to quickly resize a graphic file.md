**Publisher's Description**  
  


RightThumb was a program designed to quickly create thumbnails. However it gathered more and more options as a result of suggestions, comments and tinkering, including general resizing, so I have decided to re-launch it as RightThumb+. 

It remains a context menu program to quickly create a thumbnail or a resized image from a graphic file. It can identify and create a resized image from a wide range of graphic formats. The program will only resize a single file. 

However, you can select multiple files in Explorer and run RightThumb+ from the context menu which will result in multiple copies of the program running at the same time. You do not have to close the Options window to run the program from the context menu.
