**Publisher's Description**  
  


LuJoSoft Thumb Creator is a software to get thumbnails from any image. I have always had problems generating thumbnails from a large amount of images quickly and easily. Also standard graphic programs couldnA't meet my needs or it simply took too much time handling image after image. 

**What are Thumbnails?**  
Thumbnails are reduced-size versions of pictures, used to help in recognizing and organizing them, serving the same role for images as a normal text index does for words. In the age of digital images, visual search engines and image-organizing programs normally use thumbnails, as do most modern operating systems or desktop environments, such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, KDE, and GNOME.

**Overview**  
Some web designers produce thumbnails with HTML coding that makes the userA's browser shrink the picture, rather than use a smaller copy of the image. In principle the display size of an image in pixels should always correspond to its actual size, in part because one purpose of a thumbnail image on a web page is to reduce download time. The visual quality of browser resizing is also usually less than ideal.

**Benefits**  
This Thumbnail Generator is qualified for generating thumbnails of images you are publishing on the Internet. Pre-generated thumbnails save you processor utilization and disk space (if youA're generating thumbnails on the fly) - or userA's time and money. But also converting a large amount of images from one file format to another can be handled easily.

**Features:**

  * Image support 
  * Different file formats (BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF) - for both: source images and target thumbnails. 
  * Self specified thumbnail image prefix. 
  * Preview of source images and output thumbnails. 
  * Fixed width, height as well as maintaining aspect ratio. 
  * Bilinear re-sampling. 
Installation not required. Just download and run the executable. 

**System Requirements:**

  * Window XP, Windows Server 2003/2008, Vista and Windows 7. 
  * Windows installer 3.1. if not install the program will install it. 
  * .Net framework 3.5 SP1. if not install the program will install it.
