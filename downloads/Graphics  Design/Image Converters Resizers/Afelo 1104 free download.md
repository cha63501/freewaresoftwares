**Publisher's Description**  
  

Shrinking images has never been easier before. AFELO is a wizard based tool
allowing you to compress your pictures in just a few steps.

A very user-friendly interface takes you by the hand and guides you through
all the choices. Fetch the pictures from your camera or any folder on your
computer. Supported formats are JPEG, GIF and PNG. Choose the size of the
images in a context based manner e.g. using them in a web gallery, in a slide
show or embedded in a document. You can store the pictures locally on your
computer or upload them via FTP or OLEFA.

Another benefit is the automated generation of thumbnails and multiple
renaming possibilities. DonA't waste your time shrinking each image
separately. Lean back and enjoy watching AFELO completing your job.
