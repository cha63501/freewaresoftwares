**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Adobe DNG Converter, a free utility that converts files from more than 300 cameras to DNG, enables you to easily convert camera-specific raw files to a more universal DNG raw file. 

Digital Negative was developed to address the lack of an open standard for the proprietary and unique raw files created by each digital camera. DNG allows photographers to archive their raw camera files in a single format for easy cataloging and access in the future. With the format specification freely available, any developer can build software that supports and takes advantage of DNG. 

Visit the **[Camera Raw page**](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html) for a complete list of supported cameras.
