**Publisher's Description**  
  


Have you ever wanted to reduce the file size of an image without recompressing it? Well, I have! 

EXiFStripper removes EXIF (and IPTC) information from JPG/JPEG files and keeps the image data intact. This can reduce the file size by 45% on some files (usually 2-10% though)!

Really, really simple user interface. Just drag & drop, then click to start. Usually it finds most EXIF data on the first run, but you can run it again to do a deeper search and remove additional data.
