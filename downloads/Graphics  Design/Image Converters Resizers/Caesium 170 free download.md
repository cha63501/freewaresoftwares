**Publisher's Description**  
  

Caesium is handy tool that compresses the size of images while maintaining
image quality. The intuitive interface allows you to quickly process one or
multiple images simultaneously. Easily set the desired quality of the image,
the output format (JPG, PNG, BMP), and click "Compress". A built-in preview
feature allows you to view the "before" and "after" results.

In addition to the compression functions, Caesium also provides a batch image
resize feature to quickly resize multiple images. Details of images to be
processed are also displayed so that you can analyze the results after image
processing. View the Original/New Size, Original/New Resolution, the quality
of the image, and more.

Caesium proves to be a useful tool for web designers, bloggers, or individuals
who want to save hard drive space.
