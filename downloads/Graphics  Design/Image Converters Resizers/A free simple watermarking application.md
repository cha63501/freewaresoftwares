**Publisher's Description**  
  


imageMARKA is an easy to use watermarking application. Unlike many similar applications, the watermark graphic can be moved to the most suitable position before it is set. imageMARKA is not a batch processor. However opening or dragging multiple files from Explorer will create an internal list that can be navigated. To resize and watermark multiple images is particularly simple and quick. 

Images to be watermarked can be loaded, dragged from Explorer or pasted from clipboard. A large variety of graphic formats can be loaded or dragged but the output can only be saved as Bitmap, JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG image, Enhanced Metafile, GIF Image or TARGA Image.

In addition, the image can be rotated and resized. 

A watermark graphic can be loaded or created from text. Watermark graphics can be saved for future use.

imageMARKA can also be used to add text to an image by setting the transparency to 10.

This update is a much improved application that:

  * Adds the ability to process multiple files 
  * Undo last action 
  * Improved functions
