**Publisher's Description**  
  


Image aspect ratios are sometimes a bit tricky when it comes to viewing an image file. Most digital cameras use the standard 4:3 aspect ratio. If you have a 4:3 image you want to display or print as widescreen 16:9 or 8:5, you must either accept lots of white space, distortion by squeezing or stretching or try cropping it to fit. 

Cropping is easily done with most graphics program. However, there is not a great deal of help around for cropping to a specific aspect ratio. Image Ax is the perfect solution for this issue.

Update resolves a couple of bugs and improves re-sampling.
