**Publisher's Description**  
  

Easy, quick and handy (eqh). This is an application designed with those
criteria in mind. Whether you want to grab an image from your browser, capture
an area of your screen, paste an image from clipboard, drag an image file from
Explorer or simply load an image, this application does it all.

Having got your image, you can rotate it, resize it, crop it, give it a border
and apply graphic effects. When you are satisfied with your work, copy it to
clipboard, save in one of the common formats it or send it to your email
client.

Want a thumbnail? Dead easy. Open the image, drag the window to the size you
want, re-size the image and save. And it is mobile! If it suits, put it on a
USB stick and carry it with you!

**WhatA's New in version 2.2:**

  * Will now accept folder drop. 
  * Added option to allow oversize viewing/re-sizing. 
  * Cured a small memory leak and used a faster memory manager.
