**Publisher's Description**  
  


Resize Magic is a software that resizes images with a high quality algorithm, similar to the Lanczos algorithm used by other programs, with some modifications. 

When we talk about resizing an image, many people only think about giant posters. ThatAs true, Resize Magic will give you a better image than your graphic program when creating poster-size images, but it is designed for optimal performance when reducing the size of an image.

Resize Magic reduces the size of your images maintaining optimal sharpness. Note that it does NOT apply a sharpening filter after resizing, it simply works better. A sharpening filter gives a sharper appearance but cannot create details lost by low quality resizing. Resize Magic also does not create artifacts so your image always looks as it should be.
