**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Adobe DNG Converter, a free utility that converts files from more than 300
cameras to DNG, enables you to easily convert camera-specific raw files to a
more universal DNG raw file.

Digital Negative was developed to address the lack of an open standard for the
proprietary and unique raw files created by each digital camera. DNG allows
photographers to archive their raw camera files in a single format for easy
cataloging and access in the future. With the format specification freely
available, any developer can build software that supports and takes advantage
of DNG.

Visit the **[Camera Raw
page**](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html) for a complete
list of supported cameras.
