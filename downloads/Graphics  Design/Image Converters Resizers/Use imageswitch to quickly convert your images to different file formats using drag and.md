**Publisher's Description**  
  


Have you ever had a file ready for putting on the web or into a document, only to discover that its in the inefficient BMP format? You dont want to resize the image to make it smaller, but leaving it as a BMP will mean you cant use it on the web, and your document will be too big to email - so what can you do? One way to solve this problem is to change the image format to another, more efficient format such as PNG, which means significantly smaller files. 

ImageSwitch allows you use the same simple, intuitive drag and drop method to quickly and simply convert images between common file types without the time consuming hassle and confusion thats usually involved when using an expensive photo editing package. 

Because ImageSwitch has been designed to be quick and simple to use above all else, you wont find a collection of exotic file types to chose from or a bewildering selection of options to tweak and fine tune the conversion process - weA've selected the most common file types already so you can just select which format you want your images to be converted to and youA're all set and ready to go. ImageSwitch can convert to and from any of the following image formats:

  * BMP
  * GIF
  * JPG
  * PNG
  * TIFF

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
