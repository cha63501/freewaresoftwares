**Publisher's Description**  
  

ThumbZipper creates thumbnails and stores them in a standard zip archive
rather than saving them to disk. Using an efficient re-size engine, images can
be quickly created from a files list. They can be framed using selectable
colors. The frame can be either the same size around the image or it can be
square with the image set centrally.

**WhatA's New in Version 1.1:**

  * Managed to mess up the sizing function in previous release! Now works as it should. Also added a STOP button, just in case.
