**Publisher's Description**  
  

Resize Magic is a software that resizes images with a high quality algorithm,
similar to the Lanczos algorithm used by other programs, with some
modifications.

When we talk about resizing an image, many people only think about giant
posters. ThatAs true, Resize Magic will give you a better image than your
graphic program when creating poster-size images, but it is designed for
optimal performance when reducing the size of an image.

Resize Magic reduces the size of your images maintaining optimal sharpness.
Note that it does NOT apply a sharpening filter after resizing, it simply
works better. A sharpening filter gives a sharper appearance but cannot create
details lost by low quality resizing. Resize Magic also does not create
artifacts so your image always looks as it should be.
