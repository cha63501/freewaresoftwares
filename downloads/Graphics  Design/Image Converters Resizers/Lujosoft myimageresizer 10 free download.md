**Publisher's Description**  
  

Every week I take dozens of pictures. Most of these pictures are placed on a
web site. And every week I find myself performing the ever recurring task of
resizing the images (mostly 3072 x 2048) to something more friendly (e.g.: 768
x 512).

Why? Just for those less fortunate that have no ADSL or so. Of course, every
repeating task is prone to be automated, and a first application was born to
resize the pictures according to my wishes. To cope with different source and
target paths, as well as different ways of resizing, the application needed a
user interface.

Working on the application and its (simple, yet effective) user interface,
generalizing the use of the application is evident. The next step then is to
share it with all of you and hope you find the application useful.
