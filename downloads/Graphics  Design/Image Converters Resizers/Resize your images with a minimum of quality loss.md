**Publisher's Description**  
  


TinyPic is an automatic file resizer. It selects an optimized balance between file size and image quality. The files will be reduced to 20-80kB with a minimum of Quality loss. The main purpose is to shrink pictures for emails, and the user interface is so easy to use that anybody can use the program. 

The pictures will be resized and saved again. You can select different ways to preserve your original pictures:

  1. Save to the same folder with extended name (i.e. K1024_oldname.JPG) 
  2. Save to a subfolder (i.e. K1024\\) 
  3. Override the original files (!) Be careful: the original files will be lost. 
The result files have a size which is suitable for mailing. TinyPic automatically selects the best compromise between quality and size without asking the user too much questions. The files will be shrinking to 3-10% of the original size without a too big quality loss.
