except they are created out of colored ASCII characters. mosascii m2 has lots
of features, such as image actions and effects, different modes for the
mosaics (custom text, numbers, letters, binary, hex, and smart text). mosascii
m2 can be used for fun, or for educational use, for example, if you are doing
a project on President Abraham Lincoln, you can create a mosaic of his picture
using the text of the Gettysburg Address.
