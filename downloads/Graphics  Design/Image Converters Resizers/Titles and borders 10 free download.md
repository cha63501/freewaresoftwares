**Publisher's Description**  
  

Images with an explanatory title or a little text have, in the main, more
relevance than those without. However, few graphic applications provide an
easy option to simply add some text. Titles & Borders is designed to provide
that option.

A border can be added to an existing image with or without an additional area
for text. An image can be resized or a piece cropped from it. Text can be
added anywhere on the image, horizontally or vertically. In addition, the
image can be watermarked.

A wide range of image formats will be accepted for processing. Images can be
saved in JPEG, PNG, GIF, Bitmap or EMF formats.
