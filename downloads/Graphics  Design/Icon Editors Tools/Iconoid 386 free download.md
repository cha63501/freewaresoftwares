**Publisher's Description**  
  

Iconoid runs either as a system tray icon, or completely hidden. It watches
where your cursor moves and looks for changes to the desktop.

When the cursor moves off of the desktop, Iconoid might hide the desktop icons
so that you can see the wallpaper better. When you move the mouse back to the
desktop, the icons reappear.

Iconoid also looks for changes to the wallpaper (file size or name) and if it
sees that the wallpaper has changed, it forces the icon colors back to your
specifications (color or transparent).

**Features:**

  * Make icon backgrounds transparent 
  * Select any color for icon backgrounds 
  * Save and Restore Icon positions for each (or every) screen resolution 
  * Select any color for icon text 
  * Automatically or manually select the best color for the text background 
  * Dynamically hide icons when you donA't need them and show them when you do 
  * Quickly minimize all windows so that you can see your desktop wallpaper. 

**WhatA's New in version 3.8.6:**

  * Remove help from program and point to web so people get FAQs answered quickly 
  * Changed compiler to Visual Studio Express 2010. 
  * Remove Windows 98 compatibility because of compiler restriction.
