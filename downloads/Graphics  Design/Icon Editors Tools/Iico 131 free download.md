**Publisher's Description**  
  

iICO is an extremely versatile free icon editor for Windows. It is capable of
handling both icon and cursor files, plus the semitransparent icons in Windows
XP.

It can accept input from a wide variety of formats, converting them smoothly
to icon size with very little loss of clarity. Many Mintra Systems product
icons (including the one for iICO) were made using this program. A full set of
help pages is included with the product.
