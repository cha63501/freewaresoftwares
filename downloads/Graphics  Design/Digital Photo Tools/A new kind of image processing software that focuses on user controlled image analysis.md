**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pixcavator is a new kind of image analysis software. It does not assume anything about what is or is not important in the image. ThatA's for the user to decide. The goal is lossless analysis - there is no loss of information, no approximation, and no round-up errors. 

Pixcavator first captures (and counts) all objects in the image and then simplifies it by removing objects indicated by the user. The output is completely context independent.
