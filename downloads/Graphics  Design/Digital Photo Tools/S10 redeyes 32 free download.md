**Publisher's Description**  
  

S10 RedEyes is a sophisticated red-eye removal program that also functions as
a general purpose photo editor. It features a circular/elliptical eye
selection tool - not rectangular as in other programs - and it smoothly
removes redness, with pixel blending along the perimiter (anti-aliasing).

Eye brightness, pupil brightness, and eye color are all adjustable. For severe
cases where the flash has entirely wiped out the structure of the eye, a
"replacement eye" option is available.

General photo editing capabilities include rotating, resizing, cropping,
adjusting brightness, and correcting tilt. A navigation toolbar makes it easy
to cycle through all photos in a folder. Also includes printing capabilility
with instant preview.

S10 RedEyes is digitally signed, compact (262KB), easy to use, and free.
