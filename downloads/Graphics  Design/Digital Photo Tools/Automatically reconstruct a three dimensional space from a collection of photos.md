**Publisher's Description**  
  


Automatically reconstruct a three-dimensional space from a collection of photos of a place or an object. 

Whether sharing or reliving a vacation destination or exploring a distant museum or landmark, Photosynth transforms regular digital photos into a three-dimensional, 360-degree experience with a digital camera and your own creativity and inspiration. 

You can share or relive a vacation destination or explore a distant museum or landmark. With a nothing more than digital camera and some inspiration, you can use Photosynth to transform regular digital photos into a three-dimensional, 360-degree experience. Anybody who sees your synth is put right in your shoes, sharing in your experience, with detail, clarity and scope impossible to achieve in conventional photos or videos.

Synths constitute an entirely new visual medium. Photosynth analyzes each photo for similarities to the others, and uses that data to build a model of where the photos were taken. It then re-creates the environment and uses that as a canvas on which to display the photos.
