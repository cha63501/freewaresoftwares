**Publisher's Description**  
  

Digi-Annotator started life as a relatively simple program designed to add a
note to a digital photo. It has grown into much more. It is now a tool you can
use to enhance your digital images and create not only images with notes but
photographs you can be proud to keep and show.

Creating digital e-cards from your own photos and emailing directly from Digi-
Annotator is extremely simple. Creating images suitable for use on a web page
couldnA't be easier. Making catalogue and instructional pictures takes no time
at all. Children can use Digi-Annotator to produce creative graphics in
support of project work. And much more...

With Digi-Annotator you can take a graphic image directly from source, resize
it to a more manageable size, annotate it (and possibly A'watermarkA' it) ,
add interesting borders and graphics, convert it and save it, print it and
email it.
