**Publisher's Description**  
  


DeepSkyStacker is a freeware for astrophotographers that simplifies all the pre-processing steps of deep sky pictures. 

  * Registering 
  * Stacking 
  * Simple post-stacking processes to quickly view the final result. 
  * Saving the resulting picture to a TIFF file (16 or 32 bit) 
After a shooting night you give all your pictures (light frames, darks frames, offset/bias frames, flat frames) to DeepSkyStacker and you go to bed. The next morning (or is it afternoon?) you can see the result and start post-processing. 

**Features:**

  * Automatic registration of a set of pictures 
  * Automatic detection of stars using all the picture area 
  * Preview of registered stars 
  * Sub pixel registration 
  * Automatic derotation 
  * Automatic creation and use of offsets, flats and darks frames 
  * Sub pixel alignment and stacking 
  * Supported bitmaps formats : 8, 16 and 32 bit colour and monochrome TIFF files, 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit colour and monochrome FITS files, JPEG, BMP, PNG 
  * Native use of RAW files from most DSLRs (CR2, NEF, CRW, ...) without using an intermediate file format (TIFF or other). 
  * Darks, Flats and Offsets computed from and applied directly to the RAW picture before any interpolation. 
  * Stacking methods: average, median, kappa-sigma clipping, auto adaptive weighted average, entropy weighted average, maximum... 
  * Preview of all pictures (including RAW) 
  * Simple post-processing with RGB levels, luminance curve and saturation adjustments. 
  * Save the resulting picture to 16 or 32 bit TIFF files with or without adjustments applied. 
  * Simple and intuitive user interface 
  * Optimal memory usage: the same amount of memory is required to register and stack 10 or 500 pictures.
