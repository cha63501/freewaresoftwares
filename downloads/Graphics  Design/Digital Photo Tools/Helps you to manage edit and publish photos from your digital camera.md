Managing your collection: PhotoMeister includes a number of easy-to-use features such as copying photos, importing photos into albums (from existing folders on your hard drive, from a digital camera, or from a TWAIN-compliant source like a scanner), dumping photos (from an album), and deleting photos (to the Windows Recycle Bin). 

3\. Editing photos: you donA't need to be an AdobeA PhotoshopA(r) guru to handle the basic editing of your photos.
