**Publisher's Description**  
  

Picture-shark gives you the ability to watermark and copyright your picture
galleries. You can use logos, text or any other images. With its wizardlike
interface you can easily create impressive results. Picture-shark processes
hundreds of pictures each minute. It supports transparence and realtime
preview. The unique feather feature generates smart edges with one click. And
the best: ItA's free.

Picture-shark beats all other products in speed, compatibility with all
windows operating systems, the small file size and its realtime preview. After
once setting position, transparent color, opacity and feather (smart edges),
these settings are applied in batchmode to all choosen pictures regardless of
their size. Standard file-formats and different jpg-compressions are
supported.

Picture-sharkA's impressive advantage - compared to other products - is itA's
"feather"-feature. It smoothes the edges between the "stamp" and the picture.
It applies anti-aliasing to the stamp and removes the "edged" borders that are
known from many galleries on the net.

The clear userinterface allows even unexperienced users to get impressive
results.

During development all useless and confusing features were left out. But still
the comfort that the user knows from using Windows is still available.

Product-support is very important. You can reach the technical support via
e-mail and phone for free and there are various tutorials on picture-sharkA's
homepage.

Picture Shark is free for personal, non-commercial use only.
