**Publisher's Description**  
  

Automatically reconstruct a three-dimensional space from a collection of
photos of a place or an object.

Whether sharing or reliving a vacation destination or exploring a distant
museum or landmark, Photosynth transforms regular digital photos into a three-
dimensional, 360-degree experience with a digital camera and your own
creativity and inspiration.

You can share or relive a vacation destination or explore a distant museum or
landmark. With a nothing more than digital camera and some inspiration, you
can use Photosynth to transform regular digital photos into a three-
dimensional, 360-degree experience. Anybody who sees your synth is put right
in your shoes, sharing in your experience, with detail, clarity and scope
impossible to achieve in conventional photos or videos.

Synths constitute an entirely new visual medium. Photosynth analyzes each
photo for similarities to the others, and uses that data to build a model of
where the photos were taken. It then re-creates the environment and uses that
as a canvas on which to display the photos.
