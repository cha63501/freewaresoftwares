**Publisher's Description**  
  

S10 WebAlbums enables you to easily create elegant online photo albums and
publish them to your own personal web space. An instant Web View feature
eliminates the clumsy "wizards" and lengthy HTML generation found in other
programs. The program provides drag-and-drop adding/reordering, thumbnail
view, titles/descriptions, as well as photo editing capabilities - rotating,
cropping, adjusting brightness, correcting tilt, and fixing red eyes (the same
red-eye removal tool that is also available separately as S10 RedEyes).

Customization is simple with the included themes, color palette, pattern
library, border styles, and layout options. Techniques such as gradient
shading, drop shadows, and transition effects give your album a professional
look.

Other features include support for multiple photo sizes (visitors can choose
S/M/L), auto-play slideshow, built-in FTP upload, automatic list-of-albums
page generation, multi-language web controls, and a full-screen web view
utility for local viewing.

S10 WebAlbums is digitally signed, compact (465KB), easy to use, and free.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
