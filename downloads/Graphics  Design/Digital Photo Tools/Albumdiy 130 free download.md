**Publisher's Description**  
  

AlbumDIY is a tool to create book-like digital photo albums that can be viewed
on the local computer or distributed as .EXE file. The album looks like a
virtual book, with background music, text comments, clipart and more.

Your pictures can be freely positioned on the pages, resized, stretched,
rotated and adjusted. You can also add many artistic frames and masks to your
photos, creating a unique and professional look for each of your album pages.

The program is easy to use and offers wizard-style dialogs. Additional
features include slideshow, full-screen viewing and picture-only mode.
