**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Rasterbator is an application which creates rasterized versions of images.
The rasterized images can be printed and assembled into enormous (or smaller,
if you prefer) posters. Enter the online Rasterbation Gallery to see what the
images look like.

The Rasterbator originated as a web application at homokaasu.org, but it has
gained so much popularity that the web server occassionally cannot handle the
load and a standalone version was in place.

The standalone version is the same as the web version, except that downloading
images from the web and image cropping are not supported, and you have to set
the output size numerically (number of pages wide/high) rather than using a
fancy drag handle. The results are exactly the same.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/det
