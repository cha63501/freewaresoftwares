**Publisher's Description**  
  

Posterizia enables you to create poster or banner size prints from your
digital images. The program slices the images into multiple parts and makes
them fit into a number of regular size pages (A4, A3, letter, etc.), which can
then be assembled after printing. It automatically includes margins to overlap
and glue the pages. In addition, you can add up to 4 lines of text, as well as
a frame to enhance the looks. The program is easy to use, and offers easy
configuration and previews of the results. You can create regular size
posters, wall posters or anything in between, although you should use a high
resolution image for larger printouts in order to produce quality results. The
program can also save the output as JPG files, allowing you to use 3rd party
printing services instead of your own printer.
