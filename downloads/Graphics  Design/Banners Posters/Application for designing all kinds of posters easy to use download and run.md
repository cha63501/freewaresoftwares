**Publisher's Description**  
  


Posterizia enables you to create poster or banner size prints from your digital images. The program slices the images into multiple parts and makes them fit into a number of regular size pages (A4, A3, letter, etc.), which can then be assembled after printing. It automatically includes margins to overlap and glue the pages. In addition, you can add up to 4 lines of text, as well as a frame to enhance the looks. The program is easy to use, and offers easy configuration and previews of the results. You can create regular size posters, wall posters or anything in between, although you should use a high resolution image for larger printouts in order to produce quality results. The program can also save the output as JPG files, allowing you to use 3rd party printing services instead of your own printer.
