**Publisher's Description**  
  

Truespace 7.61 is a fully-featured 3D authoring package that will let you
model, texture, light, animate and render 3D content. As well as traditional
images and movies, you can also make 3D content for online shared spaces, and
for Virtual Earth.

Truespace features quick easy character animation and physics. 1000 frames
real time can be rendered in a couple minutes.

An entirely re-written X format exporter lets you save your trueSpace
creations to load into game engines such as XNA to develop games for Windows
or the Xbox 360.

Also included is an export to Virtual Earth which will let you place your 3D
creations straight into Virtual Earth from trueSpace. Now you can place
whatever you make into real world locations in Virtual Earth and share them
with others!

trueSpace also supports import from a wide variety of formats, letting you
take existing objects and use them in Virtual Earth.
