**Publisher's Description**  
  


If you want to convert GIF animations to animated PNG or APNG, then gif2apng is an ideal tool for you. The application does not only make a smooth conversion but also helps you save space. While it is commonly believed that APNG files are always unreasonably large, gif2apng actually creates smaller files than the original animated GIFs. 

The output file-size will depend on the type of GIF animation being converted. On average, you should expect to get a difference of between 20 and 25 percent from the original file sizes.

The program allows you to convert either a single GIF file or all GIFs in the selected directory.

You can use gif2apng as a command-line program, which should not scare you since the command-line is straight forward. If you are not comfortable with using command lines, however, you can get the Windows version that gives you a graphical user interface. The command-line version is available for all major operating systems.
