**Publisher's Description**  
  

OpenFX is an Open-Source 3D modeling, animation, and rendering suite.

A powerful feature-set includes a full renderer and raytrace engine, NURBS
support, kinematics-based animation, morphing, and an extensive plug-in API.
Plugin capabilities include image post processor effects such as lens flare,
fog and depth of field.

Animation effects such as explosions, waves and dissolves add enormously to
the flexibility of the program.
