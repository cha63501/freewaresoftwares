**Publisher's Description**  
  

Put together dynamic characters easily with Skeleton. Using only a handful of
separate graphics (an arm, a head, a body, and a torso, for instance), you can
design a skeleton for your character and apply images to it. Bend your
character and see it come to life as all the sprites are automatically moved
and rotated with the skeleton. Saves tons of time when putting together the
sprites for your next game.

Skeleton features custom skeletons in any shape you need. Create humans,
animals, insects, and birds, or simply use the program to animate the
suspension on a car. Use Skeleton for anything you need to animate motion
into.
