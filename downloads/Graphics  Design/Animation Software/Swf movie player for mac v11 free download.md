**Publisher's Description**  
  

SWF Movie Player is a new free SWF player for Mac OS based on Macromedia Flash
player which helps you to get best experience from flash movies.

SWF Movie Player by Eltima Software offers advanced and unique features that
allow you to play, rewind, fast-forward and preview SWF files frame-by-frame,
and also create and manage playlists, zoom movies in and out, fit to current
window size or restore to original one, set playback quality, control Flash
security, check SWF comprehensive information and lots more.

The special unique algorithms were developed for this product to check whether
the Flash movie has been finished or not (which is not always a simple task
since quite a few of SWF files are not played till the ending frame or play
repeatedly). With SWF Movie Player you can easily switch into a zoom mode and
see zoomed image boundaries as well as navigate within a Zoom Drawer. When a
zoom mode is activated, you can disable dragging and use all interactive
controls that SWF file provides.

Now, it is possible to apply security options and run SWF files in the
sandbox. This feature allows you to restrict the SWF file queries to non-local
resources (URL/images/third-party SWF files) and to prevent unwonted access to
the web. Developed by people and for people the SWF Movie Player has truly
user-friendly interface and customizable options which let you easy manage
Flash movie and enjoy movie playing. And the best feature is that you get it
all absolutely for FREE!
