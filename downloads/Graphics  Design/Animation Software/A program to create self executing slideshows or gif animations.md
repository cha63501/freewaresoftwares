A program to create self-executing slideshows or GIF-animations.

  * .SCR-file (screensaver-file, can be used as screensaver) 
  * .GIF-file (animated GIF image) 
  * New: .SWF-file (flash slideshow) 
The display time for each picture can be set for the complete sildeshow or individually per picture. For .EXE- or .SCR-files you have also the possiblity to add a background music file. You may install this program together with Alternate Pic View and it integrates itself into the Tools-menu.
