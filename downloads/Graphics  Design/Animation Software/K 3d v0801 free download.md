**Publisher's Description**  
  

K-3D is the free-as-in-freedom 3D modeling, animation, and rendering system.
K-3D features a robust, object-oriented plugin architecture, designed to scale
to the needs of professional artists, and is designed from-the-ground-up to
generate motion-picture-quality animation using RenderMan-compliant render
engines. We strongly recommend the Aqsis render engine for use with K-3D.

K-3DA's innovative interactive tutorial system will introduce you to basic use
of the program. New tutorials can easily be recorded and shared with the rest
of the community.

K-3D allows you to create and edit documents in multiple realtime OpenGL
solid, shaded, texture-mapped views. You can even model, animate, and interact
with animations while they play back for maximum productivity!
