**Publisher's Description**  
  

A program to create self-executing slideshows or GIF-animations.

The program supports several image formats and can create slideshow output
files as the following formats (the generated output files can then be
provided without this program):

  * .EXE-file (selfexecuting, can be burned to CD or sent via e-mail) 
  * .SCR-file (screensaver-file, can be used as screensaver) 
  * .GIF-file (animated GIF image) 
  * New: .SWF-file (flash slideshow) 
The display time for each picture can be set for the complete sildeshow or
individually per picture. For .EXE- or .SCR-files you have also the possiblity
to add a background music file. You may install this program together with
Alternate Pic View and it integrates itself into the Tools-menu.
