**Publisher's Description**  
  


Screen captures have never been easier. By default, ScreenCaptureX saves either a window, a section of your screen, or the entire screen as a JPEG file. You can also change the default format to either PNG or PICT as well. You control what the default name is and ScreenCaptureX will number them sequentially as you take them. You also can control where the final file ends up, so instead of cluttering your desktop, you can specify a target folder. A one line caption can quickly be added to each screen shot immediately after it is captured. This is especially great for creating web-based tutorials quickly and easily. 

**New in this version:**

  * Version 1.4 adds a Save-as checkbox in the preferences which will lock in whatever file format you have checked and will allow you to rename the files as you capture them or after you add the caption.
