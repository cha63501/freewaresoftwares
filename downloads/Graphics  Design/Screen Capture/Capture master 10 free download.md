**Publisher's Description**  
  

Capture Master is a simple but powerful screen capture device.

It consist of two parts; one main form and one red border. Everything within
the red border will be captured. To move the border push and hold CTRL and
drag on the red area of the border. To resize it use the right side, the
bottom or the bottomright corner of the border.

Use the "Simple Capturing" page for easy capturing. Look in "Advanced
Capturing" for more features. The "Minimize This" button minimizes only main
form, not the red border.
