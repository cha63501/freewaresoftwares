**Publisher's Description**  
  


An open-source screen capture program that allows for region/window/full-screen screenshots.  
  
ZScreen supports Region/Window/Full-screen screenshots. Eight different file formats including png, jpeg, and bitmap are supported. Image quality adjustment is supported for jpeg images. When file sizes become too large with a specified format users can optionally specify another format to switch to after a specified file size limit has been reached.   
  
Users can also optionally save images to either FTP or Clipboard. When saving to FTP the URL is copied into clipboard with a single keystroke so that a user may paste that link via irc, email, im, etc. There is a history section that stores the URL to every screenshot that has been uploaded so that a person may just copy and paste multiple URLs off to someone via a chat medium.   
  
ZScreen uses custom automatic naming conventions with variables such as %mi to retrieve the current minute (or %t to get the title of the active window for instance) are supported. It also can interface with image editing software such as Microsoft Paint, Paint.NET or Adobe Photoshop so that editing may be done before a screenshot is uploaded, saved, or put in clipboard.   
  
ZScreen features a very silent operation as it can just be set up once and then left alone. Everything that needs to be used regularly can be accessed from the right click menu. Three hotkeys (active window, cropped shot, and full screen) make it easy so that you do not need to unnecessarily open up the program window. Crop shots (region capture) can be captured and the URL given out to someone else in less steps then any other program in existence.   
  
Here is the entire process of taking a crop shot with no steps left out. Press your hot key (control + shift + l for instance), click your left mouse button once and drag down and right, and release. Instanteously paste into a chat window (control + v for instance) and press enter.
