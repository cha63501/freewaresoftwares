**Publisher's Description**  
  

MiniCap is a minimal screenshot capture app, with good commandline support,
including the ability to launch (and then terminate) apps, capture windows by
handle, processid, process name, or interactively.

MiniCap has a convenient interactive capture mode (based on Screenshot
CaptorA's Redbox Capture mode) which may be useful if you donA't want to have
something like Screenshot Captor running in the background. But where MiniCap
really shines is itA's use as a non-interactive commandline tool.
