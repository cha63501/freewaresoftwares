**Publisher's Description**  
  

**CaptureScreen is easy to use:**  
Right-click for contextual menu access. Move and size the window to the
desired location, and select the "Capture" command for a region capture of the
screen, or the "Full Screen" command for a full capture of the screen. Save
the capture with the "Save" command; png format (by default) gives a perfect
result. The "Clear" command erases the capture.

You can easily capture and manipulate a screen portion, e.g., compare two
texts or two images. The "Show All" command shows the full menu and all
commands.

**CaptureScreen includes advanced options:**  
The "Thumbnail..." command allows you to save a thumbnail (or a enlargement)
of the capture (with a Preview command). Image effects (Lighten, Darken,
GrayScale, Invert, Contrast, Color, RGB ...) and special effects (Selective
GrayScale, Color To Transparent, Psychedelic, B/W Sketch, Color Emboss...) are
available with the "Effects" menu. Multi-level Undo and Redo are also
available.

By double-click, if CaptureScreen is your image editor by default, you can
open and edit images and saved captures. In "More Commands" menu, you can use
the "Open and Mix" or the "Capture and Mix" commands, to mix and merge images
and captures.

The "Transparent Mode" command preserves the window and the image in
transparency: you can use the capture like a tracing paper. The "No Border
Mode" command allows you to hide windowA's border; you can open by example
several instances of CaptureScreen to make a photomontage. All image effects
are available in a selection rectangle with the "Selection Mode".

The "CaptureScreen Options" allows you to set and save user settings (Hotkeys
for menus commands, Run in "No Border Mode", Transparency, Delay Time, JPG
Quality...). The "JPG Quality" Options allows you to reduce the file size of
the image (saved in JPG/JPEG format). Settings are also automatically saved to
a text file, when closing the application.

This program works with all version of Windows from 98 up to Windows 7. If
your system is Windows XP or older, it requires the [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-
Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) or higher.
