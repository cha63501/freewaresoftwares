Window Clippings is a small interesting tool that allows you to select any top-level window and capture an image of it. To begin, simply double-click the Window Clippings icon in the notification area (next to the Clock) or press the keyboard hot key that you configured using the Window Clippings options. 

Window Clippings will by default simply save the image to the location you choose. You can however instruct it to prompt you for a file name and location every time a window clipping is created. Four image formats are supported when saving to disk. Choose the format that is most appropriate for your needs.
