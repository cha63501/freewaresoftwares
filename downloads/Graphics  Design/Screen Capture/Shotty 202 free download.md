**Publisher's Description**  
  

Shotty is an application to take pictures of your computer screen (called
screenshots) or from one application only.

Unlike other applications, Shotty provides various other features that are
useful to modify the taken screenshot.

**Features:**

  * Shotty takes screenshot in high quality, including aero glass frame transparency and shadow (only if running on Windows Vista or above). 
  * Shotty offers the possibility to let you modify the taken screenshot with tools like crop image, unsharpen a region to make text unreadable, highlight text like with a marker or to draw rectangles. Of course you can add text on your screenshot, also. 
  * It just works, even with one key. Just press the hotkey (default is [Ctrl]+[Print]) and the image gets uploaded to the internet, saved on your computer or copied to the clipboard. Another alternative is to automatically open the internal image editor where you can edit it and choose what to do with it. 
  * It is freeware! You donA't need to pay a cent for it. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
