**Publisher's Description**  
  

Use Screenshoter as a very easy and intuitive tool for capturing your screen -
ItA's uncomplicated, portable and free.

Every unnecessary feature has been kept out without exception. Click on the
button or push the "Print Screen" key on your keyboard and the screen will be
directly saved as an image - Done!

ItA's still possible to customize all settings: Capture just a certain area of
the screen or the currently active window, display the mouse cursor or set the
saving image format (JPG, PNG or BMP). Other features such as setting up the
image quality and automatically copying the screenshot to the clipboard are
available as well.

Moreover Screenshoter has a special "Compact mode" and can be minimized to the
tray so it doesnA't block your work. Worth mentioning is that full screen
applications can be captured as well. With this advantage itA's easily
possible to create high quality screenshots of games, websites, office
programs and even movies!

Screenshoter is the right choice if you prefer a simple program to a complex
one. It doesnA't need an installation, is powerful but easy to understand and
best of all: Completely free of charge!

Not special system requirements.
