Screen Capture is a screenshot tool! It will take screenshots with the touch of a single button, and will automatically save them without the hassle of doing it yourself! You can even use the 1-key keyboard hotkey, the default PrintScreen button, but instead it will capture your screen, save it, and even preview the picture right after itA's taken if you set it to! 

Screen Capture has the ability to change the default screenshot save directory, the option to show previews after captures, and all of your settings are saved in the registry, you never set an option twice!
