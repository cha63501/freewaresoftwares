**Publisher's Description**  
  

ImageGrab allows you to extract images from all kind of videos avi, mpeg, wmv,
live video streams, not encrypted DVDs, and many more. The captured image can
be saved to a drive in either .bmp or .jpg format. The jpeg-quality is
adjustable. You may even copy it in the clipboard, in order to use it in your
favorite application.

**Features:**

  * it can save the preferences in order to find them at next start of the program. 
  * building file names by adding numbers is possible with any number of digits. 
  * the command line switches are now very powerful, and even integrated in the Windows interface 
  * it can open the source or dest folders with a click 
  * there are more keyboard shortcuts and they are listed in the Settings panel 
  * Volume of sound can be adjusted 
This application heavily uses directshow filters (directX video functions). So
be sure to have directshow filters (also known as codecs) correctly installed
for the videos which you want to operate.

There is no need of an installation, just launch the exe-file. Nothing is
copied onto the hard-disks or to the register at start. So uninstall it just
by deleting the exe-file. If you saved the preferences (either to the registry
or an ini-file, delete the prefernces before deleting the exe-file - see in
F10, panel "preferences").

**What's New in version 5.0.6:**

  * a serious bug during inlay of text in the video has been fixed 
  * code has been cleaned and optimized 
  * the video is less jerky when the state changes 
  * the current image is copied into the clipboard and no more the previous snapshot 
  * the intervalometer in normal mode has been fixed to extract the correct images
