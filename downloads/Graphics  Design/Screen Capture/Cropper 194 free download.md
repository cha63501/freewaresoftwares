**Publisher's Description**  
  

Cropper is a screen capture utility written in C# on the Microsoft .Net
platform. It makes it fast and easy to grab parts of your screen. Use it to
easily crop out sections of vector graphic files such as Fireworks without
having to flatten the files or open in a new editor. Use it to easily capture
parts of a web site, including text and images. ItA's also great for writing
documentation that needs images of your application or web site.

The files are saved straight to a folder of your choice in the format you
specify or to the clipboard or printer. No more A'Print ScreenA'... open image
editor... paste from clipboard... crop... export. Just double-click the form
or press enter, and whatever is visible below the form is captured.

The source code is freely available with shared source licensing. The license
information is available in each class file.
