**Publisher's Description**  
  


SCWebCam will function like a webcam, except will upload your computer screen instead of using a camera and taking a picture of you LOOKING at your PC screen. (If you have a camera, however, you can even integrate the video image into the capture!). 

**Features:**

  * Automatic capture and FTP Upload with configurable timer 
  * Tabbed configuration interface, and relatively human-readable error messages 
  * Saves image as JPG or PNG with variable quality, size, and thumbnail functionality. (Or 24-bit BMP with sizing and thumbnail). Choice of several image resize engines to balance quality with speed, and image can be sized by percentage or absolute pixel size 
  * Optionally minimizes to the system tray, with visible countdown and single-click pause 
  * Detects screen saver, locked workstation, and logoff/shutdown, and can upload an A'offlineA' image at those times 
  * Capture can run in several reduced priority modes to minimize the impact to your system - good for games! 
  * Can automatically detect modem connections, and operate only when the modem is connected (experimental!) 
  * Autorun and Autostart available 
  * Text caption with selectable font, color and location 
  * Ability to capture the Desktop (including translucent windows on 2k/XP), only the Active Window, only the Primary Monitor, and/or Still Video Frames from a Video-For-Windows compliant webcam or other capture device (such as TV card) 
  * Optional preview window allows you to view a video source while still allowing SCWebCam to capture frames from it 
  * Configurable bandwidth throttling on FTP upload 
  * Ability to run in local mode without FTP upload step 
  * Ability to automatically rotate a number of uploads on FTP server 
  * Built-in WWW server - serve your desktop or even a small web page right from your own PC! 
  * Full scripting system allows complete flexibility over the image processing and upload steps. Several sample scripts are provided for those not interested in writing their own. 
  * System/Error Log capability produces a log of your computer settings in case you need to email for help - the author wonA't need to ask so many questions! 
  * Context-Sensitive Help available - just press A'F1A' for a description of the current form 
  * Automatic Installer puts everything in the right folders and prepares the program for first run! 
  * Password lockout feature allows you to lock the configuration for monitoring purposes!
