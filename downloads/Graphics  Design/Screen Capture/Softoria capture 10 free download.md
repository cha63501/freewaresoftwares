**Publisher's Description**  
  

Softoria Capture is a quick-and-easy screen capture utility for Windows, which
allows you to capture the entire screen, at any color depth and resolution. If
you are interested in only capturing one window, you can select to capture the
active window only, to save time editing screenshots.

Also, with the programs here, you can grab all or just a selected area of the
screen or highlight windows objects. These programs also let you save to a
preset folder in standard file formats (BMP, JPEG), preview captured screens,
and customize hotkeys.

Capture runs on the Windows Tray (the lower right corner), and takes a screen
capture every time you left click on the picture of a camera, and a bitmap
will be saved into the directory Capture is running from. You can take as many
captures as you want, limited only by your imagination, and harddrive space.

To exit Capture, just right click on it, and select A'ExitA'; itA's just that
simple.
