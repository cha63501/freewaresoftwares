**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free software to capture high-quality, resizable thumbnails of web pages. This
free software package can be used by anyone wishing to create a gallery of web
pages or a sitemap containing previews of the pages on a website.

The software is intuitive and very easy to use. Use the integrated web browser
to navigate to web pages, wait for the page to load, press the Capture button
and save a high-quality thumbnail of the HTML page. If the size of the
captured image doesn't suit the software allows you to resize the image then
perform the image capture again. All captured images are saved as JPEGs ready
for upload to a website.

Web Page Thumnails also includes a tab showing a gallery of the captured
images presented in a HTML preview file. The gallery provides various options
such as saving thumbnails with different filenames, setting thumbnails as the
desktop background and emailing the thumbnails.
