**Publisher's Description**  
  

AviScreen is an application for capturing screen activity in the form of AVI
video or bitmap images. Beside the usual options defining the capture area,
AviScreen has a unique feature called "follow the cursor". Using this mode you
can produce a video or image of relatively small dimensions while covering all
mouse activity over the whole screen area.
