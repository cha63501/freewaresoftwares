**Publisher's Description**  
  


Manage, view and use the TrueType fonts you need. 

Fonts++ was created to simplify fonts usage by allowing you to switch between two groups ("All TrueType Fonts" & "My Favorite Fonts"). You can determine which TrueType fonts are included (in addition to the core OS & web safe fonts) in the "My Favorite Fonts" groups.

**Features:**

  * Activate/Deactivate individual TrueType fonts using a Popup Menu. 
  * Easily (and quickly) Add/Remove Favorite TrueType fonts (Same popup menu)...can something be easy and NOT quick? 
  * One-click group switching (from the system-tray popup menu). 
  * Preview (via Character Map) w/keystroke info & copy-to-clipboard tool (WingDings anyone?...). 
  * Auto-Activate group on startup. 
  * Auto-Activate group on WindowA's shutdown. 
  * Keeps Core OS & Web safe TrueType fonts active (no strange side effects if you accidently deactivate the wrong TrueType font...(I did this..when coding up Fonts++..very bad, couldnA't read anything on the screen...had to reinstall a fresh image....). 
  * Small footprint, can auto load on Windows Startup. 
  * and more...
