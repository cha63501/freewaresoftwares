**Publisher's Description**  
  


Movelock is an little open source application that uses your webcam to automatically lock your computer when you move away from your desk. 

Leave it running in the background and it will monitor the image produced by your webcam and look for changes between frames. Small changes such as you moving your head around a bit wonA't trigger it, but if you get up and walk away it will pop up a window giving you 5 seconds to stop it locking the system by hitting ESC or clicking the cancel button. If you donA't stop it your system will automatically lock and you will need to enter your password to unlock the system.

Full Delphi source code is provided. Credits: it uses the JLC video component by Juan Luis Ceada Ramos.
