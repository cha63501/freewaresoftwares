**Publisher's Description**  
  


Enigma Crypter is a text crypter and decrypter which uses ENIGMA cipher from the second world war. Factually it is basic version of ENIGMA which was used by units of Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe at the beginning of war. The program uses the same inner mechanism to be compatible with original ENIGMA (it is possible to decrypt german messages from beginning of war). Compatibility isnA't guaranteed for later versions of ENIGMA with more scramblers and different inner connections, and also for marine version of ENIGMA which was used by units of Kriegsmarine.
