Provides real-time intruder alerts and logging features right from your desktop. Compatible with WEP/WPA security. Blocks freeloaders from using your WIFI for internet access. 

**Installation Notes:**

Please [check that your network is configured properly](http://www.mywifizone.com/config.asp) for myWIFIzone to work before installing.

A black (MS-DOS) window will appear for up to five minutes during the installation process as the driver is installed. Please do NOT close this window! (It will close itself).

If you are installing on Windows 2000 machines without Service Pack 2 or above the installation wizard may ask for the file "myWIFIzone.sys" (this file can be found in the installation/Driver folder).

If the driver fails to install, you may need to [install the driver manually](http://www.mywifizone.com/installdriver.htm). When the installation has been completed, you will be asked to reboot your computer. After reboot, you can run myWIFIzone from the Start button.
