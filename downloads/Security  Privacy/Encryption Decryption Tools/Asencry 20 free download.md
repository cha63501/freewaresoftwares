**Publisher's Description**  
  

ASEncry stands for "absolutely secure encryption" and uses one time pad
encryption. If properly used, a one time pad can not be broken. Claude Shannon
proved that the one-time pad ciphers are unbreakable. The program supports the
most common types of one time pad (OTP).

Use Ascencry to encrypt text to and from applications by using simple cut and
paste. Example of use is encrypting mail and text documents where you have to
be 100% sure the cipher can not be decrypted.

There are some very important security issues and principles you must
understand before you start using OTP (One Time Pad).
