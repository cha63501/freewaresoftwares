**Publisher's Description**  
  

SC-PassUnleash allows you to read any of your passwords that are covered by
the asterisks by simply dragging a cursor over such a password field.

Most applications under Windows allow you to store their passwords. Examples
are the passwords of ISPA's, the password of your email client or FTP tool.
Once the password is stored, it is hidden under a row of "***" asterisks and
cannot be read again.

Once the cursor is on top of a "***" password field, SC-PassUnleash instantly
displays the password in readable text on screen.
