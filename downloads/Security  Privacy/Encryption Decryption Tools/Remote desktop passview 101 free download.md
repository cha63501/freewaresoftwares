Remote Desktop PassView is a small application that will reveal the password
stored by Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection utility inside the .rdp files.

Remote Desktop PassView doesnA't require any installation process or
additional DLL files. Just copy the executable (rdpv.exe) to any folder you
like, and run it. After you run rdpv.exe, the main window display the
passwords of .rdp located under your "My Documents" folder. The default .rdp
file (Default.rdp) is usually stored in this location.

If you want to recover that password of another .rdp file, just drag the file
from Explorer into the window of Remote Desktop PassView utility or use the
"Open .rdp File" option from the File menu. Be aware that Remote Desktop
PassView can only recover the passwords created by your current logged on
user. It cannot recover the passwords of .rdp files created by other users.
