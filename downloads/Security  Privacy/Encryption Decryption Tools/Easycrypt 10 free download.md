EasyCrypt is an easy interface for securely encrypting files. EasyCrypt has
the ability for the user to create their own encryption key file which can
then be kept secure or sent out to other people who may need to decrypt files.
Once the user has created this key file they can use it to encrypt and decrypt
files with just a few clicks of the mouse.

Also provided is a secure file deletion screen, which will allow the user to
securely delete a file in the knowledge that it wonA't ever be retrieved by
anyone. EasyCrypt can run on Windows Startup and is then always available from
the System Tray.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
