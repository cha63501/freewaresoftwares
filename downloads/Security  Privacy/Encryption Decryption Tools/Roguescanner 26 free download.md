**Publisher's Description**  
  

RogueScanner is an open-source vulnerability management tool that is used to
gain greater network visibility to enable you to quickly identify and remove
rogue wireless devices that may provide a back door to access your critical
data and infrastructure. Considering that rogue access points and peers
represent a major threat to data integrity, RogueScanner is a valuable tool
that you can start using today at no cost.

More than 300 companies manufacture access points, and there are more than
10,000 different models of network infrastructure. Companies thus face a major
challenge in maintaining a system to track and identify all potential rogue
wireless devices and in continually scanning the network to identify them. To
address this challenge, Network Chemistry has made an open-source product
available to help organizations begin to immediately scan their networks.
RogueScannerA is available for use at no charge by organizations looking for a
tool focused on device identification and rogue detection. RogueScanner
leverages the Collaborative Device Classification system to automatically
lookup and identify the device type and its identity in real time.

**Features:**

  * Free, network-based vulnerability management tool 
  * Detects rogue wireless devices 
  * Automated identification in real time
