**Publisher's Description**  
  


Mandiant First Response is a free software solution for incident responders that provides an efficient toolkit for collecting and analyzing critical data following a suspected computer security event. 

Mandiant First Response provides the ability to remotely collect the volatile data that allows organizations to perform precision strike responses when an incident occurs. Information from file listings, system registries, running processes and services, event logs, and many other data sources can now be centrally gathered and rapidly reviewed to validate a computer security event. 

The software is comprised of a deployable Agent that gathers relevant forensic data from target systems, and a centralized Console for command, control, and analysis functions. Data acquisitions can be performed locally or via a network connection, providing investigators with the necessary flexibility to conduct forensic operations in a variety of environments.

Verison 1.1 adds SSL stream encryption and authentication support for connections between the Console and Agent, credential storage on the Console for connections to password-protected Agents, improved Console memory management, direct printing support, improved Agent support for Win2K, and a host of UI and performance improvements. 

Mandiant First Response 1.1 includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit, as well as cryptographic software written by Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com) and Tim Hudson (tjh@cryptsoft.com). 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
