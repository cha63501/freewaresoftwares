**Publisher's Description**  
  

DataGuarder is a small application which will reset access permissions on all
defined folders to allow only the users defined in the application to have
access to them. It will then monitor the folders for any changes to the
security settings on the folders and when a change occurs it will reset the
access ACLA's to the settings defined and thus block any attempts at changing
them to gain access.
