**Publisher's Description**  
  


When a file is deleted, it is not completely removed from the hard disk. So, it is actually possible for somebody to recover these files using file recovery programs. This is a threat if you have some sensitive data that you wish to remove. Shredder is a freeware program using which you can simply select files and shred them. With a very easy-to-use interface, just select the files, and click on shred. The files once shred, even if recovered will not show the original contents. The main advantage of this program is: ItA's just 9 kb in size (ThatA's right... 9 kb), and no messy forms, just one simple dialog. Attractive Matrix type Green interface. 

**Bug Fixes And New Features:**

  * Duplicate entries removal works 
  * Duplicate entries get removed automatically during shred or erase 
  * Sequences of 0s and 1s get filled in, before use of standard Nikhil BaligaA's Shredder algorithm (that was used before) 
  * Refresh feature has been added 
  * Speed has been increased 
  * Missing path error fixed
