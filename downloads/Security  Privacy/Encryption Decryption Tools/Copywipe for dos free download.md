**Publisher's Description**  
  

CopyWipe is a utility for copying or securely overwriting (wiping/erasing)
entire hard drives. CopyWipe can ease and expedite the transition to a new
hard drive by copying the entire contents of one drive to another. CopyWipe
can also help prevent confidential or private data from being recovered, by
securely wiping the contents of a drive. A number of options are provided for
wiping, most of which exceed governmental standards (such as DoD 5220.22-M,
NAVSO P-5239-26, etc.); this allows the user to choose an optimal balance
between security and duration of the wiping operation.

Also available is [CopyWipe for
Windows](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_9_95_20762.html) (also
freeware).
