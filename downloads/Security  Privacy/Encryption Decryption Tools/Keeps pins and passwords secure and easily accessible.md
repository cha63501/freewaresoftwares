**Publisher's Description**  
  


Many people store valuable information on their PDAs without knowing that the built-in security of most PDAs is easy to break. 

Cryptomathic Secure Memorizer for PALM is a small application developed by Cryptomathic for storing e.g. PIN codes and passwords on the PALM Organiser in a secure and easily accessible way. The replacement algorithm for DES, AES, is used for the encryption which enhances the security of the application.

In order to enter the safe area of the application where your passwords and codes are stored, you need a key. This key is a sequence, at your choice, of 4-16 nodes and major faces of our logo (the small faces in the star of the Cryptomathic logo can not be selected).

This key is used to AES encrypt the contents of the edit area (i.e. the safe area).

If requested, the key can be changed later, as can its length. Possible lengths are from 4 to 16.

If the key is forgotten, it is possible to reset the application but in this case, the data is of course lost.

Whenever the program is closed, the contents of the safe area are encrypted. The encrypted data will be backed up during Hot Sync operations.
