**Publisher's Description**  
  


FileSecure is a little app that will help you keep your private files private by encrypting them. When you encrypt the file, you enter a password and the file can only be decrypted when the correct password is entered. There is also an option that does not prompt you for a password when encrypting the file. 

You can also drag and drop files on to the window to encrypt/decrypt them. FileSecure 1.0 can handle multiple files at one time, but not a folder.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx).
