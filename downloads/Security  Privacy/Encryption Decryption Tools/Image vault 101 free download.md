**Publisher's Description**  
  

Image Vault is the ideal and easy to use solution to keeping your images and
pictures private and away from the prying eyes of children, parents, partners
and employers etc. With Image Vault you can create a vault file into which you
can encrypt, store, manage and view any image file and keep them password
protected and secret from the eyes of others.

Unlike other software of this nature, including WinRar and WinZip, Image Vault
does not need to export a file into your computerA's temporary directory for
it to be viewed. Instead, everything is handled inside Image Vault, leaving no
trace what-so-ever on your computer as to what has been viewed.

Uniquely, Image Vault does not need any special installation on your computer.
It doesnA't require any third-party software like MicrosoftA's .net framework
either. Indeed, something I recommend for extra security, Image Vault can be
installed or copied onto a flash-drive/data stick and run from there. Image
Vault is 100% portable.

Ensuring that your vault files remain unhackable, Image Vault employs military
grade, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms.
