**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you have configured your BitLocker Drive Encryption to back up recovery
information for BitLocker-protected drives and the Trusted Platform Module
(TPM) to Active Directory in your environment you have most likely also
installed the Bitlocker Recovery Password Viewer for Active Directory so that
you can view the recovery password for selected computer objects. If this is
the case, you may also have asked your self the following questions:

  * IAve just implemented Bitlocker, but how do I know that the recovery passwords are being populating for all of my computers? 
  * How can I identify machines that have problems with the Bitlocker process? 
  * How can I identify which machines do NOT have a recovery password? 
You could answer these questions by opening the properties for each of your
computer objects and locating the Bitlocker Password Recovery tab. But, as you
can imagine this is a very tedious project for a domain with hundreds or even
thousands of computers. This is where the AD Bitlocker Password Audit tool
comes in.  
  
The AD Bitlocker Password Audit is a free Windows tool for querying your
Active Directory for all or selected computer objects and returning their
recovery password in a grid-view format giving you a quick overview of the
status of your current password recovery capabilities. With the included data
filtering functionality you can quickly create detailed results for machines
that match your filtering criteria.
