**Publisher's Description**  
  

Protect Me! 2010 creates secure executable (.exe) container files to which you
can add any files and directories you want to! Your files will be stored
securely inside the container file.

To ensure a maximum of security, Protect Me! 2010 uses SHA1 for password
validation and AES for encryption. The container file can either run or
extract your files once you typed in the right password.

**Features:**

  * Easily password-protect any file you want! 
  * You get one .exe file which contains the encrypted file(s) 
    * The result will be just a few KB bigger than the encrypted files themselves! 
  * Your data is really secure! 
    * SHA1 for password validation 
    * AES (Rijndael) for your data 
  * The container file is compiled at runtime! 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).

**What's New in version 1.0.1.1:**

  * Bugfix: Executing multiple files threw an exception (reported by Anonymous) 
  * Bugfix: Buttons "Extract Everything" and "Save As" were mixed up 
  * Bugfix: Fixed some smaller issues
