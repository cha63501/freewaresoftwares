TRACE! is a free document security tool that provides information privacy and security. TRACE! analyzes Microsoft Office documents and alerts you if the document contains information on previous authors and edits, hidden track changes, comments and speaker notes, server paths and email addresses, intellectual property, financial information, profanity, regulatory information, and over 20 other hidden information elements. An A'Always-OnA' document security risk rating alerts you to the presence of dangerous data in all the documents you touch.
