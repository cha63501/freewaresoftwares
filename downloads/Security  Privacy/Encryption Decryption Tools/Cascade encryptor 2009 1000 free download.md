**Publisher's Description**  
  

Cascade Encryptor is multiple cascade encryption program for file by random
selected algorithms.

**Purpose:** Safekeeping for backup data.

**Features:**

  * Output "cipher file" and "key file".  

  * Minimize encryption information in "cipher file".  

  * Not use password.  

**Algorithms:**

  * aes-256-ctr  

  * blowfish-448-ctr  

  * camellia-256-ctr  

  * cast256-256-ctr  

  * serpent-256-ctr  

  * shacal2-512-ctr  

  * sosemanuk-256  

  * twofish-256-ctr  

  * xsalsa20-256  

  

**To secure backup files for a long time ...**

  1. "Cascade Encryptor" does cascade encryption with multiple different algorithms.   

    * Three encryption algorithms are selected at random.   

    * All Encryption key is different.   

    * Even if some of the encryption algorithms would be broken, cipher files are still secure.   

  2. "Cascade Encryptor" minimize information in cipher files.   

    * From cipher file, anyone cannot find which encryption algorithms were used.   

    * Encryption keys are not contained in encryption file.   

    * IV(Initialization vector) are not contained in encryption file.   

  3. "Cascade Encryptor" maximize effective bit length of encryption keys.   

    * "Password-Based Key Derivation" does not be used.   

    * Maximum encryption key length is used.   

  4. "Cascade Encryptor" does several things.   

    * By using "second_key.txt", decryptable person is limited.   

    * Encryption keys are not reused.
