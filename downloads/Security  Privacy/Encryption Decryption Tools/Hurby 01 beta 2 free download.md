**Publisher's Description**  
  

Hurby is a small open-source project for establishing a system to remove every
kind of unwanted data from you system.

For example, many programs store information about the files you work with,
some of them store this information in ini-files, some of them use the windows
registry. As there is no unified way how such information is stored, there are
hundreds of programs out there for cleaning this information.

Hurby is used for this, so it is more flexible than any other program.
Currently the program comes with 5 plugins for Irfan-View, Total-Commander,
Winamp, Virtual-Dub and the windows recent-documents folder.
