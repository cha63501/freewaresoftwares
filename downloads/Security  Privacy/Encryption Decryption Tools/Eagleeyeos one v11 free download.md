**Publisher's Description**  
  

Using EagleEyeOS One and One Plus, the user can determine access rights to the
generally used communication channels, e.g. Floppy, CD, DVD, InfraRed, COM,
LPT, USB, Bluetooth, Wireless, etc.

The most significant feature is that different devices and storages can be
handled irrespectively of their momentary availability. E.g., Bluetooth
communication on a certain host can be blocked even if the host is not
connected to a Bluetooth device at that moment. The Bluetooth device connected
later on will not function on the host.

The user can assign access rights to portable devices, which are detected by
the operating system as file systems and-or drives, e.g. Pen-Drive, camera or
the mobile phone memory. It controls the connected storages in runtime,
therefore it handles devices independently of producers and types.

A major feature is that events made onto storages are logged; and a Read- Only
rule can be used too. If a device gets disconnected after shutdown of the
computer, the computer will store alerts and send them to specified e-mail
addresses at the next startup. It enables the setting of extended protection
functions, the property panel can be password protected, running and stopping
of the program can be disabled, the automatic starting can be enabled. In
silent mode the user cannot see the program. EagleEyeOS One will send alerts
via e-mail about newly connected or disconnected devices, as well as file
operations upon disconnect. The extended functions are available in One Plus
only. It controls the processes at the kernel level, so it is independent of
the applications running at the user levels.

WARNING! The license and user rights for the use of the extended features of
One Plus are only valid for a single - one time - installation and activation.
In case of hardware failure, or re-installation of your computer, a new
license is required. Please, create a security backup of the program, as well
as the computer hard drive after the activation.
