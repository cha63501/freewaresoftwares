DF Encryption Pad is a simple (and free) application that lets you encrypt and
decrypt rich text messages using cut and paste. DF Encryption Pad uses 256-bit
AES encryption with a key that it generates from the A'Pass PhraseA' you
supply. It can open and save both text files (.txt) and rich-text files
(.rtf).

DF Encryption Pad is great for keeping confidential notes, and for encrypting
email or short instant messages.
