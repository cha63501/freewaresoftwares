**Publisher's Description**  
  


CyberShredder is a quick, safe and handy utility that lets you erase confidential files from your computer permanently. Normal file deletion will remove a fileA's directory entry and allocation table information. The actual disk clusters that contained the fileA's data remains intact on your hard disk and can be recovered later. CyberShredder overwrites the space occupied from a file with random data and erases the file, so an unerase utility will never be able to recover it. 

CyberShredderA's simple interface will help you get rid of confidential data permanently. It has three different methods of deleting files including the NSA approved seven-pass file deletion method.

Please note that files and directories erased by CyberShredder can not be recovered using an undelete program. Make sure you use it with care. We recommend that you learn how to use the program by testing its behaviour with some test data first.
