**Publisher's Description**  
  

TRACE! is a free document security tool that provides information privacy and
security. TRACE! analyzes Microsoft Office documents and alerts you if the
document contains information on previous authors and edits, hidden track
changes, comments and speaker notes, server paths and email addresses,
intellectual property, financial information, profanity, regulatory
information, and over 20 other hidden information elements. An A'Always-OnA'
document security risk rating alerts you to the presence of dangerous data in
all the documents you touch. Run TRACE! against any Microsoft Office document
on your computer, company network, or external website.
