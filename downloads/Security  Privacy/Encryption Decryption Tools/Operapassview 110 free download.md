**Publisher's Description**  
  

OperaPassView is a small password recovery tool that decrypts the content of
the Opera Web browser password file (wand.dat) and displays the list of all
Web site passwords stored in this file. You can easily select one or more
passwords in the OperaPassView window, and then copy the passwords list to the
clipboard and save it into text/html/csv/xml file.

**System Requirements**

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and
up to Windows 7/2008. You can use this utility even if Opera Web browser is
not installed on your system, as long as you have the wand.dat filename.

**WhatA's New in version 1.10:**

  * Fixed to detect properly the passwords of login.live.com and probably other Web sites. 
  * Added /RawExport command-line option to export Opera wand file into a raw text file (without detecting which fields are the user names and passwords). This option is useful when OperaPassView fails to detect the user name / password field properly and displays other fields instead. 
  * Added /LoadWand command-line option to specify the desired wand file to load.
