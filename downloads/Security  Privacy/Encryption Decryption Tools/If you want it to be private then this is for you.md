**Publisher's Description**  
  


Clip2Crypt, unlike most tools of this type, does not need to be accessed once set up and it can be used with almost any text based application. 

Clip2Crypt uses the clipboard as a transfer medium and is operated by using global hotkeys to force copy and paste operations. Text is automatically encrypted or decrypted. 

It can manipulate both RichText Format (RTF) and Unicode/Plain Text making it ideal for use in email or any message sending program. It can be used with any text based application able to handle either format and can access clipboard. Use it anywhere you want to keep your messages private, on-line or off. Create private messages in public places. Use Clip2Crypt to keep your email, chat, notes, documents and your messages private. Simply press the relevant hotkeys and your message is encrypted. Do the same to decrypt it. It doesnA't get any easier! 

Clip2Crypt can handle all or part of a page of text. This allows the addition of an encrypted section in a message, eg a digital signature that can be decrypted and checked by the receiver.

It can also be used to copy text to your selected editor without encryption/decryption, making a useful extension to normal clipboard use.

It is fully portable and will work from USB memory able to be written to.

It does not interfere with the normal usage of clipboard except that it will of course replace anything already on the clipboard. 

It uses the Rijndael/AES-256 cryptograhic cipher. This is a cipher that has been analyzed extensively and is used worldwide.
