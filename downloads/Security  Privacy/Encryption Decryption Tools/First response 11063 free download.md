**Publisher's Description**  
  

Mandiant First Response is a free software solution for incident responders
that provides an efficient toolkit for collecting and analyzing critical data
following a suspected computer security event.

Mandiant First Response provides the ability to remotely collect the volatile
data that allows organizations to perform precision strike responses when an
incident occurs. Information from file listings, system registries, running
processes and services, event logs, and many other data sources can now be
centrally gathered and rapidly reviewed to validate a computer security event.

The software is comprised of a deployable Agent that gathers relevant forensic
data from target systems, and a centralized Console for command, control, and
analysis functions. Data acquisitions can be performed locally or via a
network connection, providing investigators with the necessary flexibility to
conduct forensic operations in a variety of environments.

Verison 1.1 adds SSL stream encryption and authentication support for
connections between the Console and Agent, credential storage on the Console
for connections to password-protected Agents, improved Console memory
management, direct printing support, improved Agent support for Win2K, and a
host of UI and performance improvements.

Mandiant First Response 1.1 includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit, as well as cryptographic software written by
Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com) and Tim Hudson (tjh@cryptsoft.com).

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or
above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
