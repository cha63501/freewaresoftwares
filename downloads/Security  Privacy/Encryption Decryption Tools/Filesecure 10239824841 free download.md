**Publisher's Description**  
  

FileSecure is a little app that will help you keep your private files private
by encrypting them. When you encrypt the file, you enter a password and the
file can only be decrypted when the correct password is entered. There is also
an option that does not prompt you for a password when encrypting the file.

You can also drag and drop files on to the window to encrypt/decrypt them.
FileSecure 1.0 can handle multiple files at one time, but not a folder.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
1.1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx).
