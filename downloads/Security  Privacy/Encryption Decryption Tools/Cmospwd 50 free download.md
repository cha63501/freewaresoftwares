**Publisher's Description**  
  

CmosPwd is a cmos/bios password recovery application. CmosPwd works and
compiles under Dos-Win9x, Windows NT/W2K/XP/2003, Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.

**Typical Usage for DOS and all Windows users:**

  1. Identify your BIOS manufacturer (usually displayed at boot-up) 
  2. Start in DOS, or start a DOS session in Windows 95/98/ME. For Windows NT or Windows 2000 boot from a DOS or Windows 95/98 boot disk (you can find boot disks at www.AnswersThatWork.com), and run CMOSPWD from your boot floppy (or another floppy). 
  3. C: [Enter] cd CMOSPWD [Enter] 
  4. Type CMOSPWD at the DOS prompt and press Enter. 
  5. CMOSPWD will display a list of possibilities. Use the possibilities itemised against your BIOS manufacturer. Remember : 
    * For AWARD BIOSes, use the Numeric Keypad (with NumLock ON). 
    * AWARD 4.50PG BIOS always accepts "AWARD_SW", or "d8on", or "589589". 
    * Old Phoenix BIOSes will accept "phoenix". 
  6. If the standard method does not work, then try to kill the CMOS password with CMOSPWD /K (and press Enter), and then see if you can get into the CMOS without a password. If you can, you successfully "killed" the old CMOS password. **DO NOT KILL THE CMOS ON LAPTOPS!**
On laptops, the password is usually stored in an eeprom on the motherboard,
you need an eeprom programmer (electronic device) to retrieve it.
