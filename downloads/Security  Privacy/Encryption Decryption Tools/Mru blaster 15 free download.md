**Publisher's Description**  
  

MRU-Blaster is an application made to do one large task - detect and clean
most recently used lists on your computer.

These MRU lists contain information such as the names and/or locations of the
last files you have accessed. They are located ALL OVER your registry, and for
almost ANY file type.

By looking at these MRU lists, someone could determine what files you
opened/saved/looked at, what their file names were, and much more! (And, in
many cases, the lists are displayed in drop-down menus automatically.)

With additional plug-ins that allow you to clean out your Temporary Internet
Files and Cookies, MRU-Blaster enhances the protection of your privacy!
