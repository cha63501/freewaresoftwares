**Publisher's Description**  
  

Empathy is a small, simple, easy-to-use but smart and reliable utility
allowing you to password-protect any executable file.

Empathy can modify an EXE file so that it will require a password to run. Only
a person knowing the password will be allowed to run the protected program.
Protected files stay protected if you copy them to another location or even to
another computer, no matter which operating system do they use.

Empathy allows you to protect potentially dangerous programs against running
by an unauthorized person. You can use it to protect executable files in
public places like schools, internet coffees or even homes.
