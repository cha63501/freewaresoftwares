**Publisher's Description**  
  

Want to save a copy of your personal file on a usb pendrive but you are
worried that, in case of theft, someone will be able to access your data?

With Free File Camouflage you can hide your files inside a jpeg image!

The software can be used with the main interface or via the explorer "send to"
context menu (the first time you only need to select a directory with some
images).

All the files are encrypted using AES and hidden inside an image.

What happens if someone tries to open a camouflaged image? Well... nothing! He
will only see the image.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The program offers 3rd party software which does not have to be installed to use the software.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
