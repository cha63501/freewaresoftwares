**Publisher's Description**  
  

gpg4usb is a very easy to use portable-application, which combines a simple
text-editor with a GnuPG-frontend to write, encrypt and decrypt your text-
messages.

Almost the only thing required is an available usb-port you are allowed to
access. With this application you can write safe and encrypted messages
anywhere you are: should it be an internet-cafe, at work or somewhere else on
holiday... and you always have the encryption-keys available for usage!

The usage of gpg4usb should be highly self-describing, since the user-
interface and all the options it offers are clear cut: Simply execute the
binary on your usb-pendrive and start typing e.g. the Mailtext you want to be
encrypted. If youA're done, choose the right gpg/pgp-key for the person you
are writing to and hit the encrypt-icon at the top of the application-window.
The resulting encrypted text you can save as a text-file to send it as mail-
attachment, or copy it directly into your mail-user-agent or webmail-website.
To make sure, you can read this message by yourself afterwards, encrypt it for
the recipient and to yourself at the same time - if you want, you can mark as
much keys as you want to encrypt for.

You want to add a gpg/pgp-key to your mobile keyring? NothingA's easier than
that: just hit the crypto-menue-entry and choose Import Key from File or
Import Key from Editor. This means that itA's possible to import an ascii-
armored pubkey via file-dialog, or via copy&paste into your editor-window. If
you find a key e.g. on a website, just copy it, paste it into the gpg4usb-
editor and hit Import Key from Editor - thatA's it, and the key shows up on
your keyring!
