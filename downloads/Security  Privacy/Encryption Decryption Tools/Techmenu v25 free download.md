**Publisher's Description**  
  

TechMenu is an application used to limit a users access to programs designated
by an administrator. Programs such as these are also know as Menus or
Launchers. The difference between TechMenu and other launcher/menus is that
TechMenu will not run anything except those applications chosen by the
administrator. This prevents users from playing games and searching the web
while they should be working. TechMenu does this by allowing you to create a
non-moveable, full screen menu with easy access buttons, launching ONLY the
programs that are deemed allowable by the administrator.
