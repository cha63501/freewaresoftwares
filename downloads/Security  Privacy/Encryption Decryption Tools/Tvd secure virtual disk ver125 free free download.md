It is the on-the-fly encryption software capable of encrypting a virtual drive
partition up to theoretically 16,000,000GB. You can extract and encrypt CD-Rom
image files as well. The encryption scheme is pretty robust and supports
AES128/192/256 and TwoFish 160 Bit Key.

Furthermore, you can use the DSA asymmetric encryption key algorithm so that
you can take advantage of digital signatures. Using the public key encryption

you have encrypted and encrypt messages that only you can decrypt.Also
hardware keys are supported. You can turn any media drives as a hardware key.
