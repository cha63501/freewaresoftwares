**Publisher's Description**  
  


SC-PassUnleash allows you to read any of your passwords that are covered by the asterisks by simply dragging a cursor over such a password field. 

Most applications under Windows allow you to store their passwords. Examples are the passwords of ISPA's, the password of your email client or FTP tool. Once the password is stored, it is hidden under a row of "***" asterisks and cannot be read again.

Once the cursor is on top of a "***" password field, SC-PassUnleash instantly displays the password in readable text on screen.
