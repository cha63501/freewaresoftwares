**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Vault is a file encryption program that automatically organizes files by
extension and version. It will keep multiple versions of files added to its
repository and maintain their original modification, creation and access
times. The Vault offers the following security layers...

  1. PIN protection on the application. 
  2. Encryption on configuration files. 
  3. Hardware profiling on configuration files so they can only be accessed on the computer that created them. 
  4. User profiling on configuration files so they can only be accessed by the user that created them. 
  5. The ability to alter the encoding algorithm with a WebPass Pro file. Essentially using it a unique encryption key. For more information about WebPass Pro please visit www.jbcg.net. 
  6. Profile stamping of encrypted files so they can only be decoded by the same computer/username that encoded them. This extra layer of protection is included in case someone breaks the hardware and user profile layers. 
  7. Automatically compresses all files before encoding them 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
1.1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx).
