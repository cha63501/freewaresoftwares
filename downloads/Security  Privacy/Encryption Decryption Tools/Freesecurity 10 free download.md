**Publisher's Description**  
  

FreeSecurity is an easy to use freeware application that allows you to use
encryption to secure your files and safeguard your privacy. FreeSecurity uses
strong 128-bit AES encryption (also known as Rijndael), the next generation US
Goverment standard for protection of classified information (according to the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, it would take about 149
trillion years to break an AES key using usual methods) which offers a great
level of protection to your files. Additionally, it offers file compression on
the encrypted files.
