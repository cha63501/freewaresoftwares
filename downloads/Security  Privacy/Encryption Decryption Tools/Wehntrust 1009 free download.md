**Publisher's Description**  
  

WehnTrust is a Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) that provides
secure buffer overflow exploitation countermeasures.

WehnTrust implements Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for Windows.
While ASLR is a common security measure for UNIX-based operating systems
thanks to the PaX Team, it has not been widely implemented for, or deployed
on, Windows. When implemented properly, ASLR mitigates nearly all exploitation
techniques. The commercial version of WehnTrust also provides other security
mechanisms that help to augment ASLR.

**Features:**

  * Randomized Image Files (DLLs, EXEs with relocations) 
  * Randomized Memory Allocations (Stack, Heap, etc) 
  * Randomized PEB/TEB 
  * Application and Image File Randomization Exemptions
