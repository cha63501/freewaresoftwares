**Publisher's Description**  
  

Clip2Crypt, unlike most tools of this type, does not need to be accessed once
set up and it can be used with almost any text based application.

Clip2Crypt uses the clipboard as a transfer medium and is operated by using
global hotkeys to force copy and paste operations. Text is automatically
encrypted or decrypted.

It can manipulate both RichText Format (RTF) and Unicode/Plain Text making it
ideal for use in email or any message sending program. It can be used with any
text based application able to handle either format and can access clipboard.
Use it anywhere you want to keep your messages private, on-line or off. Create
private messages in public places. Use Clip2Crypt to keep your email, chat,
notes, documents and your messages private. Simply press the relevant hotkeys
and your message is encrypted. Do the same to decrypt it. It doesnA't get any
easier!

Clip2Crypt can handle all or part of a page of text. This allows the addition
of an encrypted section in a message, eg a digital signature that can be
decrypted and checked by the receiver.

It can also be used to copy text to your selected editor without
encryption/decryption, making a useful extension to normal clipboard use.

It is fully portable and will work from USB memory able to be written to.

It does not interfere with the normal usage of clipboard except that it will
of course replace anything already on the clipboard.

It uses the Rijndael/AES-256 cryptograhic cipher. This is a cipher that has
been analyzed extensively and is used worldwide.
