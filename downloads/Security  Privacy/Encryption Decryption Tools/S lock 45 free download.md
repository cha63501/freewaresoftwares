**Publisher's Description**  
  

S Lock is designed as a security feature for those of you wanting to prevent
unauthorised users from using your computer. It also disables CTRL+ALT+DEL,
ALT+TAB, CTRL+ESC, along with the most commonly used key combinations.

This stops a user completely from stopping the program unless they have the
passcode. (PLEASE NOTE: The key combinations are enabled again once the key
has been entered correctly and the program is unloaded).
