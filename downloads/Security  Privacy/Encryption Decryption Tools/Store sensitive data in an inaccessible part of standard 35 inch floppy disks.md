**Publisher's Description**  
  


Private Floppy is a special tool allowing you to store sensitive data in an inaccessible part of standard 3.5 inch floppy disks. Stored data can not be seen in Windows Explorer or any other standard file manager. Private Floppy uses floppy disksA' boot sector to store data. It is specially designed for storing E-mails, Phone numbers, Passwords and other important data. 

In the time of CDs, DVDs and USB storage devices, Private Floppy is a bit obsolete (I myself used it last time in 2004 - now I donAt even have a floppy drive) but the source code still can be used as a demonstration of low level disk access.

The Delphi source code of Private Floppy is a part of itAs distribution package. The program is released under the terms of the MIT license.
