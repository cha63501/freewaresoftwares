**Publisher's Description**  
  


DataGuarder is a small application which will reset access permissions on all defined folders to allow only the users defined in the application to have access to them. It will then monitor the folders for any changes to the security settings on the folders and when a change occurs it will reset the access ACLA's to the settings defined and thus block any attempts at changing them to gain access.
