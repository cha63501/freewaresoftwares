**Publisher's Description**  
  

Crypto Composer is a crypto-system based on well published asymmetric public
key and symmetric key crypto-algorithms. It is the first embodiment of our
next generation soft token based declarative cryptographic key, access right
and digital source distribution and management technology. It can be used as a
file/message encryptor/decryptor on local computer and in passing through the
internet.

It allows the public key authentication of the sender of secuured data and
intended list of receivers so that a user can build his/her own dynamic
virtual private network (VPN) over the public internet easily and automate it
using our more advanced products and services. It contains a personal crypto-
gateway server and a (audio) media streaming server that provide modern
cryptographic strength protection of a userA's identity, privacy, (social)
relationship, and rights on the internet.

The declarative, modern cryptographic security system of CryptoGateway allows
fine grain person to person identity, privacy, access control, secured message
exchange, and digital right management that is uncoupled to the hardware and
software environments that they uses.
