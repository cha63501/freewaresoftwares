**Publisher's Description**  
  

T-Code is a fast and economical Encoding-/Decoding-Tool for Microsoft Windows.
It should run on all systems supporting the 32-Bit-architecture (Windows XP
and higher recommended).

The used encryption algorithm can be regarded as secure and suitable for most
of the needs of private and industrial usage. But keep in mind that no
encryption utility can be regarded as absolutely secure!

T-Code is fully portable and consumes very low disk-space (less than 1 MB!).
It does not write any stuff to the registry. So you can run it from your hard
disk and every portable medium (e.g. flash disk, usb-stick). You must have the
permission to read/write the directory.

You can port the T-Code installation to any computer or removable medium by
copying the whole directory with all containing files. Just unzip the
delivered archive file.
