RootMask is a free tool which encodes a file of any extension into another
file of any extension. If you password the encoded file using RootMask then
RootMask will automatically encrypt the input file into the Target file.
Otherwise no encryption is used. Using RootMask personal files such as a
private photo album can be hidden into another file so no one will ever find
it.

Using RootMask you can securely and legally (under the Data Protection Act
(1998)) transfer sensitive or personal file from your workplace back to your
home to work on in your free time. Using RootMask you can Upload an EXE, MP3,
WAV, MPEG, WMV or any other file to an Image Hosting service by binding the
file to an image file like a JPEG for example. There are much more things you
can do using Rootmask.
