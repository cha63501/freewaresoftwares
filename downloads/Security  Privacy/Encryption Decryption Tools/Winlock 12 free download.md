**Publisher's Description**  
  

WinLock is a simple utility, which setting HKLM "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" in register "AutoAdminLogon" to "0" or "1" and
controls automatic logon for user "DefaultUserName" with password which you
with WinLock setup to "DefaultPassword"...

WARNING: WinLock do not setup password for Windows account (net user user_name
password), only set up password, which will be used for automatic logon -
itA's presumed the user have been set up/will set up password himself. With
shortcut on desktop you will lock account by one click (rundll32.exe
user32.dll, LockWorkStation) and disable automatic logon. After logon by click
on "Unlock account pernamently" you will activate automatic logon "without
password".

ItA's important to know, so user password, which is used for automatic logon,
is in register saved UNECRYPTED. WinLock was created as compensation for
screensavers with password. WinLock is not active program running as system
service but only utility which configure logon procedure and until you unlock
account pernamently is account guarded by password even if you restart the
computer. With combination with disable boot from other drives, suppress "safe
mode", "console", Administrator account with password and other ways to
sidetrack standard Windows start, will be WinLock guard ability relativly
strong. :)

After uninstall is password used for automatic logon "DefaultPassword" set up
on blank value automatic logon "AutoAdminLogon" set up on "1" - in case, you
will set up password for account set up on blank value (net user user_name
""), system will be started without requesting password automatically.
