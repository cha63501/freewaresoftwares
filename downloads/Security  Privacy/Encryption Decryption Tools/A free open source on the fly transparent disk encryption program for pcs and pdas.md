**Publisher's Description**  
  


FreeOTFE is a free, open source, "on-the-fly" transparent disk encryption program for PCs and PDAs (Windows Mobile 2003/2005). 

Using this software, you can create one or more "virtual disks" on your PC/PDA - anything written to these disks is transparently, and securely, encrypted before being stored on your computerA's hard drive. 

**Features:**

  * Source code freely available 
  * Easy to use; full wizard included for creating new volumes 
  * Data encrypted on your PC can be read/written on your PDA, and vice versa 
  * Powerful: Supports numerous hash/encryption algorithms, and provides a greater level of flexibility than a number of other (including commercial!) OTFE systems 
  * Hash algorithms include: MD5, SHA-512, RIPEMD-160, Tiger and many more 
  * Cyphers include AES (256 bit), Twofish (256 bit), Blowfish (448 bit), Serpent (256 bit) and many more 
  * "Portable mode" included; FreeOTFE doesnA't need to be installed before it can be used - making it ideal for carrying your data securely on USB drives! 
  * Operates under both PC (MS Windows 2000/XP) and PDA (Windows Mobile 2003/2005) platforms 
  * Linux compatibility (Cryptoloop "losetup", dm-crypt and LUKS supported) 
  * "Hidden" volumes may be concealed within other FreeOTFE volumes, providing "plausible deniability" 
  * FreeOTFE volumes have no "signature" to allow them to be identified as such 
  * Encrypted volumes can be either file or partition based. 
  * Modular design allowing 3rd party drivers to be created, incorporating new hash/cypher algorithms 
  * Decryption software available to improve transparency, and allow even the most junior software engineer to prove data is being encrypted correctly 
  * Supports password salting (up to 512 bits), reducing the risks presented by dictionary attacks. 
  * Allows users to backup and restore the critical areas of volume files. 
  * Keyfile support included; store volumes and their associated metadata separately. 
  * Uses per-sector IVs, including support for ESSIV 
  * Volume file timestamps and attributes are reset after dismounting, increasing "plausible deniability" 
  * Supports volumes files up to 2^63 bytes (8388608 TB) 
  * Naturally, fully supported by SecureTrayUtil.
