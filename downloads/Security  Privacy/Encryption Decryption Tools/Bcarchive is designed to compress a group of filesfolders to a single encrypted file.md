**Publisher's Description**  
  


BCArchive is designed to compress a group of files/folders to a single encrypted file. The following options to encrypt data are implemented: 

  * Create compressed and encrypted archive file protected by password. 
  * Create compressed and encrypted archive file encrypted using the public key of another user. 
  * Add several passwords to an existing archive file. 
  * Apply more than one public keys to an archive file enabling a number of users to decrypt the archive. 
  * Generate new or use existing secret/public key pairs in PKCS-12/X.509 format. 
  * Compress and encrypt data to a self-extracted executable program. The user can run the program and extract the data even on a computer where BCArchive is not installed. 
BCArchive enables the use of existing public key databases, such as those created for PGP software, which have been used world-wide for many years. BCArchive utilizes the following encryption algorithms, standards and specifications: 
  * Symmetric algorithms: Rijndael (AES), Blowfish-256, Blowfish-448, IDEA, CAST5, GOST 28147-89, Triple DES. 
  * Secure Hash Algorithms: SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5 and RIPEMD-160. 
  * Asymmetric (public/secret key pair) algorithms: RSA, ElGamal / Diffie-Hellman. 
  * Specifications for public/secret key pair format: PKCS #12, X.509. 
  * PKCS #5 recommendations for the implementation of password-based cryptography. 
  * RFC 2440 specifications for session keys encrypted by symmetric or public key encryption algorithms. 

**WhatA's New in version 2.05.7:**
