**Publisher's Description**  
  

When a file is deleted, it is not completely removed from the hard disk. So,
it is actually possible for somebody to recover these files using file
recovery programs. This is a threat if you have some sensitive data that you
wish to remove. Shredder is a freeware program using which you can simply
select files and shred them. With a very easy-to-use interface, just select
the files, and click on shred. The files once shred, even if recovered will
not show the original contents. The main advantage of this program is: ItA's
just 9 kb in size (ThatA's right... 9 kb), and no messy forms, just one simple
dialog. Attractive Matrix type Green interface.

**Bug Fixes And New Features:**

  * Duplicate entries removal works 
  * Duplicate entries get removed automatically during shred or erase 
  * Sequences of 0s and 1s get filled in, before use of standard Nikhil BaligaA's Shredder algorithm (that was used before) 
  * Refresh feature has been added 
  * Speed has been increased 
  * Missing path error fixed
