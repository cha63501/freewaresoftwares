**Publisher's Description**  
  

Simple File Shredder is a utility that securely deletes your files so they
canA't be restored using recovery software.

When you delete a file using the conventional Windows delete method, the file
is not actually destroyed. Windows simply acknowledges the file is no longer
needed and considers it free space. The deleted file will exist in a
recoverable state until itA's over-written with other data.

When you use Simple File Shredder to shred a file, the file is over-written
with with random bytes before itA's deleted. If the file was ever restored
using recovery software, it would be worthless. Simple File Shredder can also
shred free space on multiple drives to securely remove files already deleted
through Windows.

Simple File Shredder v3 provides a new fully customizable System Shredder.
Using the System Shredder, you can easily group browser cache, cookie, and
history files to be located and shredded.

Simple File Shredder will always be 100% free and never contain bundled 3rd-
party software.
