**Publisher's Description**  
  

Enigma Crypter is a text crypter and decrypter which uses ENIGMA cipher from
the second world war. Factually it is basic version of ENIGMA which was used
by units of Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe at the beginning of war. The program uses
the same inner mechanism to be compatible with original ENIGMA (it is possible
to decrypt german messages from beginning of war). Compatibility isnA't
guaranteed for later versions of ENIGMA with more scramblers and different
inner connections, and also for marine version of ENIGMA which was used by
units of Kriegsmarine.
