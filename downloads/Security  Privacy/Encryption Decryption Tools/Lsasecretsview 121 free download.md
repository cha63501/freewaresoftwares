**Publisher's Description**  
  

LSASecretsView is a small utility that displays the list of all LSA secrets
stored in the Registry on your computer.

The LSA secrets key may contain your RAS/VPN passwords, Autologon password,
and other system passwords/keys.

**What's New in version 1.21:**

  * Fixed a problem with Application Compatibility Engine on Windows 7/Vista: In some rare circumstances, this utility was shimmed by Application Compatibility Engine, which means that apphelp.dll and AcLayers.DLL were loaded into the process and replaced the Windows API pointers in the exports table. This API replacement caused this utility to crash lsass.exe and restart the operating system after a minute. This problem occured when running this utility from NirLauncher package, because the executable of NirLauncher contains the word 'launch', and from unknown reason, Microsoft automatically shim every executable that contains the word 'launch'.
