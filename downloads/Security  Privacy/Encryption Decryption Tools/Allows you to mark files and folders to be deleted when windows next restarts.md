**Publisher's Description**  
  


Boot Deleter is an application that adds itself to the Windows Explorer (shell) context menu and allows you to mark files and folders to be deleted when Windows next restarts. 

This will allow you to easily remove items that are locked by running applications. Items can also be marked for deletion by passing the file/folder as a command-line argument or by dropping the item onto the Boot Deleter executable icon.
