**Publisher's Description**  
  


GoAnywhere OpenPGP Studio from Linoma Software is a free tool that makes it easy to protect sensitive files using the popular Open PGP (GPG) encryption standard. Documents can be encrypted, decrypted, signed and verified from your desktop using its intuitive graphical interface. 

An integrated key manager allows you to quickly create, import, export and manage Open PGP keys needed to encrypt and decrypt files. A wide variety of encryption algorithms are supported including AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and TDES ciphers. GoAnywhere OpenPGP Studio runs on most operating systems including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and UNIX. 

GoAnywhere OpenPGP Studio is completely free with no registration requirements. Open PGP is a broadly adopted encryption technology for protecting confidential information such as financial and personal information including PII, PCI and PHI data.

What sets Open PGP apart from conventional encryption is its asymmetric (dual-key) cryptographic system, which utilizes a combination of public and private keys. Messages sent to trading partners are encrypted with their unique A'publicA' key, but can only be decrypted with the secret A'privateA' key. Open PGP ensures that only authorized users (holding the private key) are able to access the protected data.
