**Publisher's Description**  
  


SaveIt will offer your the possibility to password-protect nearly every Windows-application against itA's execution. You may appoint on which computer the program may be executed or of whom. Also you may select if this user must have administration rights or if he must not have them. 

Of course, and this is SaveItA's fortitude, you can use your programs like you are used to use them; open it links or documents.

New in this version is the possibility to protect programs and publish them by, for example, internet or CD-Roms; without SaveIt needs to be installed (only stand-alone-applications).

SaveIt offers you, known from version two, an interior database to warn against programs, which does not cooperate with SaveIt because of strong system-links.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
