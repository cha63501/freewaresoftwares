**Publisher's Description**  
  

File encryption program featuring a new scalable, ultra-fast stream cipher.
The encryption speed is comparable to SEAL 3.0. But unlike SEAL this algorithm
will run twice as fast on a 64-bit machine. We offer a $1000 reward to the
first person who can break it.

The free version functions exactly as the complete product but uses a 32-bits
version of the encryption algorithm (instead of 128-bits.)
