**Publisher's Description**  
  


T-Code is a fast and economical Encoding-/Decoding-Tool for Microsoft Windows. It should run on all systems supporting the 32-Bit-architecture (Windows XP and higher recommended). 

The used encryption algorithm can be regarded as secure and suitable for most of the needs of private and industrial usage. But keep in mind that no encryption utility can be regarded as absolutely secure!

T-Code is fully portable and consumes very low disk-space (less than 1 MB!). It does not write any stuff to the registry. So you can run it from your hard disk and every portable medium (e.g. flash disk, usb-stick). You must have the permission to read/write the directory. 

You can port the T-Code installation to any computer or removable medium by copying the whole directory with all containing files. Just unzip the delivered archive file.
