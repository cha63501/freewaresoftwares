**Publisher's Description**  
  

Encyphalon is an encryption program that protects your data from unauthorized
access.

Utilizing the Rijndael encryption algorithm, you can be assured that no one
will be viewing your sensitive documents. Some applications of this type make
backing up impossible as a secure vault is used which protects from deletion.
Although this is a good idea in theory, the obvious drawback is that the files
are then tied to the application and backups can only be achieved by making
local copies without any kind of security attached. Encyphalon encrypts data
with a user defined password with no such AvaultA in place. Movies, MP3As, all
documents, anything!

Backups can be made by user preference, either onto removable media or local
folders. Multiple users can use the program as there is no password protected
interface. You simply enter your personal password and choose your files to
encrypt/decrypt.

The clean, easy to use interface makes the application a breeze to use.
