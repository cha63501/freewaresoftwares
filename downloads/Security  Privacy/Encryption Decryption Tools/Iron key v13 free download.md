**Publisher's Description**  
  

Iron Key is a utility for encrypting your important files. The encrypted files
can be safely sent over the Internet. The recipient receives a self-extracting
executable which needs a password for proper decrypting. No software is needed
to decrypt the file. Easily integrates with Windows Explorer and other file
managers, supports drag and drop, and uses the industry-standard DES cipher in
the Electronic Codebook mode for data encryption.
