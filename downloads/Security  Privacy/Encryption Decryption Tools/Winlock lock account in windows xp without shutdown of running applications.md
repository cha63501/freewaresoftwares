WinLock is a simple utility, which setting HKLM "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" in register "AutoAdminLogon" to "0" or "1" and controls automatic logon for user "DefaultUserName" with password which you with WinLock setup to "DefaultPassword"... 

WARNING: WinLock do not setup password for Windows account (net user user_name password), only set up password, which will be used for automatic logon - itA's presumed the user have been set up/will set up password himself. With shortcut on desktop you will lock account by one click (rundll32.exe user32.dll, LockWorkStation) and disable automatic logon. After logon by click on "Unlock account pernamently" you will activate automatic logon "without password". 

ItA's important to know, so user password, which is used for automatic logon, is in register saved UNECRYPTED. WinLock was created as compensation for screensavers with password. WinLock is not active program running as system service but only utility which configure logon procedure and until you unlock account pernamently is account guarded by password even if you restart the computer. With combination with disable boot from other drives, suppress "safe mode", "console", Administrator account with password and other ways to sidetrack standard Windows start, will be WinLock guard ability relativly strong. :)

After uninstall is password used for automatic logon "DefaultPassword" set up on blank value automatic logon "AutoAdminLogon" set up on "1" - in case, you will set up password for account set up on blank value (net user user_name ""), system will be started without requesting password automatically.
