**Publisher's Description**  
  

GooglePasswordDecryptor is the FREE tool to instantly recover stored Google
account passwords by various Google applications as well as popular web
browsers. Most of the GoogleA's desktop applications such as GTalk, Picasa etc
store the Google account passwords to prevent hassle of entering the password
every time for the user. Even the web browsers store the sign-on passwords
including Google account passwords in an encrypted format.
GooglePasswordDecryptor automatically crawls through each of these
applications and recovers the encrypted Google account password.

Google uses the single centralized account for managing all of its services
such as Gmail, Picasa, GTalk, iGoogle, Desktop Search etc. Since all of these
core services are controlled by one account, losing the password will easily
make oneA's life miserable. Also trying the Google password recovery service
will turn out to be useless unless you have setup the secondary account for
receiving the password and you remember all the personal details that you have
entered at the time of account creation.

In such cases, GooglePasswordDecryptor helps in recovering any stored Google
account password from various desktop applications & web browsers. It works on
wide range of platforms starting from Windows 2000 to latest operating system
Windows 7.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes a toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.

**WhatA's New in version 2.0:**

  * Support for Password Recovery from Paltalk & Pidgin Messenger. 
  * Includes Automatic Version Checker. 
  * Optional Installer for local Installation and Uninstallation.
