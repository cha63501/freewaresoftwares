EasyCrypt has the ability for the user to create their own encryption key file which can then be kept secure or sent out to other people who may need to decrypt files.

Also provided is a secure file deletion screen, which will allow the user to securely delete a file in the knowledge that it wonA't ever be retrieved by anyone. EasyCrypt can run on Windows Startup and is then always available from the System Tray.
