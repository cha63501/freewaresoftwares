**Publisher's Description**  
  


MailCloak is a groundbreaking new GPG encryption plug-in from Global Web Security Systems (gWebs). MailCloak was designed from the ground up to be the first encryption killer app for IE, FF & mail clients. The Firefox version of MailCloak uses the GNU Privacy Guard (Aka. GnuPG, aka. GPG) to automatically encrypt your emails, attachments and drafts on Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and Microsoft Live Hotmail. 

MailCloak was designed to be extremely easy-to-use A Simply create a public key, turn on MailCloak, and send your friends encrypted email. MailCloak will automatically attach your public key to all outgoing email, and automatically import your friendAs public keys when they send theirs to you A so simply send an email to another MailCloak user to begin communicating securely with GPG encrypted email. 

It usually takes two to tango, so they say, but you can try MailCloak solo by sending email to Cryptobot@gwebs.com. When you send email to Cryptobot with MailCloak installed, Cryptobot will extract your public key, and reply with an encrypted message and itAs own GPG public key. You will then be able to send Cryptobot an encrypted reply! You can also use MailCloak to communicate with other GnuPG, Gpg4win, FireGPG and PGP users. 

Global Web Security also has a desktop application that allows all Microsoft Windows POP3 email users to send GPG encrypted email. If your friends still use POP3 email, you can point them to getmailcloak.com get their copy of MailCloak desktop. Note that MailCloak stores all of your keys and passwords on your own computer, so youAll never have to worry about us sharing this information.
