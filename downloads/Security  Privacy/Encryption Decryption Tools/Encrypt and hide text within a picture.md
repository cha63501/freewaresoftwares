**Publisher's Description**  
  


Picencrypt is probably the safest way to send or keep text secure. The text you want to save is encrypted and hidden within a picture and can only be retrieved using the correct password which is also encrypted within the picture. The fact alone that the text and password is encrypted makes this method extremely safe but the added security off text in a picture adds extra security. 

Who would guess that a picture contains a message? The pictures can of course be saved on your PC or used as an attachment and sent as an email. Using Picencrypt, it would be impossible for any one to decrypt the hidden message without a copy of Picencrypt and the correct password.
