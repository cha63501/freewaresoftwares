**Publisher's Description**  
  


OperaPassView is a small password recovery tool that decrypts the content of the Opera Web browser password file (wand.dat) and displays the list of all Web site passwords stored in this file. You can easily select one or more passwords in the OperaPassView window, and then copy the passwords list to the clipboard and save it into text/html/csv/xml file. 

**System Requirements**

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 7/2008. You can use this utility even if Opera Web browser is not installed on your system, as long as you have the wand.dat filename. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.10:**

  * Fixed to detect properly the passwords of login.live.com and probably other Web sites. 
  * Added /RawExport command-line option to export Opera wand file into a raw text file (without detecting which fields are the user names and passwords). This option is useful when OperaPassView fails to detect the user name / password field properly and displays other fields instead. 
  * Added /LoadWand command-line option to specify the desired wand file to load.
