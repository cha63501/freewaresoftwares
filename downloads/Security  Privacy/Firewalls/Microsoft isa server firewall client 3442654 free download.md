**Publisher's Description**  
  

As an ISA Server administrator, you can deploy the Firewall Client software on
the client computers in your corporate network. In this way, these clients can
have broader application access on the Internet; the client software enables
clients to send requests to all Windows Sockets (Winsock)-based applications.
Furthermore, as the administrator, you can configure a user-based firewall
policy, which depends on the authentication credentials that the Firewall
Client can present. This version of the Firewall Client software enables the
installation of the Firewall Client on 32-bit and 64-bit computers.
