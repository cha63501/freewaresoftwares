**Publisher's Description**  
  

TodayA's Internet exposure must be protected at all levels and Application
Layer Firewalls are an emerging technology providing a needed higher level of
protection to Web Servers given the new class of attacks over the HTTP
protocol layer.

IisShield is an IIS isapi filter preventing any known and unknown attacks from
disrupting IIS. The preventive approach of IisShield is an added value
preventing IIS from even trying to interpret requests trying to break-in. With
a detailed logging engine, IisShield helps IIS administrators to know in
advance and protect IIS from known or unknown HTTP attacks that flow over the
Internet.

The configuration is quite detailed giving the ability to precisely decide
over what is accepted and what is not regarding the HTTP Layer. RFC Compliance
is just one of the core features of IisShield offering an assurance of quality
of service to the IIS Administrator.

IisShield runs in IIS 4.0, IIS 5.x and IIS 6.0.
