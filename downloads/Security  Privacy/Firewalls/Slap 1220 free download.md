**Publisher's Description**  
  

If youA're like me you run firewall software that tells you when someone tries
to access your system. Sometimes I respond with a few packets of my own just
to let them know that I am paying attention.

Slap responds to access attempts easier and more entertaining than any other
program. You just need to enter the IP address of the person you wish to slap
and click on the Slap button. The program will attempt to access all the ports
in the list and send them a packet with a personal message. Slap integrates
with Black Ice and Zone Alarm and can use information received from these
software firewalls to Auto Slap intruders and add their attacks to your list
of responses.

Here is a cool [Wav](http://downloads.freewarefiles.com/files/slap.wav) file
to use with this.
