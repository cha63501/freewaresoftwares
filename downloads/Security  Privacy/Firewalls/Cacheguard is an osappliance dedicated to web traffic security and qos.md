**Publisher's Description**  
  


CacheGuard is an OS/Appliance dedicated to Web traffic Security and QoS. It transforms a x86-based machine into a powerful Web Gateway Appliance. 

It allows you to protect Web surfers and Web servers against all threats coming from the Web. Also it optimizes Web traffic to save your network bandwidth and distributes Web contents with a high Quality of Service.

This pre packaged VMware version is intended to run under VMware server (or equivalent system: VMware fusion...). To run under Vmware ESX, vmdk files should be converted from the "2gbsparse" format to the "thin/thick" format - Use the ESX command "vmkfstools" to convert vmdk files (the command should be applied to the main vmdk file only: cacheguard.vmdk).
