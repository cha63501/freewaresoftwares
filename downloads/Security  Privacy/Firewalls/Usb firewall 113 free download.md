**Publisher's Description**  
  

USB FireWall is an application which protects you from all malevolent programs
which try to launch itself as soon as a peripheral USB is inserted. It will
inform you if ever such a program is in one of your peripherals USB. You can
remove the malevolent file and the file autorun.inf which launches it with the
ADeleteA button.

As soon as USB FireWall is launching, it works in the background task, its
window is posted only when one program tries to launch out automatically since
a peripheral USB.

USB FireWall is freeware and its functionality is limited, if ever the
malevolent program is already present in your system, it tries to stop it but
a patch or an Antivirus program is adapted much more to this kind of problem.

USB FireWall is ahead-first with Windows Optimum which makes much more than to
stop or remove a file or to kill a program.

USB FireWall can also clean all your partitions for autolaunched Application
from partition by deleting autorun file and its application pointed to.
