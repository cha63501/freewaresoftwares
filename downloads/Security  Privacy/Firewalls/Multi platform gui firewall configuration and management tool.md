**Publisher's Description**  
  


Firewall Builder, also known as Fwbuilder, is a vendor-neutral configuration and management application for firewalls. The application was created for the Linux operating system; versions are available for other operating systems, including Windows and Macintosh. Both network administrators and hobbyists managing home-based local area networks (LANs) can simplify management tasks with the application. Fwbuilder supports the OpenBSD Packet Filter, Cisco PIX Series security devices, and iptables and ipfilter Linux utilities. 

Fwbuilder allows for the simultaneous management of multiple firewalls on multiple servers. Programming components called policy compilers facilitate generation of firewall policy rules without the need for the administrator to remember all of the details for each firewall or server. The policy compilers also ensure that firewalls are "sane" -- that is, that there are no contradictions or errors that would interfere with the intended and legitimate use of the network by its subscribers.
