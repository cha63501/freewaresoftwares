Free Comodo Memory Firewall adds another critical layer of security to home
and business PCAs by monitoring for and preventing most types of buffer
overflow attacks. These attacks occur when a malicious program or script
addresses more data to its memory buffer than it can store. The goal of most
attacks is to destabilize the system then install malware onto the victim PC
in order to execute a range of attacks such as identity and data theft.

protect their systems and detects suspicious code executions in the stack or
the heap portions of the memory.

  * Detection of Buffer Overflows which occur in the STACK memory, 
  * Detection of Buffer Overflows which occur in the HEAP memory, 
  * Detection of ret2libc attacks,
