**Publisher's Description**  
  


If youA're like me you run firewall software that tells you when someone tries to access your system. Sometimes I respond with a few packets of my own just to let them know that I am paying attention. 

Slap responds to access attempts easier and more entertaining than any other program. You just need to enter the IP address of the person you wish to slap and click on the Slap button. The program will attempt to access all the ports in the list and send them a packet with a personal message. Slap integrates with Black Ice and Zone Alarm and can use information received from these software firewalls to Auto Slap intruders and add their attacks to your list of responses.

Here is a cool [Wav](http://downloads.freewarefiles.com/files/slap.wav) file to use with this.
