**Note: When you initially start NxFilter, the Admin password is "admin".**

If you are looking for DNS filtering software, then consider NxFilter. This
freeware can help you monitor Internet use on your network with relative ease.
In addition, the software will help you block malware and botnet using DNS
packet inspection. Although many new routers incorporate firewalls and other
filters to protect against online attacks, the filters generally offer very
limited configuration. NxFilter filters both outgoing and incoming network
traffic and provides a complete log with web browsing history.

**Main Features:**

  * Accelerating Internet speed using local DNS cache 
  * Load-balancing and fail-safe 
  * Remote user filtering 
  * Active Directory integration 
  * Group or user based policy assignment 
  * Botnet and malware detection 
  * Phishing protection 
  * Blocking by domain category 
  * Block reason view in block page 
  * Dual policy for both free and work time 
  * Three types of user authentication 
  * Unlimited custom categories 
  * Whitelist and blacklist 
  * Dashboard and reporting 
  * Embedded DB and webserver 
  * Support for internationalized domain name 
  * Syslog exportation 
  * E-mail alert 
  * Compatible with Windows and Linux systems 

**Using NxFilter**

The software started its service as soon as we installed it. We could access
its main interface through any web browser and typing our computerAs hostname
or IP address. A web page was then opened that allowed us to monitor Internet
use in real time.

We used the buttons at the top of the programAs interface to make a variety of
configurations, including sending of automatic e-mails depending on specified
alerts. That was a handy feature because it could let us know immediately when
someone tried to attack our system or computer. We even used the program to
block network users from accessing certain websites.

The history section gave us a list of users and the websites they accessed,
and the software enabled us to adjust the time it took before the log was
displayed.

We improved our ability to block malware by blocking domains that phishing
websites are known to use. The program can also be used to block programs that
use DNS.

**Pros**

  * NxFilter installs as a service 
  * The main interface can be accessed via any web browser 
  * Provides a list of likely phishing sites 
  * Allows blocking of unwanted sites 
  * Ability to view user logs within specified intervals 

**Cons**

  * Although it is relatively easy to use NxFilter, some of its configurations can challenge users 
NxFilter is a handy tool for administrators who want to monitor Internet use
and block malware. You need Java 1.6 or higher to use the freeware.
