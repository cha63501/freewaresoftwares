**Publisher's Description**  
  

XPFiremon is a system tray monitoring application for the built-in Windows XP
Firewall. It will monitor the settings and services and alert if they are
stopped or disabled. Windows should also alert you if the firewall is disabled
but depending on the circumstances it appears slow to do so. ItA's also
comforting to many users to see something saying that their protection is
active and not just inactive. It also provides an easy right click interface
for managing the firewall(stopping, starting, or configuring).
