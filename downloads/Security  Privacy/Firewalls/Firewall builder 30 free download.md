**Publisher's Description**  
  

Firewall Builder, also known as Fwbuilder, is a vendor-neutral configuration
and management application for firewalls. The application was created for the
Linux operating system; versions are available for other operating systems,
including Windows and Macintosh. Both network administrators and hobbyists
managing home-based local area networks (LANs) can simplify management tasks
with the application. Fwbuilder supports the OpenBSD Packet Filter, Cisco PIX
Series security devices, and iptables and ipfilter Linux utilities.

Fwbuilder allows for the simultaneous management of multiple firewalls on
multiple servers. Programming components called policy compilers facilitate
generation of firewall policy rules without the need for the administrator to
remember all of the details for each firewall or server. The policy compilers
also ensure that firewalls are "sane" -- that is, that there are no
contradictions or errors that would interfere with the intended and legitimate
use of the network by its subscribers.
