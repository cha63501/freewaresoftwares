A firewall for Windows using drivers supplied by NTKernel. Allowing for developers/users to create and use plugins to customize their firewall. 

Getting Started: Install the msi in the downloads section! After installing, you may need to restart. Firebwall starts automatically on restart, but does not start automatically after the installer.

The main window will popup after this, and a taskbar item for the application will show up. The first tab in the main window is the log area, all log information will be dumped here, as well to a pcap file for each adapter. The second tab is where you can check out each adapter and change its settings. You can disable all modules on the adapter, or configure each Module. The third tab is for some general configuration. Currently it just contains a check box for turning off popups.

Each module has its own configuration tab. When developing a module, if the module does not have a UserControl that edits the configuration, it will not show up as a tab.

To close the firewall, right click on the taskbar item for the firewall) and click exit. Closing the main window will just minimize it to the taskbar.
