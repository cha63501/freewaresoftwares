**Publisher's Description**  
  

R-Firewall is an effective and easy-to-use solution to secure your on-line
activity. It protects a computer connected to a local network and/or to the
Internet against any intrusions, attacks, trojans, spyware, and other external
and internal threats.

R-Firewall also filters out inappropriate Internet pages content and blocks
dangerous active components you may get while browsing over the Internet or
receiving e-mail massages.

Automatic configuration during setup allows you securely surf the Internet
right after the software installation. Mobile users can create multiple and
easily switchable configurations for specific network environments (Internet
surfing at home, office local networks, or public Wi-Fi spots).
