**Publisher's Description**  
  

SensiveGuard comprises a powerful network firewall and a real-time file-guard
to protect your PC against malicious software and hackers. Detects and stops
malicious operations before damage is done. Blocks unauthorized access to any
selected folders and files that occurs without your manual initiation.

Powerful policies can be set regarding program identities, network zones,
network protocols, file types, and user initiation conditions. Built-in
policies allow most common network and file accesses without bothering users
with endless warnings, such as allowing file sharing in local network while
prevent file access from the Internet, allowing website and email access while
prevent networked programs from downloading executable files without user
approval.

Other features include: self-protection against viruses and hackers;
comprehensive logging for easy audit; no user configuration required after
installation, and yet advanced users can configure policy details in a
graphical user interface.
