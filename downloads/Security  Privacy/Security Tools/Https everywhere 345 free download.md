**Publisher's Description**  
  

HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox extension produced as a collaboration between
The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It encrypts your
communications with a number of major websites.

Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS,
but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted
HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site.

The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests
to these sites to HTTPS.

HTTPS Everywhere can protect you only when youA're using sites that support
HTTPS and for which HTTPS Everywhere includes rules.
