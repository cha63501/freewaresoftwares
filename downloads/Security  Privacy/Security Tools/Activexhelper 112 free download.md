**Publisher's Description**  
  

ActiveXHelper is a small utility that allows you to view essential information
about ActiveX components installed on your computer. You can view the entire
(and very large !) list of ActiveX components by loading it from
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID Registry key, or alternatively, display only the
ActiveX components that you specify.

In addition, you can temporarily disable specific ActiveX components. When
ActiveX components are disabled, they cannot be used by any software, until
you enable them again.
