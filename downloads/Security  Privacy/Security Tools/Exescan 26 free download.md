**Publisher's Description**  
  

ExeScan is the FREE command-line tool to detect anomalies in PE (Portable
Executable or EXE/DLL) files.

It instantly scans EXE/DLL file and reports all kind of abnormalities in the
PE header fields such as checksum differences, header field sizes, non-
ascii/empty section names, improper size of raw data, etc.

Typically Malwares use packers/protectors to pack their EXE. These packers
modify PE header fields in EXE file to make reverse engineering of these
malwares difficult. For example these anomalies in PE header can crash
debugger thus preventing any attempt to reversing. In such cases ExeScan can
come handy by helping you to quickly detect such anomalies.

**Features:**

  * Instantly detect all kind of abnormalities in EXE/PE file. 
  * Detect the type of Compiler/Packer used in the PE file. 
  * Scan for commonly used malware APIs 
  * Great for automation 
  * Displays PE header and Import table structures 
  * Generate detailed analysis report 
ExeScan is successfully tested on all windows systems including Windows NT,
2K, XP, Vista, Windows 7.

**Requires:**

  * Python - http://python.org/ >= 2.5 PEfile - http://code.google.com/p/pefile/
