**Publisher's Description**  
  

There are high chances that you have used a flash drive to transfer some files
between different computers and devices. While these drives make it convenient
to share content with others, they also pose the risk of spreading viruses.
Your flash drive may get infected as soon as you plug it into a computer with
viruses. You will not only risk transferring the virus to your own system but
also losing data stored in the flash drive.

Thankfully, NTFS Drive Protection can protect your flash drive from infection
even if you use it on an infected computer. The handy utility makes it
impossible for malware to create autorun.inf by making a drive read-only.

Protecting a flash drive requires three steps, and removing protection takes
two steps only. The second protection step, which is optional, allows you to
create an unprotected folder.

NTFS Drive Protection is a portable free tool that is easy to use.
