**Publisher's Description**  
  


Children can learn many things from the Internet, but not all of them are good. Parents and guardians must take proactive steps to ensure these young minds do not get polluted by using programs that filter out bad websites. One such program is DNS Angel. 

This portable freeware automatically blocks inappropriate websites to ensure not only children but all computer users stay safe. Parents do not have to wonder which websites to block, as the program accepts only family-safe IPs.

All you need to do is launch DNS Angel and click on one of the family-safe IPs provided. It changes the connection immediately and informs you of the status. A green AloveA symbol shows your computer is safe while a crossed AskullA symbol shows the opposite. Once you have chosen an IP, it will remain active even when you close DNS Angel.

The application also allows you to restore your computerAs original configuration.

DNS Angel will not only protect your computer users from adult content but also protect the computer itself against malware by blocking websites known to serve them.
