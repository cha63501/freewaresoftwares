**Publisher's Description**  
  

PrivDog is a free browser application that protects your privacy while making
your browser run faster, and more securely. Because PrivDog allows no flash,
or pop-up ads, browser speeds increase by up to 50%.

Unlike other advertising security applications, we protect the advertising
eco-system on the internet. PrivDog protects consumers as they can still
access free content. We protect advertisers, as they can still get their same
traffic levels, and publishers, who can receive the same revenue from website
impressions and clicks.

The application complements existing antivirus and internet security suites to
offer users full protection against malvertising.

**Supports:** Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Comodo Dragon, and Comodo Ice Dragon web browsers.
