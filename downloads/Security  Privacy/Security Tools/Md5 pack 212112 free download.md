**Publisher's Description**  
  

MD5 signatures are 32 hex digit strings derived from (binary) files by a
highly specific algorithm. Files that differ only slightly have completely
different signatures. Also, it is really extremely unlikely that two different
files have the same signatures.

MD5 signatures can therefore be useful to verify the integrity of files e.g.
after copying. The two utilities presented here enable you to make and check
signatures in an easy and quick way.

This pack contains the latest updates. They have been tested for Windows
Vista, XP, 2000 and 98. Installing a newer version is automatically preceded
by an uninstall procedure.

The MD5Maker can be started from the ExplorerA's context menu when you right-
click on a selection. MD5 signatures of ALL the files in this selection -
including the files in its directories and subdirectories - are calculated and
stored in the MD5 Signature File.

The MD5Verify program has the MD5 extension associated to the program. This
makes starting the program possible by double-clicking on an MD5 Signature
File. All signatures are checked against the corresponding files. Both
programs support drag and drop.
