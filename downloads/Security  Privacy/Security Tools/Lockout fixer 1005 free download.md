**Publisher's Description**  
  

Lock out fixer is a free tool that helps administrators to troubleshoot the
locking out of domain accounts. It works like the Microsoft tool
Lockoutstatus.exe but in addition to just checking lock out time for all the
domain controllers, it allows you to instantly view the audit failure logs
written exactly at the time of the account lock out or bad password time. The
event log shows the client IP address using which we can easily identify the
issues.

**This is how it works:**

  1. You check the servers you want to query from the list of detected domain controllers, type in a username... Then you can either unlock the account or you can check for the lockout status... 
  2. If you check the lock out status, it displays the lock out time, Last bad password time and bad password count for each of the domain controllers you selected... The time displayed is in the time zone of remote computer...You can again check the items you need and query for the audit failure logs that occured at the lock out time on the selected servers... If the account is not locked, then it will query for the logs occured at bad password time.. 
  3. There is also a seperate event log query tool, which allows you to enter any computer name and check for all the logs.. Again, time should be entered based on the time zone of the remote computer.
