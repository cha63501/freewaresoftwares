**Publisher's Description**  
  

Autorun viruses are getting more and more popular these days and they infect
more and more USB drives. You may protect your computer with an antivirus
program, but what do you do when you have to plug your USB into another
computer? Your USB flash drive is exposed.

Now, you can stop that in the most simple way: Protect My Disk. It is a simple
program that helps you protect your USB flash drive against autorun viruses.
NO extra space used and NO programs installed on your USB flash drive. The
program analyzes your flash drive, cleans the known viruses (if any) and
creates 2 special folders that prevent Windows to copy autorun files and
viruses through virus programs to your USB flash drive. AND ITA'S FREE!

The program does not interfere in any way with your antivirus program. The
program works with any type of USB flash drive and with memory cards. You can
even protect your hard drive partitions.
