**Publisher's Description**  
  


Autorun Eater was born due to the increase of malwares using the Aautorun.infA method to infect users unknowingly be it from flash drives, removable hard disks or any other removable storage device. 

When a device is infected with a malware and an Aautorun.infA file is dropped, the shell menu is normally modified to execute the malware whenever the unsuspecting user accesses the infected drive.

Autorun Eater will warn you and remove any suspicious Aautorun.infA files(based on user decision/settings) so that the malware is not executed while accessing the infected drive. There are also certain cases whereby the malware has been removed by an antivirus but the Aautorun.infA file remains. This will cause the drive to be inaccessible through the conventional method(double-click). Autorun Eater will also remove it if necessary so that you can access the drive as usual.

**Features:**

  * Prevent malware infection through removable storage devices(pendrives, portable hard disk, etc)
  * Install and forget, Autorun Eater monitors all drives(except A:, B:, and CD/DVD drives) in real time!
  * Manually scan drives A: and B: if you have access to either one or both(eg. Floppy)
  * Scan the infected storage device automatically with Microsoft Security Essentials
  * Pause at any time
  * Deleted suspicious Aautorun.infA file(s) are auto-backupAed
  * Events are logged for future reference
  * Fix 3 common critical registry changes made by malwares

You can install the new version over the old version (exit v2.5 first).
