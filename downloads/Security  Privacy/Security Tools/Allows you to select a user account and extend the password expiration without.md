**Publisher's Description**  
  


Have you ever gotten the call from the Road Warrior or frequent business traveller saying: AI am on the road and I canAt log into the VPNA? It is a common problem and happens frequently because end-users forget to change their passwords before they leave for that stressful trip. In some cases we ask them for their password and set the password to be the same. In other cases we set a new password, but now the cached laptop password is different from their domain or VPN password causing confusion. In either case we might have compromised the account as others might have overheard the conversation. In some cases, we even say they are out of luck until they return to the office.   
  
This is where the AD Password Extender can help. The AD Password Extender is a free Windows tool that allows you to select a user account and extend the password expiration date by the amount of days specified in your Group Policy. This is often helpful when you have end-users who are travelling and canAt log into the VPN or other Active Directory authenticated system. By extending the expiration you ensure that accounts donAt get compromised by communicating the password across insecure channels.
