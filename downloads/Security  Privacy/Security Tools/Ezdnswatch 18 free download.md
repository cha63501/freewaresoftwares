**Publisher's Description**  
  

EZDNSWatch will keep an eye on your DNS settings and let you know if something
changes them. You can easily change them back if this happens.

EZDNSWatch will even check your wired or wireless router for hacking
vulnerabilities. We use the same techniques that viruses and trojans use, but
weA're the good guys and weA'll tell you if you need to do something to make
sure your router cannot easily be hacked.

EZDNSWatch also supports OpenDNS. OpenDNS is a free public DNS server that is
guaranteed safe and also provides protection from phishing and other dangerous
sites you might accidentally encounter while browsing the Internet.

It is also recommended to use OpenDNS instead the normal DNS server. In many
cases it also provides a noticeable speed boost because most DNS servers
provided by ISPA's are much slower than OpenDNSA's servers. EZDNSWatch makes
using OpenDNS quick and easy. You donA't need to do anything except check the
box in EZDNSWatch and you will automatically start using OpenDNS.

EZDNSWatch is totally free for personal use. It installs in seconds and will
silently watch and protect your DNS settings from being hijacked or tampered
with. It is a must have utility.
