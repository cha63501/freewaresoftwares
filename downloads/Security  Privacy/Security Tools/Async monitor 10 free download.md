**Publisher's Description**  
  

Async Monitor provides the ability to remotely monitor activeity on your
computer system remotely via the web in near-real time.

Async Monitor helps keep your system running smoothly by allowing system
administrators to identify and remove any rogue applications running on the
system, determine if users are visiting any unauthorized websites, and prevent
any behavior that is not consistant with your system usage policies.

Async Monitor creates screen grab images of the most foreground window at
specified intervals (default is every 10 seconds) whenever there is any
activity on your system. These images are uploaded to your Async Monitor web
account, available for instant viewing. This enables a system administrator to
prevent any unwanted behavior by users of a system before potential issues
arise.

**Note:** Async Monitor requires you to create a free web account with Pixelhat.com.
