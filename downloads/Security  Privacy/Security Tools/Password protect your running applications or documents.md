**Publisher's Description**  
  


LockThis! is a tiny Windows utility that makes it possible to password protect almost any programs or documents thatA's currently running/open. This tool is perfect for people who often lend their PC to others, because with this tool they can keep the content of some programs or documents from other people eyes without need to close them first. Huge time saver if you really often lend your PC. 

ItA's very easy to apply the protection. All you have to do is pressing Ctrl btn while minimizing the window of the program/document and supply the password in the dialog that follows. Now the content is saved because the window can not be restored or maximized without supplying the correct password. Whever the window is about to be restored or maximized a dialog asking for password will pop up. If the correct password is not supplied, the restore or maximize request is simply ignored and the window stays minimized.

However please do not rely solely on LockThis! to protect really sensitive matters. Although in the latest version we have password protected every mission critical area, there are still ways to close LockThis! by force. Once LockThis! has terminated the protection it applied, it will be nullified. We employ this failsafe protection because we donA't want you to be kept off from your work after accidentally closing LockThis!

**Note:** The default password for the admin panel is "LockThis!".
