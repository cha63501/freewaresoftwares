**Publisher's Description**  
  


A handy utility that sits in the tasktray, allowing hotkey shredding files, file hashes to be generated, and complementing several OTFE (On-The-Fly Encryption) systems by providing rapid access to their most used day-to-day functions, making them considerably easier to use. 

Also incorporates self-destruct facilities for sensitive material, triggerable by hotkey, easily-built serial connector or secure Internet connection.

**Features:**

  * Support for several On-The-Fly Encryption (OTFE) systems: 
    * FreeOTFE 
    * BestCrypt 
    * CrossCrypt 
    * E4M 
    * PGPDisk 
    * ScramDisk 
    * TrueCrypt 
  * OTFE support allows user definable programs to be executed on mount/dismount 
  * Removes BestCryptA's inability to use BestCrypt volume files stored within subdirectories 
  * Can compute the MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, RIPEMD-320, Tiger and GOST R 34.11-94 hash digests of any file (can optionally be configured as a shell extension) 
  * Sits in the tasktray for convenience 
  * Rapid use of security features by rightclicking a tasktray icon 
  * Can be used on itA's own for hotkey destruction of sensitive files, or used in conjunction with ScramDisk 
  * Fast access to the most used OTFE functions such as mounting/dismounting volumes and viewing volume info 
  * Ability to mount volumes (including ScramDisk volumes) as read-only 
  * Details of encrypted volume files mounted 
  * Hotkey dismounting of encrypted volumes 
  * File shredder (Gutmann or pseudorandom passes) 
  * Ability to shred free space (including slack) on your HDD (Gutmann or pseudorandom passes) 
  * "Self-destruct" functionality: 
    * Ability to destroy sensitive files and/or any encrypted volumes mounted upon pressing a user defined hotkey ("self-destruct"!) 
    * Ability to destroy sensitive files and/or any encrypted volumes mounted upon activation of a trigger switch connected to a serial port 
    * Ability to destroy sensitive files and/or any encrypted volumes mounted upon receiving a connection via the internet that is authenticated correctly 
    * Ability to delete registry entries automatically 
    * On "self-destruct", the system clock is changed for security reasons 
  * When used under NT, SecureTrayUtil has the capability of enabling NTA's pagefile overwrite-on shutdown facility (see Microsoft knowledgebase article Q182086: How to Clear the Windows NT Paging File at Shutdown) 
  * Keyboard dialog to allow users to enter their passwords by clicking onscreen letters with a mouse instead of using the keyboard (ScramDisk support only; this functionality is available as Delphi Component that can be downloaded with the source code) 
  * Runs under MS Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP 
  * Source code freely available for download 
  * Does not make any entries in the registry (unless specifically requested to). Configuration is held in an easily destroyed ".ini" file 
  * Ability to "touch" user selected files date/timestamps on startup/exit/regular intervals 
  * Search for encrypted volume files functionality 
  * ...And more!
