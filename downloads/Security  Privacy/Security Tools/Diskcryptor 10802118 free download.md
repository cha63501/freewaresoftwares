**Publisher's Description**  
  

DiskCryptor - is the only truly free solution, provided under GNU General
Public License (GPLv3), which offers encryption of all disk partitions,
including the system one. The main criterion for an open software, is the
availability of its source code under one of the open source licenses. The
only analogous to DiskCryptor software, with the open source code, is the
TrueCrypt. However, because of the restrictive license under which the
TrueCrypt is provided, - the TrueCrypt Collective License, TrueCrypt cannot be
classified as a truly free software, as it places limits for developers, on
the use and modification of its source code. The other similar in function to
DiskCryptor programs, are fully proprietary ones, which makes them
unacceptable to use for protection of a confidential data.

Originally, DiskCryptor was conceived as a replacement for DriveCrypt Plus
Pack and PGP Whole Disk Encryption, now however, the aim of the development of
the project, is the creation of the best in its category, software. Moreover,
in the future, considerable effort will be devoted to creation of a detailed
documentation, explaining the internal mechanics of the program, which would
be the best confirmation and demonstration of its security.

DiskCryptor is since version 0.5 not compatible with the TrueCrypt, as it uses
own partition format, and encrypts data with AES-256, Twofish or Serpent
algorithms in XTS mode. Cascaded modes are available, too.
