**Publisher's Description**  
  

Security System Analyzer is a tool designed to check your system for the
latest security updates.

Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) is an international,
information security, community standard to promote open and publicly
available security content, and to standardize the transfer of this
information across the entire spectrum of security tools and services.

OVAL includes a language used to encode system details, and an assortment of
content repositories held throughout the community. The language standardizes
the three main steps of the assessment process: representing configuration
information of systems for testing; analyzing the system for the presence of
the specified machine state (vulnerability,configuration, patch state, etc.);
and reporting the results of this assessment.

After using it during my security assessments, I was completely happy with
results. It helps me out to find out new attack vectors and undetected
vulnerabilities reported by the usual automated scanners.

The command line release (by mitre.org) is sometimes hard to manage (copying
new xml files, editing .html reports), so we decided to write a GUI to make it
simple to use and understand and then free the security testers community to
take advantage of it.

**What's New in version 1.6 Beta 2:**

  * Updated OVAL Security Check Plugin to support OVAL 5.4 schema 
  * Proxy support of NTLM authentication 
  * Reported Bugs fixed 
  * Draft documentation delayed (sorry guys, weAve urged to release beta 2 to fix errors generated with OVAL 5.3 schema)
