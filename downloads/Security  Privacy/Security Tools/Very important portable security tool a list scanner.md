**Publisher's Description**  
  


WebESC is a very important portable security tool to scan for any change in your list of local or web files. It is intended mostly for advanced computer users. It is very fast. List for scanning, in FLS file, is created by WebESC initial scan, or by your application if any, or manually by you. The FLS data reflects the current state of scanned files so when comparing to one taken at another time, WebESC will provide discrepancies between the two. You can compare your local or web files for any changes, e.g. by a virus or hacker or legally by some application. WebESC will not remove a virus but it can detect a file change that many of antivirus programs omit, so it would be best to run them both. 

WebESC in local mode helps you to track the file changes on your computer. For example, list of hard disk files, or your storage on CD/DVD (if burning was reliable or there was a media damage), or USB memory. You can also compare two different folders by using the relative paths, meaning you can check your backups.

WebESC in web mode can verify that web links exist, and also changes in sizes of web files without downloading them. You can compare your web pages stored locally on your disk to those on your web site, i.e. you can verify that all the files are succesfully uploaded or have been changed by any. If you have the web links to other web sites you can check the broken links and file version changes. For example, on release date, WebESC could check RapidShare web links if broken.
