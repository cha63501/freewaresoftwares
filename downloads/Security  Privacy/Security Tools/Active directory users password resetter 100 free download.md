**Publisher's Description**  
  

This handy tool allows you to reset Active Directory userA's passwords, and
unlock locked out accounts without having to open Active Directory and
searching for the user. ItA's especially useful if you need to delegate
password reset access to staff but donA't want them to have the full Active
Directory installed.

Please note, just like Active Directory this doesnA't automatically give
anyone with the application access to reset passwords, they would also need
delegated access given separately.
