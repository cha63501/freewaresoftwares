**Publisher's Description**  
  

Children can learn many things from the Internet, but not all of them are
good. Parents and guardians must take proactive steps to ensure these young
minds do not get polluted by using programs that filter out bad websites. One
such program is DNS Angel.

This portable freeware automatically blocks inappropriate websites to ensure
not only children but all computer users stay safe. Parents do not have to
wonder which websites to block, as the program accepts only family-safe IPs.

All you need to do is launch DNS Angel and click on one of the family-safe IPs
provided. It changes the connection immediately and informs you of the status.
A green AloveA symbol shows your computer is safe while a crossed AskullA
symbol shows the opposite. Once you have chosen an IP, it will remain active
even when you close DNS Angel.

The application also allows you to restore your computerAs original
configuration.

DNS Angel will not only protect your computer users from adult content but
also protect the computer itself against malware by blocking websites known to
serve them.
