**Publisher's Description**  
  

Vista has introduced new feature called UAC (User Account Control). In short
it basically controls the way in which applications are executed by different
users. Due to enforcement of this UAC, by default any application on Vista
will run under the context of standard user instead of administrator. As a
result the application which requires administrator privilege will fail to
work properly on Vista.

So VistaUACMaker is designed to address this problem by making any Windows XP
based application compatible with Vista as well as Windows 7.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes a toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.

**What's New in version 2.5:**

  * Integrated Installer for local Installation & Uninstallation. New Banner and other minor UI improvements.
