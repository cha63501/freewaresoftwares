**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Security Restore application was developed to be a small tool that will
simply attempt to restore your computer to the default security settings. This
is useful for when you get, AYou donAt have permission toA blah, blah, blahA
errors, while installing programs or updating stuff.

It will also attempt to repair the dreaded 0A80070005 error messages when
trying to register dll files while installing certain Windows components or
programs. Sometimes you will not get this specific error number, but just an
Installation Failed message. This tool will in most cases also repair these
errors, for example: Internet Explorer 7 installation failure and permission
errors while installing BitDefender AntiVirus.

This should only be used when you actually have something wrong with your
computer. This will normally be after a virus attack and you are trying to
register components, for example: when you try and update a Windows
installation. Also, when you try to install a Anti Virus program after virus
removal and you keep on receiving permission errors. This utility replaces the
popular Rizone 0A80070005 FIX.
