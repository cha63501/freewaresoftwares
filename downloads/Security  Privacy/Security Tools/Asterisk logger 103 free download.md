**Publisher's Description**  
  

Many applications, like CuteFTP, CoffeeCup Free FTP, VNC, IncrediMail, Outlook
Express, and others, allows you to type a password for using it in the
application. The typed password is not displayed on the screen, and instead of
the real password, you see a sequence of asterisk (A'****A') characters. This
utility can reveal the passwords stored behind the asterisks in standard
password text-boxes.

Asterisk Logger is a successor of AsterWin utility. It reveals the asterisk
passwords in the same way as AsterWin utility, but it has some advantages over
the previous utility:

  * You donA't have to press a button in order to reveal the asterisk passwords. Whenever a new window containing a password box is opened, Asterisk Logger automatically reveals the password inside the password-box, and add a record to passwords list in the main window of Asterisk Logger. 
  * Asterisk Logger displays additional information about the revealed password: The date/time that the password was revealed, the name of the application that contains the revealed password box, and the executable file of the application. 
  * Asterisk Logger allows you the save the passwords to HTML file and to 3 types of text files.
