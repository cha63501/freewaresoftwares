**Publisher's Description**  
  

There are various reasons why you may want to surf the Internet anonymously,
including protecting yourself from identity theft. You can easily achieve this
with the help of X-Proxy, a free utility that enables you to use a proxy
server and hide your real IP address.

The application has a user-friendly interface that gives you a list of
available proxy servers, including their respective locations, host names, IPs
and response times. The proxy servers are classified into different groups
based on their levels of security. For example, you may choose among
transparent, anonymous and high anonymous proxies.

You can also use X-Proxy to search for proxy servers from a specific country
or those whose domains you can define. If you want to know how fast a proxy
is, simply use the bundled Internet speed test facility.

Once you have connected to Internet via your chosen proxy server, you will see
its IP address and your real one in the applicationAs main window.
