**Publisher's Description**  
  

ExpertSec Malware Detection Engine is a malware scanner that allows you to
scan and detect what is not right inside the Windows folder, the place where
most of the malware resides.

**How to use it:**  
Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder and double click on the esde
application. An easy to use graphical interface will appear. You need to
select the Windows folder and press the Scan button. After the scan is
finished, by using the default options, a report will be created and if any
files are recognized as suspect, then they will automatically be sent to our
research lab for further analysis. You will also be prompted for your e-mail
so we can reply to you if the file is indeed a malware or not.

Also we have implemented an update function for our malware detection engine,
so you can have the latest detection technology available.
