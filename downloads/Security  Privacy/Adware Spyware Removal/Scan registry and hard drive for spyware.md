HijackThis lists the contents of key areas of the registry and hard drive - areas that are used by both legitimate programmers and hijackers. 

It generates an in depth report of registry and file settings from your computer. HijackThis makes no separation between safe and unsafe settings in its scan results giving you the ability to selectively remove items from your machine. In addition to this scan and remove capability HijackThis comes with several tools useful in manually removing malware from a computer.

The program is continually updated to detect and remove new hijacks. It does not target specific programs and URLs, just the methods used by hijackers to force you onto their sites. 

As a result, false positives are imminent, and unless youA're sure about what youA're doing, you should always consult with knowledgeable folks before deleting anything.
