**Publisher's Description**  
  

SpyMe Tools is very useful in detecting Registry and Disk changes. If any
application installs spyware, adware, dlls, programs, files, or any other type
of file, picture, or program, etc. or changes the RegistryA's content, you
will be able to see exactly where the modification occurred so you can take
measures. It seems like more and more programs are attempting to install
spyware, advertisements, or other garbage without your knowledge, but with
this software you will know everything that is added or removed.

To detect Registry/Disk changes the program will create Dumps of the actual
states of Registry/Disk. This means that at any time you can open the Dump
file and view the contents of the Registry/Disk just as they were when youA've
scanned the Registry/Disk. The program can compare two different dump files so
youA'll see exactly what changed in the Registry/Disk between the two scans.
The program can also restore old states of Registry keys using the data in the
Dump files.

To prevent other persons from viewing your scanned files you may encrypt them
so that a password will be required whenever someone tries to open them.

SpyMe Tools also includes a Real time Disk/Registry monitor so you may spot
the changes in real time. (Real time Disk monitor works only on NT platform,
including Win2k and Win XP).

WhatA's new in this version:

  * The program is now FREEWARE. Enjoy it! 
  * Scan Dump Files can now be encrypted to prevent others from viewing them. 
  * Added automatic update feature. 
  * Improved Realtime Registry Monitor. 
  * Files/Key values can now be custom sorted.
