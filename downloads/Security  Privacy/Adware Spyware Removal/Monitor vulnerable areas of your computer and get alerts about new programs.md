**Publisher's Description**  
  


WinPatrol with Scotty the Windows Watch Dog will sniff out worms, adware, spyware, cookies, Trojan horses, and other nasty programs that may attack your computer. This program puts you back in control of your computer with no need for constant updates. WinPatrolA's goal is to help you better understand what programs are running on your computer and to alert you to any new programs added without your permission. Scotty lets you confirm any new programs or add-ons set up to run on your computer. 

Unlike traditional security programs, WinPatrol doesnA't scan your hard drive searching for previously identified threats. Instead using a heuristic approach, a snapshot is taken of your critical system resources and WinPatrol alerts you to any changes that occur without your knowledge. YouA'll be warned immediately by Scotty and will be removing dangerous new threats while others wait to hear about them on the news. WinPatrol includes enhanced reports and checks for a number of new Internet Explorer helpers and a fix to the disappearing task bar icon quirk in Windows XP.
