**Publisher's Description**  
  

Adware.NDotNet is an adware program that associates non-existent domain names
with sponsored content. When an end-user enters a keyword into a browser
address bar or attempts to resolve a mistaken or non-existent URL, the adware
redirects the user to a sponsored page.

This adware component works as a Browser Helper Object.

Removal Instructions:

This adware program must be manually installed. However, there are several
known programs that have Adware.NDotNet within them and that install it as the
program itself is installed.

Note: Removing this adware component from the system will likely cause the
program that installed it to not function as intended. The uninstaller
generally identifies the programs that will not work after uninstallation.

have other security risks installed. Symantec recommends that the following
steps be carried out:

  1. Run the Removal Tool. 
  2. Update the definitions by starting the Symantec program and running LiveUpdate. 
  3. Run a full system scan to detect any other security risks on the computer. 
  4. If the scan detects any further security risks, check for removal tools at http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security.risks.tools.list.html 
  5. If there are no removal tools for the security risks that are detected, follow the manual removal instructions listed in the risk report.
