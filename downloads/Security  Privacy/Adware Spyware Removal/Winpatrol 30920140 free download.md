**Publisher's Description**  
  

WinPatrol with Scotty the Windows Watch Dog will sniff out worms, adware,
spyware, cookies, Trojan horses, and other nasty programs that may attack your
computer. This program puts you back in control of your computer with no need
for constant updates. WinPatrolA's goal is to help you better understand what
programs are running on your computer and to alert you to any new programs
added without your permission. Scotty lets you confirm any new programs or
add-ons set up to run on your computer.

Unlike traditional security programs, WinPatrol doesnA't scan your hard drive
searching for previously identified threats. Instead using a heuristic
approach, a snapshot is taken of your critical system resources and WinPatrol
alerts you to any changes that occur without your knowledge. YouA'll be warned
immediately by Scotty and will be removing dangerous new threats while others
wait to hear about them on the news. WinPatrol includes enhanced reports and
checks for a number of new Internet Explorer helpers and a fix to the
disappearing task bar icon quirk in Windows XP.
