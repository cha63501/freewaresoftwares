**Publisher's Description**  
  


BugHunter is a DOS based malware scanner which has a frequently updated database of signatures as well as engine updates. The program is designed to quickly scan for and optionally disable/remove any known malware found. BugHunter is able to detect browser hijackers, rogue programs, adware, keyloggers, spyware (including some commercial ones), rootkits which are file based, malicious java/html/vb scripts, and various worms. As BugHunter is DOS based and does not require installation of any sort, it can easily be copied to various media and used to disinfect other systems without those systems having potentially harmful code present in memory. BugHunter gets along fine with most memory resident programs, and supports being run from a boot diskette/cdrom, such as BartPE.
