**Publisher's Description**  
  

BugHunter is a DOS based malware scanner which has a frequently updated
database of signatures as well as engine updates. The program is designed to
quickly scan for and optionally disable/remove any known malware found.
BugHunter is able to detect browser hijackers, rogue programs, adware,
keyloggers, spyware (including some commercial ones), rootkits which are file
based, malicious java/html/vb scripts, and various worms. As BugHunter is DOS
based and does not require installation of any sort, it can easily be copied
to various media and used to disinfect other systems without those systems
having potentially harmful code present in memory. BugHunter gets along fine
with most memory resident programs, and supports being run from a boot
diskette/cdrom, such as BartPE.
