**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bazooka Adware and Spyware Scanner detects a multitude of spyware, adware,
trojan, keylogger, foistware and trackware components; sources of irritation
that antivirus software does not deal with. The scanning process will only
take about two seconds and tell you how to uninstall the invasive threat using
simple step-by-step instructions or put you in contact with the vendor for the
most up-to-date and safe uninstall instructions.

Spyware and adware is often bundled with software such as Kazaa, Morpheus,
Grokster, Imesh, Xolox, Gnutella and a myriad of other programs, and in many
cases installed without your knowledge. Some send information about your
surfing habits to ad companies, which target you with popup ads that fit your
preferences.

Bazooka Adware and Spyware Scanner searches for CoolWebSearch, Gator, GAIN,
Bargain Buddy, CommonName, FlashTrack, IPInsight, n-CASE, NetRatings, SaveNow,
and WurldMedia. Version 1.13.03 may include unspecified updates, enhancements,
and bug fixes.
