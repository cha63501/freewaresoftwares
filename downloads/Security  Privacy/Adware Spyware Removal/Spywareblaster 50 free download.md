**Publisher's Description**  
  

SpywareBlaster doesnA't scan and clean for spyware--it prevents it from ever
being installed. SpywareBlaster blocks the installation of spyware ActiveX
controls (such as Lop.com and Xupiter) in its database, and can even prevent
them from running if they are installed. The built-in Check for Updates
feature allows quick and easy database updates (released frequently).
Information on all spyware covered in the database is also provided.

SpywareBlaster does not need to be running in the background - simply select
the items you wish to be protected against (or select all items), press the
Protect button, and protection is enabled. It can also block spyware/tracking
cookies, and includes a System Snapshot feature, which allows you to take a
snapshot of your computer in its clean state and later revert many changes
made by spyware and browser hijackers.
