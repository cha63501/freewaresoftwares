**Publisher's Description**  
  


This tool will show you how to spy on a spyware. Maybe you are not aware how serious this problem could be. Do you know what is being secretely installed on your computer while you browse web? 

When the application is running it simply monitors system folders for any new exeA's or dllA's being added or renamed: For example Windows and System32 folder is the main harbour for these bugs, but also Program Files or Documents and Settings.

Spy-To-Spy sits in tray and watches folders you specified in settings.

The folders include subfolders so you really just need to set C:\Windows to monitor all additions to Windows and System folders. This is set by default.

Optionally you can add also C:\Program Files and C:\Documents and Settings. (Some Parasites will copy itself here)

**Quarantine**  
You have the option to add selected files to Quarantine. It will brute force kill the processes quickly one after another to avoid watchdogs and move the exe file to a Quarantine folder.

**System File Check**  
Additionally a button for SFC was added. This will run Windows Protection that checks all system files for changes and it will copy them from Windows CD if they are different.

**Legit Files**  
Spy-The-Spy is a file monitor. It doesnA't differentiate between real spyware and a legit file that has been added to watched folders. There are cases when such legit files are created:

  * Windows may on startup replace some dllA's in system folder from its backup 
  * Some virus and anti-spyware scan may create a temporary files to unpack zipped files. AdAware does this for example. 
  * Legitimate sites add dllA's to your computer without any notification. Ebay does this for example.
