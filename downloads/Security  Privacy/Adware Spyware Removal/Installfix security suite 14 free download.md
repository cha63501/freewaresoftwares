**Publisher's Description**  
  

InstallFix Security Suite is a free and useful utility that uses the NSIS
installer package to remove spyware, tracking, and advertising cookies,
harmful programs and viruses, and clear away useless files.

The old "InstallFix" and "MalwareFix" are no more. They have been combined and
re-organized into a security suite that is designed to be more efficient and
functional than its predecessors. The suite contains three programs.

TuffCookie performs the standard and smart cookie scans, while Janitor handles
caches, temp files, history, useless files, and malware. Scan results display
has been drastically improved. The final program, QuickFix, performs a minimal
scan at startup and then closes itself automatically.
