Omega can read, write, search, and interpret the contents of an NTFS formatted hard drive from outside of the Windows operating system. 

In the land of Omega no malware process is running, because the Windows OS is not running. This means that the records on disk are completely static and the malicious code therein is completely harmless to the system. This also means that the operator of the Omega Windows Recovery Agent will no longer be denied, for any reason, the right to access and neutralize any malicious process on disk! This is the freeware beta version made available for non-commercial use only.
