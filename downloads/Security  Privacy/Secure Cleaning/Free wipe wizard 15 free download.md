**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free Wipe Wizard erases private files and wipes sensitive information in a
secure manner. We guarantee that the file erased with Free Wipe Wizard can
never be recovered with any other tool. Even if your disk lands in the hands
of F.B.I. your erased information remains inaccessible. The erased information
will hold secure even if special methods are used to sense weak magnetic
information off your hard disk surface!

Free Wipe Wizard is fully functional and free of charge. The tool takes care
of your files in a simple and efficient manner. Just run the tool, select a
file to delete and click "Delete File" to wipe off its content forever. No
data recovery tool can ever restore the contents of your file - guaranteed!

Not all implementations of secure file delete are equal. Some are just using
zeroes to wipe your data, and some are using weak random key generators. While
these tools defeat software-based data recovery utilities, they fail to
provide the ultimate data security that only a proper tool can guarantee.

Free Wipe Wizard is based on a cryptographically strong open-source code, and
is distributed with GNU General Public License.
