**Publisher's Description**  
  

Eraser is an advanced security tool, which allows you to completely remove
sensitive data from your hard drive by overwriting it several times with
carefully selected patterns.

You can drag and drop files and folders to the on-demand eraser, use the
convenient Explorer shell extension or use the integrated scheduler to program
overwriting of unused disk space or, for example, browser cache files to
happen regularly, at night, during your lunch break, at weekends or whenever
you like.

The patterns used for overwriting are based on Peter GutmannA's paper "Secure
Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory" and they are selected
to effectively remove the magnetic remnants from the hard disk.

Other methods include the one defined in the National Industrial Security
Program Operating Manual of the US Department of Defense and overwriting with
pseudorandom data. You can also define your own overwriting methods.
