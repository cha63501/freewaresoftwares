**Publisher's Description**  
  


Get rid of the annoying security alerts in Microsoft Outlook 2000, 2002/XP, 2003, 2007, 210 and 2013! Advanced Security for Outlook allows you to determine the violator and specify the permanent action for this program (and only this program!) : allow access, block access or run the default Outlook handler. In the future, the specified action will be executed automatically and Outlook Security will not annoy you with messages about trying to access e-mail addresses you have stored in Microsoft Outlook. 

The standard security system has two drawbacks: first, it does not allow users to determine the source of the threat, and second, a lot of other applications developed before the security system appeared can be extremely annoying due to their constantly displayed warnings. Since the security system is constantly updated, a "fresh" program can access a list of such applications quite easily. There is still yet another drawback resulting from the first two: when the user temporarily disables the security system this allows any other program also to work without any security system restrictions. 

This add-in for Outlook solves all of the above problems providing the information not only about the type of alert, but also about what program caused it and makes it possible to specify for this (and only this!) program a permanent course of action: allow access, block access or run the default Outlook handler. Later on you can change or delete the action chosen. It should be mentioned that there is a range of tasks (which is rather narrow) that an Outlook developer can implement only through the use of the object model and its "blocked" methods. In this case, Advanced Security is an indispensable program when using such an application. This program has English, German and Russian interfaces.
