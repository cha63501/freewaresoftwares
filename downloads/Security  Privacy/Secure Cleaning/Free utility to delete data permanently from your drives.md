**Publisher's Description**  
  


Lowvel is a free tool to erase data irreversibly from various data storage devices. Lowvel overwrites data stored on the device with zeroes, i.e. performs so called zero-filling. 

Typically, Lowvel is used to irreversibly erase all the data on the device, force a device to reallocate bad sectors, or improve write performance of an SSD which is not TRIM-capable. Once you erased all the data using Lowvel, this data cannot be recovered any longer.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
