**Why You Need PC Shredder:**

  * When you delete files from a disk on your computer, Windows does not erase the contents of these files from the disk - it only deletes A'referencesA' to these files from files system tables. The contents of all deleted files remain on the disk and can be easily restored using any recovery utility. 
  * After you delete the data, Windows deletes the data but not completely. After deleting the file, its name is only erased from the database whereas all the contents remain there. This way data donA't get deleted completely. Here is the solution for your concern. 
  * DonA't let your PC be unfaithful to you. Use PC Shredder to keep your PC secure and faithful. 
  * PC Shredder allows you easily wipe free space to ensure that previously A'deletedA' files cannot be recovered.
