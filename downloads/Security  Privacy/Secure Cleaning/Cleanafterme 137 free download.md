**Publisher's Description**  
  

CleanAfterMe allows you to easily clean files and Registry entries that are
automatically created by the Windows operating system during your regular
computer work.

With CleanAfterMe, you can clean the cookies/history/cache/passwords of
Internet Explorer, the A'RecentA' folder, the Registry entries that record the
last opened files, the temporary folder of Windows, the event logs, the
Recycle Bin, and more.

CleanAfterMe is a portable application. This means that you can run it without
any installation and without leaving any trace in the Registry.

You can also run this program from a USB flash drive: In order to do that,
simply copy the executable file of CleanAfterMe (CleanAfterMe.exe) into the
USB flash drive, and run it from there.

**What's New in version 1.37:**

  * Removed the option to delete .eml cache files of Windows Live Mail. This option was good for HotMail and IMAP accounts, but for POP3 accounts, it might delete real email messages.
