**Publisher's Description**  
  

As you may already know that there are a lot of free and commercial undelete
programs available on the internet. You may wonder how those undelete programs
can magically bring back deleted files.

Well, thatA's not really a magic at all. When you empty recycle bin in order
to permanently remove deleted files from your hard disk, Windows does not
actually remove them. Instead, for performance reasons, Windows simply marks
the location of deleted files on hard disk as unoccupied and reserve them for
future writing. Hence, until Windows decide to write a new data at the same
location of deleted files, those files are theoretically still exists in hard
disk.

If you want to recover deleted file from harddisk, simply scan through all
unoccupied areas in your harddisk and try to find data that match the profile
of file that youA're looking for. When you find them, write those data into a
new file. This is how an undelete program works.

So, what should I do if I want to remove file immediately (permanently) from
my hard disk? ThatA's easy, all you have to do is force Windows to write a new
data at the same location of the file that you want to delete. This is how a
secure delete program works. Currently, there are several algorithms that can
be used for securely overwrite deleted files.

TweakNow SecureDelete supports two of the most common used algorithms: Gutmann
and DOD 5220.22M. As addition the program also support overwriting deleted
files using series of random character multiple times. This method might be
less secure, but faster than the other two methods and still safer than
standard Windows delete method.
