**Publisher's Description**  
  

Disk Cleaner is a tool to quickly and easily free disk space that is used by
temporary files like the system temporary folder, the Internet Explorer Cache
and Cookies folder, and the Recycle Bin. It can be expanded with simple text-
based plug-ins.

Disk Cleaner is very easy to use: select the items you would like to clean,
press the clean button, and youA're done! Despite the ease of use, the
extendability by plug-ins, either full-featured DLLs or just simple text
files, make that Disk Cleaner can also be used by power users to clean
specific items. All that is needed to create a simple plug-in is a text
editor, such as notepad.

**Features:**

  * Fast cleaning of hard disk 
  * Simple user interface 
  * Expandable with simple text files 
  * Portable (runs from USB drive) 
  * Runs without user interface as well (quiet mode)
