**Publisher's Description**  
  

Msconfig (Microsoft System Configuration Utility) is a small tool included
with most Windows Operating Systems which allows you to enable or disable
auto-start Programs and Services. When you type Msconfig into the Run box it
opens the program allowing you to stop unnecessary programs from always
starting with Windows.

However, it does not allow you to completely remove an entry from the list. It
only removes the check from the box leaving a useless entry in your Registry.
This is where MsConfig Cleanup Utility can help. It scans the startup
configurations and allows you remove any or all items that have been
previously disabled using the Msconfig tool.
