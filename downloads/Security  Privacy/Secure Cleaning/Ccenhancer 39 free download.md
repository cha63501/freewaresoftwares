**Publisher's Description**  
  

CCleaner Enhancer is a small tool which adds support for over 1,000 new
programs into the popular program CCleaner. The tool uses the WinApp2.ini
system built into CCleaner to easily add new rules and definitions for
programs. The rules were sourced mainly from the Piriform Support Forum, with
several sourced from other places around the internet.

**Instructions:**  
The actual file containing the definitions is not included with the program,
but is instead downloaded by the program. Simply press ADownload LatestA and
the tool will automatically download the most recent version of the
definitions. If CCEnhancer cannot locate the CCleaner.exe file you can open a
dialog box and select the page yourself.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
