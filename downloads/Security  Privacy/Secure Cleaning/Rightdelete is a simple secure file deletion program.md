**Publisher's Description**  
  


RightDelete 3 adds additional options to an application that has proved to be a popular download. 

It is a simple but potentially very powerful secure file deletion application that uses the US DoD 5220 compliant seven pass method. That is, overwriting the file content with $00, $ff, $00, $ff, $00, $ff, random(256). At each overwrite, buffers are flushed to disk. 

In addition, the file is renamed at the start of the process and before final deletion using random file names. At the end of this process the file is then actually deleted from the disk. 

It is used from the Explorer context menu or by dropping files onto or copying files and pasting them to a desktop shortcut link.
