**Publisher's Description**  
  


Overwrites all free space to cover old file data. Verifies operation of all disk space. 

This program will create a file named ~temp.tmp and start writing to it, and will continue until all of your free space has been overwritten. It tests all those upper locations on your HD that you probably have never written to. 

When you have a 200GB drive and you have 140GB used, that is not the time to find out you can not write more than 148GB. Test it out with this program. 

It can be left running while you are doing other things, and when it runs into the end of your drive, it will erase the temp file and release all that clean memory that now has nothing but billions of the character U. 

**WhatA's New in version 3.2:**

  * Allows you to specify fill data and more.
