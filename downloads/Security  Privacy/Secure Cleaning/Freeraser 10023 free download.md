**Publisher's Description**  
  

An ordinary deleting of files isnA't enough! When you wish to delete any
sensitive information, like industrial secrets or some unwanted content, you
want to be sure that it will be deleted permanently. Sorry to say, there is a
plenty of software recovery tools that can restore your deleted items. If you
need to destroy any data and eliminate any possibility of its restoration you
need a "shredder". This software destroys the data you choose before the
deletion, using a complicated procedure of filling the actual content with
random data.

**Freeraser can function on three levels:**

  * a fast destruction (standard 1-round filling of random data) 
  * a forced destruction (3 rounds of filling according to DoD 5220.22M standard) 
  * an ultimate destruction (35 rounds of filling with data according to Guttman algorithm).
