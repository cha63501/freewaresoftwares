The Blocklist Manager has the ability to import from custom sources also. Along with this, it has a built in Inclusions/Exclusions manager. With these, you can define custom IPAs and ranged to be included or excluded from the list. This can be useful if there is a web site that is blocked and you want it unblocked you can just add the IP address of the website to the Exclusions manager.

Another special feature in the Blocklist Manager is the Whois Project that allows a user to lookup IP addresses. The Whois Project was made by The Faimous One and Seraphielx to stop the confusion of having to know which IP addresses are listed on which whois servers. It will select the proper server and look up the IP for you.
