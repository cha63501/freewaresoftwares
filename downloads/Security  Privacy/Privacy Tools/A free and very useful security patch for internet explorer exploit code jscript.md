**Publisher's Description**  
  


eEye Digital Security is advising customers to the existence of exploit code that targets a critical security vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer. The exploit pertains to an unpatched vulnerability that has been released on various public mailing lists. 

This issue affects any Windows operating system running Internet Explorer versions 5.01 SP4 through 6.0 SP1. The vulnerability results from the method in which Internet Explorer handles HTML Objects. This flaw allows for remote code to be executed on the target system. If successfully exploited, an attacker will only have the rights of the currently logged on user. System Administrators should be careful to not use Administrator accounts for general system use.

Currently, there have been numerous reports of this vulnerability being used on various websites in attempts to install Spyware and remote control "bot" software for use in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The recommended action required to protect systems against this attack is to disable Active Scripting from within Internet Explorer.

eEye Digital SecurityA's Research Team has confirmed that eEyeAs Blink host-based intrusion prevention solution protects from the exploitation of this Internet Explorer flaw without requiring invasive firewalling, or the presence of any patch. Current Blink customers should ensure that the Application Protection is enabled in their Blink policies.

Additionally, eEye Digital SecurityAs Research Team has released a workaround for the vulnerability as a temporary measure for customers who have not yet installed Blink. eEyeAs Temporary Workaround is a free and very useful security patch for Internet Explorer. This workaround is not meant to replace the forthcoming Microsoft patch, rather it is intended as a temporary protection against this flaw. Organizations should only install this patch if they are not able to disable Active Scripting as a means of mitigation.

**Requirements**: This patch only supports Internet Explorer 5.01 through 6.0 on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003
