**Publisher's Description**  
  

Each time that you type a URL in the address bar or click on a link in
Internet Explorer browser, the URL address is automatically added to the
history index file. When you type a sequence of characters in the address bar,
Internet Explorer automatically suggests you all URLs that begins with
characters sequence that you typed (unless AutoComplete feature for Web
addresses is turned off). However, Internet Explorer doesnA't allow you to
view and edit the entire URL list that it stores inside the history file.

This utility reads all information from the history file on your computer, and
displays the list of all URLs that you have visited in the last few days. It
also allows you to select one or more URL addresses, and then remove them from
the history file or save them into text, HTML or XML file. In addition, you
are allowed to view the visited URL list of other user profiles on your
computer, and even access the visited URL list on a remote computer, as long
as you have permission to access the history folder.

**What's New in version 1.70:**

  * Added 'File Position' column, which displays the position of the record inside the index.dat file.
