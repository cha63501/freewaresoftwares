**Publisher's Description**  
  

Kidz Protection is software designed specifically for parents (beginners or
seasoned computer users). It allows easy management of software used to
communicate on the Internet.

With just a few clicks, it will let you decide if you authorize your child or
teenager to access Internet programs such as:

  * Conventional Internet browsers 
  * e-mail software 
  * Chat software 
  * File exchange (P2P) 

Every software program carries some kind of risk. You may decide to block or
authorize access to over 60 of the most popular software programs knowing full
well that you can always count on KIDZ CD to deliver everything that your
child or teenager needs to browse the Internet in a totally secure
environment.

A timer within the Kidz Protection program allows access to other software
programs for a limited time if you wish. This function is ideal whenever a
parent is around to supervise the use of these programs.

**Note:** The default username and password is: "kidzcd". Once you log in, you have the option to change the username and password.
