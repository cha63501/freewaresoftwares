**Publisher's Description**  
  

Based on the same technology used in the VPS LiveShield product, Determina has
engineered a standalone fix that provides free and immediate protection to
users worldwide that need to protect systems from related attacks until such
time as Microsoft issues its own patch. Note that current Determina VPS
customers do not have to apply this patch as they have been protected against
this attack without the need for any update.

The source code of the Shield is included in the download for review by any
independent security expert.

Determina Fix is a free and useful runtime fix for the IE createTextRange()
vulnerability. It can be applied to Windows 2000, XP and 2003 systems running
Internet Explorer 5.01 and 6.0. The vulnerability lies in the MSHTML.DLL
rendering engine which is loaded into many applications for HTML rendering,
including but not limited to Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office.

The installation of the fix consists of adding the fix DLL to the AppInit_DLLs
registry key in:

HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWindows

The MSI installer will do this automatically. This will enable loading this
fix DLL into all the vulnerable applications. The fix does not modify any file
or application on the disk. It will only modify the vulnerable applications
and DLLs in memory. The fix will not be applied to any processes that are
running at the time of the installation. To enable the patch, you have to
restart IE, Outlook and any other process that need to be protected. After the
installation, run status.exe to verify that your system is protected. If you
have a version of MSHTML.DLL that the patch does not support, status.exe will
report that the protection is not active.

Once Microsoft releases an official patch and it is installed by the user, the
Determina Shield will not be applied any more. Determina recommends
uninstalling this fix even though keeping it active will not affect the
system. To uninstall the fix, use AAdd Remove ProgramsA in the Control Panel.
To uninstall it manually, remove the DLL from the AppInit_DLLs key and restart
your machine. You can then safely delete the DLL.

This tool requires administrative privileges on the vulnerable machines in
order to install the fix.

**Requirements**: Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0
