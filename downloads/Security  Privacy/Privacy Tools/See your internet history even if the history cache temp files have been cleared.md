Interested in knowing what websites are visited on your computer? Now you donA't have to guess! Data Fortress Inc. has created a wonderful utility called IE History Tracker. So, even if a person clears the cache, deletes temporary internet files or clears the history, every site visited using the Internet Explorer Browser can be revealed.

How is it possible to display this information? The answer is simple. Our program opens and reads a file called Index.dat. Index.dat is located on every computer that utilizes Internet Explorer and maintains a detailed log of all sites visited using the Internet Explorer Browser.
