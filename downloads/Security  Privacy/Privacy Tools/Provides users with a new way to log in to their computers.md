**Publisher's Description**  
  


Picword is an easy to use tool that provides users with a new way to log in to their computers. Rather than using a password in the traditional sense, Picword locks and unlocks your screen by using targets on selected pictures. 

Targets can be a single click target, a long click target, a line target, or a combination of targets. This may sound confusing, however, the interface is quite intuitive and easy to use. Additionally, if you forget your target or target combination, you can use a custom pin to access your computer. 

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com).
