**Publisher's Description**  
  

fsLock is a simple program that protects your most important files by locking
them in a list. Once locked, these files will be protected against being
renamed, deleted, modified, moved, etc. Any number of files can be protected
(except executables (EXE) and Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and different lists
of files can be used and easily switched between.

Drag and Drop support for the list is also available if you find files in
explorer you want to protect as well. Start with Windows support is included
and the ability to start the engine on start-up. fsLock also supports full
logging support.

fsLock also supports secure file deleting via the ADelete FilesA section of
the window. IN this section, you are able to move directly from the ASecure
FilesA list and completely wipe the files clean (if the engine is not
running).

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).

**What's New in version 2.0:**

  * Updated all menu icons to new 24 bit, Windows Vista style designs.

  * All sections now have their own specific icons assigned to them. 
  * Lots of small tweaks.
