Privacy Mantra keeps your computer clean from online and offline tracks. Most
people are unaware of that every web site they have visited remains in the
undeletable index.dat file, even after the Internet history and cache has been
removed. Your system is also keeping information of executables you run,
movies you watch and documents you open. Some of these prints canA't be
deleted manually as they are locked by the system.

Privacy Mantra will erase and wash away most privacy threats in your machine
including, Internet history, cache, cookies, index.dat files, auto-complete
forms, search assistant, recent documents, open/save dialogs, run files,
Mozilla Firefox, Google Toolbar and more. Privacy Mantra allows the user to
easily download the latest database of threats. This reliable cleaner will not
only protect your privacy but also free disk space by deleting junk files. For
maximum flexibility you can also create your own cleaning plugins and download
others.
