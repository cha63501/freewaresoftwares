**Publisher's Description**  
  


When you visit a website, your browser may be instructed to visit other third-party domains without your knowledge. Some of these third-party domains raise security, privacy and safety concerns. 

The Strider URL Tracer is a tool that reveals these third-party domains and it includes a Typo-Patrol feature that generates and scans sites that capitalize on inadvertent URL misspellings, a process known as typo-squatting.

The tool also enables parents to block typo-squatting domains that serve adult ads on typos of childrenA's Web sites. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
