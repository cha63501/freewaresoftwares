**Publisher's Description**  
  

SaferSpace is a very simple program that will keep your children from
accessing the popular MySpace website where online predators have been found
to be lurking in the shadows.

SaferSpace keeps a close eye on your computer and whenever a user tries to
access the MySpace website SaferSpace will immediately deny access to the
MySpace website.

Optional features include the ability to keep a log of each time someone tries
to access the MySpace website and SaferSpace can notify the user when access
to MySpace is denied. You can select to block MySpace for all users of your
computer or just for certain users.

SaferSpace requires administrator privileges to be installed and configured.
