Bandwidth Management and Firewall will allow to limit bandwidth for a computer

some network service.

In this case computer or service with limited bandwidth can not exceed
assigned limit. Bandwidth limitation is possible to set by header fields of
protocols: Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP.

TCP protocol inspection drops harmful TCP packets. In firewall can be set
