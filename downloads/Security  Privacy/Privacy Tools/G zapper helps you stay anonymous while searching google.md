**Publisher's Description**  
  


G-Zapper will help you to remain anonymous while searching Google. 

Did you know that Google stores a unique identifier in a cookie on your PC, which allows them to track the keywords you search for? They use this information to compile reports, track user habits, and test features. In the future, it is possible they could even sell this information or share it with others.

G-Zapper helps you protect your identity and this valuable "attention data" by blocking the Google search cookie. To delete your Google search cookie and create a new one, to obscure your identity, click the Delete Cookie button. To completely block the Google search cookie for good, click the Block Cookie button. Then test the results.

What you search for should be yours and yours alone. By clearing the Google search cookie regularly or blocking it all-together, you will help protect your attention data from others. G-Zapper makes this a breeze!
