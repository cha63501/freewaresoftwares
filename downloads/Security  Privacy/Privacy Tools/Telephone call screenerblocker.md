**Publisher's Description**  
  


Call Screener is a software application that blocks unwanted phone calls. It requires a dial-up modem that has voice and caller ID capability to be installed on your computer. (Call Screener uses only the voice and caller ID features of the modem -- there is no need to "dial-up" anywhere.) When a call is blocked, Call Screener speaks the message contained in the ZapMessage.wav file to the caller. An example ZapMessage.wav file is included in the kit that comes in the download. Also, if you block anonymous calls, Call Screener plays an anonymous caller rejection message that instructs the caller how to remove their call blocking. Documentation is also included in the kit. 

Added for version 2 is the ability to have a different "call blocked" message for each phone number that is to be blocked.

Modems that IA've tried and have worked well under 64-bit Windows 7 are the HiRO H50113 USB external modem, and the HiRO H50006 and Rosewill RNX-56AG PCI internal modems. I think the TRENDnet TFM-560U USB external modem may also work, but since I havenA't actually tried one, I canA't vouch for it. IA've included drivers in the kit that support both caller ID and voice for the HiRO H50113.

Call Screener W7 version 2 runs under either 64-bit or 32-bit Windows 7.
