**Publisher's Description**  
  


SaferSpace is a very simple program that will keep your children from accessing the popular MySpace website where online predators have been found to be lurking in the shadows. 

SaferSpace keeps a close eye on your computer and whenever a user tries to access the MySpace website SaferSpace will immediately deny access to the MySpace website.

Optional features include the ability to keep a log of each time someone tries to access the MySpace website and SaferSpace can notify the user when access to MySpace is denied. You can select to block MySpace for all users of your computer or just for certain users.

SaferSpace requires administrator privileges to be installed and configured.
