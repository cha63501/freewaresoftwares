**Publisher's Description**  
  

TotalRecall is a free forensic analysis tool to reconstruct Internet Explorer
and userA's activity on the computer.

Almost every computer user is familiar with a Web browser, such as Internet
Explorer.

This Web browser holds the history files of the Web Sites (or Uniform Resource
Locators - URLs) visited by users of this system. Usually the user does not
know about its existence. Because browser history files are in binary form,
special tools are required to read them.

**TotalRecall investigates: **

  * MS Internet Explorer activity 
  * MS Internet Explorer history 
  * MS Internet Explorer cookie 
  * MS Internet Explorer favorites 
  * Recent files and folders 
  * Not erased temporary files 

Total Recall is also available for Windows 98/ME/2000. [Download Total Recall
