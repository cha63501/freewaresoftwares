GatherProxy is a free tool that harvests thousands of proxy servers from over 200 websites. Once youA've obtained the list of proxies, users can check the proxies to see if they are available. To select a proxy to use, simply right click the proxy server and set it for Firefox, IE, or Google Chrome. 

The slick interface allows you to filter proxies based on several criteria such as elite, anonymous, country, transparent, and more. 

GatherProxy, by default, gets its list from the developerA's server, however, users can also create their own list of proxies.

The program does not require installation. Simply extract the archive and run the executable.

**Note:** While checking proxy servers, some sites may be malicious and trigger your Antivirus program.
