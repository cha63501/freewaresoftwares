**Publisher's Description**  
  

Scripts, links, email addresses, objects, applets and more are displayed and
logged. WebHogs evaluates web pages and rates them with a Pig Score. "WebHogs
is the internet tool that could," Maj. Hog said. "See your favorite web pages
or your own pages as a hacker might see them."

Web pages may "invade" your computer and privacy. Like a malicious virus, a
web page may track your movements, download and run programs, and alter your
computer without telling you. Maj. Hog says, "Catch them and pen them up."

Web Hogs are the web pages with the highest Pig Scores. WebHogs produces Pig
Scores for indiviual web pages, a list of sites in an input file, or will go
out and find them all by itself ("deep surf troll").

WebHogs tallies Pig Score points by scanning content for WARNINGS, ALERTS and
DANGER related to loss of privacy, use of your system resources (without
permission?) and possible corruption of your computer system (suspicious
elements). WARNINGS include cookies and tracking your mouse movements, etc.
ALERTS include running scripts, using Java code, defining functions, creating
documents, invoking object classes, use of ActiveX, running applets, etc.
DANGER includes non-text/html content, downloading programs, malicious URLs,
etc.

EXTRA Any reference to Osama Bin Laden or Al Qaeda will be reported and
logged! EXTRA Flag pages with your customized search item. EXTRA WebHogs is a
script, link and email address troller and grabber.

The latest release features a Search Box for user-customization of searches.

Note: The download link provided redirects to the developerA's website. You
