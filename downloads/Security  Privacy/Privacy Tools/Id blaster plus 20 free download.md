**Publisher's Description**  
  

ID-Blaster Plus will destroy tracking tactics by randomizing GUID/Unique ID
numbers found on your PC.

In Windows, many applications have something called a "product ID number", a
"GUID" or a "Unique ID number". This number may be the same throughout
Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player - even the operating system itself.
Since this number nevers changes, it would be the PERFECT way a malicious
person or even an advertising company could track your habits - perhaps
through a malicious website ActiveX control, or Java applet.

Why not just delete it?  
In this case, you would have a constant ID of nothing - and given the small
number of people that might also have that "null" value, it could still be
used to track you.

ID-Blaster Plus works by changing these ID numbers frequently, destroying
tracking tactics using these numbers. ID-Blaster can run from the system tray,
using very little resources, and constantly protect you in the background.
