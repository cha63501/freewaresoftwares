**Publisher's Description**  
  


Loki Network Project is an opportunity to protect your private data (IP address, e-mail/FTP/HTTP passwords, web-sites visited, uploaded/downloaded files and etc...) and bypass certain Internet access limitations you may have at your location. An example, Loki Network allows you: 

  * Protect your data from being intercepted by various network sniffers in your LAN segment 
  * Safely bypass traffic interception and analyses on corporate, ISP or even country level firewall 
  * Bypass any limitations in visiting web-sites or any other Internet services (if access to Loki Network servers is not blocked directly). 

An example, if youA're using Internet from your workplace to visit any entertaining sites you may feel safe because your network administrator wonAt see more than encrypted HTTPS (by default Loki Network client tunnels through TCP port 443 which is typically opened in most of firewall configurations) connection to one of the Loki Network servers and he wonAt be able to report you. You also get complete access to the entire Internet even if corporate firewall is configured to block access to some certain services or web-sites.

Loki Network allows you to surf the Internet anonymously and hides your real location (IP address). Everything you do through the Loki Network is done from the name of the Loki Network server and from its IP address. Connection between your computer and Loki Network is secured with SSL. However, to protect your anonymity you still have to be careful about any data you fill in web forms and network applications you use locally (any locally running application still have the complete access to your real IP address).

**Features:**

  * Easy to install. Just download Loki Network Client from this site and you can use service as Guest user (password: A'GuestA'). 
  * Easy-to-use interface to create your own security profile. 
  * Flexible engine to avoid problems with local and external traffic by detailed analysis of your network configuration. 
  * Allow customization of security and quality of service as needed for specific applications and network services.
