everything that is going on and, according to your choices, modifies headers
and html page content on-the-fly to make things right. You donA't want pop-ups
and banners? Just activate the corresponding filters and they will disappear.
You want cookies to be deleted when you close your browser? Proximodo will do
it for you.
