  * and more to come... 
The Blocklist Manager can simplify and automate many tasks for you. The

It also includes a built in converter that allows you to convert to and from
various formats. Some of these formats are listed below:

The Blocklist Manager has the ability to import from custom sources also.
Along with this, it has a built in Inclusions/Exclusions manager. With these,
you can define custom IPAs and ranged to be included or excluded from the
list. This can be useful if there is a web site that is blocked and you want
it unblocked you can just add the IP address of the website to the Exclusions
manager.

Another special feature in the Blocklist Manager is the Whois Project that
allows a user to lookup IP addresses. The Whois Project was made by The
Faimous One and Seraphielx to stop the confusion of having to know which IP
addresses are listed on which whois servers. It will select the proper server
and look up the IP for you.
