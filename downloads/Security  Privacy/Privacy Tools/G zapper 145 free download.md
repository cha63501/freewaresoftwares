**Publisher's Description**  
  

G-Zapper will help you to remain anonymous while searching Google.

Did you know that Google stores a unique identifier in a cookie on your PC,
which allows them to track the keywords you search for? They use this
information to compile reports, track user habits, and test features. In the
future, it is possible they could even sell this information or share it with
others.

G-Zapper helps you protect your identity and this valuable "attention data" by
blocking the Google search cookie. To delete your Google search cookie and
create a new one, to obscure your identity, click the Delete Cookie button. To
completely block the Google search cookie for good, click the Block Cookie
button. Then test the results.

What you search for should be yours and yours alone. By clearing the Google
search cookie regularly or blocking it all-together, you will help protect
your attention data from others. G-Zapper makes this a breeze!
