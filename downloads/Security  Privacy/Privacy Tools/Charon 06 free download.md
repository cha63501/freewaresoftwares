**Publisher's Description**  
  

Charon is a multipurpose proxy program. Charon will search google for
publically posted proxy lists and incorporate an environmental checker to
verify the anonymity / functionality of these. Filtering support is added by
means of user-customisable lists to eliminate proxies such as those run by
educational / military / government authorities.
