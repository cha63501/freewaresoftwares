**Publisher's Description**  
  

Creates a random password into your clipboard for pasting. DonA't go online to
a web site that generates random passwords. How can this be any less secure.
Someone has your password and IP!

It can be configured to create passwords with a length of 6-72 characters (in
3 character steps. ie: 6.9.12.15...72). Every password will have 1/3 Lower
case, 1/3 Upper case, and 1/3 numbers. No funny characters, just Caps,
Lowercase and Numbers. Random in placement in the string and random values.

The program self terminates, and you can even configure it for a quick mode
where you will not even see it come up. You click on the exe or a shortcut to
the exe and boom, you got a password in the clipboard, all ready to paste.
