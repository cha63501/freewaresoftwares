**Publisher's Description**  
  

FTPPasswordSniffer is the universal FTP password recovery tool for any of your
favorite FTP application such as FileZilla, SmartFtp, etc. It can not only
recover the lost FTP account password but also can sniff and catch any of the
FTP account passwords passing through your network, thus making it a great
tool for penetration testers.

Each FTP application uses its own storage and encryption mechanism for keeping
the FTP server password information. Often it happens that you configure the
FTP accounts in the beginning and then forget the passwords as it is taken
care by your FTP application. At later times when you need these FTP account
passwords you realize that you cannot just get it because either the password
is stored at some secret location or it is encrypted. In such a situation
FTPPasswordSniffer comes to your rescue by helping you to easily and instantly
recover those lost FTP account passwords.

FTPPasswordSniffer is very simple to use with its interactive GUI application.
Initially you have to launch FTPPasswordSniffer and click on A'Start FTP
RecoveryA' to start the operation. Then launch your FTP application and
connect to the FTP server whose password you want to recover. While
authentication is in progress, FTPPasswordSniffer will transparently catch FTP
login packets flowing through the wire and instantly get you the right
username & password in clear text for that FTP server.

FTPPasswordSniffer comes with Installer which will help you to install it
locally with all the dependent softwares. It works on most of the Windows
platforms starting from Windows XP to latest operating system, Windows 7.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes a toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.
