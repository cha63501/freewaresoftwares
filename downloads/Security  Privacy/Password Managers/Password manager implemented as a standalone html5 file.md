**Publisher's Description**  
  


EveryPass is a HTML5 based password manager that allows cross domain password management on modern, web enabled devices (computers, tablets, phones). EveryPass is not a service, it is a standalone, self contained application that uses the browser as a runtime environment and runs offline. 

User data is secured with AES 256 encryption and saved to the local file system of a host device as a HTML5 file. The resulting single file is fully self contained (application and data) and portable across devices and operating systems (Windows, Linux, OS X, Android).
