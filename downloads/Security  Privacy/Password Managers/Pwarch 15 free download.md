**Publisher's Description**  
  

pwArch is a Password Archive. It gives you a place to save your password
information. Store your passwords by site with user and password. All you have
to remember is the password into your archive, then you have access to all of
the password data you need. Simple to use. All data is stored in an encrypted
.zip file, so it is safe even if someone gets the data file itself.

A flexible password generator is also included. You can create passwords based
on desired length, selectable characters, or you can define a template for the
generator to use.

pwArch is freeware and source code is also available for download if desired.
