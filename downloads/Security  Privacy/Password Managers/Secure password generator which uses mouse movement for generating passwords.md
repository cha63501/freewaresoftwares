**Publisher's Description**  
  


XPassGen is a password generator designed to generate large numbers of passwords securely. It does this by using mouse movement to generate passwords instead of computer generated data. The advantage of using user input is the result is 100% random and impossible to predict. 

There are four default character sets to choose from, including an extra to exclude similar looking characters. You can also define your own custom sets of characters to include or exclude.
