GooglePasswordDecryptor is the free tool to recover stored Google account passwords by various applications. Most of the GoogleA's desktop applications such as GTalk, Picassa etc store the account passwords in their private encrypted store to prevent hassale of entering the password everytime. GooglePasswordDecryptor goes through each of these applicationA's encrypted stores and decrypts this Google account password. 

Google uses the single centralized account for managing all of its services such as Gmail, Picassa, GTalk, iGoogle, Desktop Search etc. Since all of these core services are controlled by one account, losing the password will easily make oneA's life miserable. Also trying the Google password recovery service will turn out to be useless unless you have setup the secondary account for receiving the password and you remember all the personal details that you have entered at the time of account creation.

In such cases, GooglePasswordDecryptor comes to rescue and helps in recovering the stored Google password by various applications. Also it can show passwords from multiple accounts if you have used more than one Google account.
