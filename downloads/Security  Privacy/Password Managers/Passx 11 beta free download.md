**Publisher's Description**  
  

PassX is a simple tool that will allow you to generate completely secure
passwords for Windows. You can either create passwords randomly (being any
size, include special characters, force stop certain characters, etc), build a
password from a string (a sentence, or names, or anything you want) or build a
password generated from a list of words that you have specified (which can be
customised for how they are used).

All settings created can be saved and re-used later to create more passwords
and the passwords generated can be saved to a TXT file. You can create any
number of passwords you wish and they can be used on other operating systems
other than Windows (Linux, MAC-OS, etc).
