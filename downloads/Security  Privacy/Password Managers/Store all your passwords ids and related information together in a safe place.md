**Publisher's Description**  
  


Any Password is an easy-to-use tool that lets you store and arrange all your passwords, user IDs, and related information in a tree form. The program saves this information in encrypted files which can be protected by a password. So, the only thing you need to remember is the password for the file. Any Password can also generate random passwords with specified parameters (length, used characters, etc.). You can find any stored information using the incremental search feature.
