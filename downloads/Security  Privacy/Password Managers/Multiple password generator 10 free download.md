**Publisher's Description**  
  

The purpose of this free program is to generate up to six secure passwords
(for things such as email accounts, social network accounts etc) using just a
single easy to remember password (the master password). So it is good if you
simply want to remember one easy password for different accounts (of various
sorts) you may have. Once you have typed in your master password simply press
generate to generate the other six passwords. It is suggested to make the
master password a memorable secret that only you know the answer to.

This program uses a combination of cryptographic methods to generate secure
passwords. Program works with Windows 7 in XP compatability mode.
