**Publisher's Description**  
  

Store and manage your passwords in a secure and convenient way.

SismaA is an easy-to-use password manager that allows you to store and manage
your passwords in a secure and convenient way.

SismaA keeps your accounts details and passwords in a secure database that is
encrypted with strong 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, Rijndael)
cipher. SismaA includes a strong random password generator which can generate
alphanumeric or pronounceable passwords.

SismaA promotes password management best practices by warning you when a weak
password is chosen or when a password is reused across accounts. SismaA allows
you to specify expiration time for passwords and reminds you to change them
when they expire. SismaA employs advanced clipboard clearance mechanisms to
minimize the risk of passwords left in the clipboard after you have used them.

SismaA is FREE for personal use.
