**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is a simple program to generate so called "Un guessable Password" for you. Now you donA't need to think "What password I must have for this and that". GPW doesnA't keep your passwords. So you have to write down somewhere to keep them for yourself. Because the password you generate is "Un guessable", it is very hard to reconstruct if you forget it. He he.. :) 

**Features:**

  * You can choose with number or without number 
  * You can choose only uppercase letters or mixed with lowercase letters 
  * You can choose to include special charactars or without it. (If you choose to use it, only ONE charactar will include) 
  * You are able to choose pass length (3 to 15) 
  * You can copy a generated password to clipboard
