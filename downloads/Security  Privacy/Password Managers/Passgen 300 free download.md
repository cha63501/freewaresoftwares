**Publisher's Description**  
  

Passgen is a simple program that generates passwords. If I recall correctly it
was originally written back in 1998, as an MFC application under Windows. It
has been freely available from ftp.jgaa.com for a decade. Version 3 is a total
re-write. Linux is now my primary operating system, and the motivation for
version 3 was to make passgen available under Linux as well as Windows. This
is achieved by using the wxWidgets X-platform library (see www.wxwidgets.org).

The target-audience for passgen is pretty much everyone that use a computer.
It is well suited for anything from novise home users to senior IT
professionals.

The main difference between my passgen and other (newer) packages of the same
name under Linux, is that (my) passgen has a graphical user interface (GUI).
That is convenient under Gnome, KDE and also under good old Microsoft Windows.

PassGen for Linux is [available
here](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=250140).
