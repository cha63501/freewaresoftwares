**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bytessence PasswordManager is a free / open source personal information
management tool, created from the need of remembering data like logins and
passwords for different websites. While many internet services use such
logins, the quantity of passwords the users need to remember grows
dramatically, reaching a point where they will write them on paper or simple
text files, making them a potential victim of data theft.

BPM was designed to be light, small and easy to use. It also features active
protection capabilities like a configurable boss key (hides BPM from the
screen completely or restores it), automatic clipboard clearing (after a
number of seconds the clipboard is cleared to get rid of any sensitive
information), automatic close of open containers (useful in case you leave
your PC unprotected) and automatic backup when saving files. BPM can also be
extended with plugins in the form of tools (virtual keyboard to avoid your
keystrokes to be intercepted by hardware keyloggers, password analyzer and
generator), importers and exporters. Best of all, BPM is open source so you
can have a look under the hood and even help us fix bugs, send suggestions for
future versions, etc.
