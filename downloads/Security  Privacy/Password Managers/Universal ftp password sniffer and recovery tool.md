**Publisher's Description**  
  


FTPPasswordSniffer is the universal FTP password recovery tool for any of your favorite FTP application such as FileZilla, SmartFtp, etc. It can not only recover the lost FTP account password but also can sniff and catch any of the FTP account passwords passing through your network, thus making it a great tool for penetration testers. 

Each FTP application uses its own storage and encryption mechanism for keeping the FTP server password information. Often it happens that you configure the FTP accounts in the beginning and then forget the passwords as it is taken care by your FTP application. At later times when you need these FTP account passwords you realize that you cannot just get it because either the password is stored at some secret location or it is encrypted. In such a situation FTPPasswordSniffer comes to your rescue by helping you to easily and instantly recover those lost FTP account passwords.

FTPPasswordSniffer is very simple to use with its interactive GUI application. Initially you have to launch FTPPasswordSniffer and click on A'Start FTP RecoveryA' to start the operation. Then launch your FTP application and connect to the FTP server whose password you want to recover. While authentication is in progress, FTPPasswordSniffer will transparently catch FTP login packets flowing through the wire and instantly get you the right username & password in clear text for that FTP server.

FTPPasswordSniffer comes with Installer which will help you to install it locally with all the dependent softwares. It works on most of the Windows platforms starting from Windows XP to latest operating system, Windows 7.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes a toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.
