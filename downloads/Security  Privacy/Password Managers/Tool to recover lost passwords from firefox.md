**Publisher's Description**  
  


FirePasswordViewer is the GUI version of popular FirePassword tool designed to decrypt sign-on secrets stored by Firefox. Firefox records the login details such as username and password for every website authorized by the user and stores them in the sign-on database file in encrypted format. 

FirePasswordViewer tool can decrypt and display these secrets on the same lines as the Firefox built-in password manager. The main advantage of FirePasswordViewer is that it does not require Firefox to be running. This is very useful in recovering the sign-on details when Firefox fails to function properly. 

Also FirePasswordViewer can be used to display sign-on secrets from different profile (other than current profile) as well as from the different operating system (such as Linux, Mac etc) altogether. This greatly helps forensic investigators who can copy the relevant files from the target system to test machine and view the credentials offline without affecting the target environment. The displayed sign-on information can then be saved to a file in standard HTML format which can be used as valuable and quick offline reference.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes 3rd party software which does not have to be installed to use the software.
