A program to safely store your passwords and PINs. With only one password you get access to the crypted data (BLOWFISH 256 bit). 

The following entry types are available:

  * Simple text 
  * Username/Password with comment 
  * Files (for example pictures) 
  * Tables 
These entries can be stored in folders and subfolders. Cut/Copy/Paste of these entries is possible. Password files can be converted to an executable file, which can be ported on USB-stick or other moveable drives without the need to install this program.
