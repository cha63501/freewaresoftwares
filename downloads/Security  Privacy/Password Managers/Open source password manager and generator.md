**Publisher's Description**  
  


Subrosa is small program which can help users to save passwords in a file so that it wonA't get lost. It also allows to generate passwords using random characters. I have implemented Blowfish encryption algorithm so that users can keep the passwords safe in a file. 

Other than passwords, it can also be used to store gift codes, iTunes codes or any other codes. You can put a remark to a password too.
