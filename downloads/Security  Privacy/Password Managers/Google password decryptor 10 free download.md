**Publisher's Description**  
  

GooglePasswordDecryptor is the free tool to recover stored Google account
passwords by various applications. Most of the GoogleA's desktop applications
such as GTalk, Picassa etc store the account passwords in their private
encrypted store to prevent hassale of entering the password everytime.
GooglePasswordDecryptor goes through each of these applicationA's encrypted
stores and decrypts this Google account password.

Google uses the single centralized account for managing all of its services
such as Gmail, Picassa, GTalk, iGoogle, Desktop Search etc. Since all of these
core services are controlled by one account, losing the password will easily
make oneA's life miserable. Also trying the Google password recovery service
will turn out to be useless unless you have setup the secondary account for
receiving the password and you remember all the personal details that you have
entered at the time of account creation.

In such cases, GooglePasswordDecryptor comes to rescue and helps in recovering
the stored Google password by various applications. Also it can show passwords
from multiple accounts if you have used more than one Google account.

GooglePasswordDecryptor supports recovering of the stored encrypted password
from most of the prominent Google desktop applications as well as internet
browsers. Here is the complete list of supported applications.

  * Google Talk 
  * Google Picassa 
  * Google Desktop Seach 
  * Gmail Notifier 
  * Internet Explorer (all versions from 4 to 8) 
  * Google Chrome 
It also provides A'Export FeatureA' to save the recovered Google passwords to
HTML or TEXT format for future use.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes a toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.
