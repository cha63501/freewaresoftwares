iPassword Generator is a free, lightweight and portable Windows application designed to create a strong and unique password for each of your applications or online accounts from the keyfile you selected using a technology called Tabula recta. In addition, you are allowed to encrypt and hide your keyfile inside any other file with the AES-256( Advanced Encryption Standard ) algorithm. 

The main difference between iPassword Generator and other password creators is that, the passwords created by it looks like random strings, but theyA're not. The passwords can be and can only be recreated if you selected the correct keyfile and entered the correct password if itA's encrypted, but if you lost the keyfile, no one can retrieve the passwords back.
