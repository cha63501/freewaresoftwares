**Publisher's Description**  
  

Hushkey is a simple password manager for Windows that securely stores your
passwords on your computer. It uses a secure encryption algorithm developed by
Inniosoft.

Hushkey is also computer dependant. That means that you can use the
application executable on any computer, but you cannot view a password
database on a computer other than the one on which it was created.

In the final build, we will create a function that will let you export the
database. Once moved, it cannot be moved again.

Hushkey is intended for general home/office internet users.

**Features to come in Beta 2:**

  * AES 256-bit encryption 
  * Brand new user interface.
  * The ability to group your passwords into categories
  * A strong, random password generator that will create passwords that are secure and easy to read.
  * Secure clipboard management. You will be able to send a password to the clipboard, this of which will be deleted from the clipboard after a specified duration.
  * A viewing pane to view the currently selected itemA's information.
  * The ability to import/export a database to CSV.
  * Database copying (for use when moving the database from one computer to another securely).
  * More item information, such as URL and notes.
  * A password searching utility
  * Profile dialog that will allow you to change your master username and password

Hushkey will have a new interface by the time v1.0 comes out. If you have any
interface ideas, please post a comment here. To see the current progress,

Hushkey will soon be verified by an online security company, such as Comodo.
More information on that to come soon.

**Note:** If you wish to host Hushkey on your own website, please send an email to products.hushkey@inniosoft.netii.net. I would like to see where it is going, and if it is from a trusted source - in other words, your website must be verified as "Excellent" by WOT (Web of Trust).
