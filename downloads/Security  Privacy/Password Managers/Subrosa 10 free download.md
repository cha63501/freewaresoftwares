**Publisher's Description**  
  

Subrosa is small program which can help users to save passwords in a file so
that it wonA't get lost. It also allows to generate passwords using random
characters. I have implemented Blowfish encryption algorithm so that users can
keep the passwords safe in a file.

Other than passwords, it can also be used to store gift codes, iTunes codes or
any other codes. You can put a remark to a password too.
