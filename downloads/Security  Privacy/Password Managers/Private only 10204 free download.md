**Publisher's Description**  
  

Those who visit multiple sites that require registration are familiar with the
scenario: sooner or later you will have accumulated a considerable number of
login details. Whether itA's from forums, portals, providers, shops,
messengers, etc. almost every Internet activity is requires registration.

One can write down the registraion information of course, on scraps of paper
or store somewhere on the hard drive. But what if someone gets access to your
data? And how comfortable is this seemingly simple method at all? A digital
password manager makes it much easier to search for data and also to transfer
and assign data. In addition to the ease of use, password managers also
provide security, so that no one else can access confidential data.

All this can make the password manager Private Only very useful for you.
Additionally, Private Only places a very high emphasis on usability.
