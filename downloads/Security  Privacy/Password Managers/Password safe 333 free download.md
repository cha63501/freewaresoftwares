**Publisher's Description**  
  

Whether the answer is one or hundreds, Password Safe allows you to safely and
easily create a secured and encrypted user name/password list. With Password
Safe all you have to do is create and remember a single "Master Password" of
your choice in order to unlock and access your entire user name/password list.

Password Safe allows you to manage your old passwords and to easily and
quickly generate, store, organize, retrieve, and use complex new passwords,
using password policies that you control. Once stored, your user names and
passwords are just a few clicks away.

Using Password Safe you can organize your passwords using your own
customizable referencesAfor example, by user ID, category, web site, or
location. You can choose to store all your passwords in a single encrypted
master password list (an encrypted password database), or use multiple
databases to further organize your passwords (work and home, for example). And
with its intuitive interface you will be up and running in minutes.
