This program idea came after somebody asked us how he could retrieve or
restore his forgotten password in one of our old forums. So, we thought a
program like this would solve most of these common problems. The program is
free for download and use. We are currently looking for BETA testers, so if
you are interested please send us an email at info@logivis-studios.com. Also,
if you are just using the program, please report any bugs you will find, or
any suggestion you think will make the program better.

IMPORTANT: This is a Password manager program but in order to access the
information you have saved, you have to remember the Master username and
Master password of this program. You remember just one username and password
and all the rest are in the programA's database!
