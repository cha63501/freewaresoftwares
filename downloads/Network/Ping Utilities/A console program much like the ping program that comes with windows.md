**Publisher's Description**  
  


Fping is a console program, much like the ping program that comes with windows. Fping has the same options as the regular ping, and several options that are unique: 

  * Time between pings can be adjusted at wish, ranging from 1ms to 5s. 
  * Beep on every (un)successful reply. Use this to test your network status in the background. 
  * Ping multiple hosts with one simple command. 
  * Ping using raw sockets, or use the ICMP dll. The choice is up to you. 

**What's New in version 2.22:**

  * Fix for Win2K for the getaddrinfo() function (since version 2.19)
