**Publisher's Description**  
  

Ping program; useful to test your connection. Enter a web address or a valid
host name, e.g. http://www.google.com or google.com, or a valid IP address,
e.g. 98.137.149.56 (IPv4) ,[2a00:1450:8006::93] (IPv6). The IP addresses are
converted into host names and conversely. An empty input gives local IP
address.

The button "Options..." opens the WinPing options: Infinite Loop (runs pings
in a infinite loop and shows the average in real time), Time options (Timeout,
Temporisation between every ping in milliseconds), Multiping (for several
pings one after the other), Retries, Average of the response times, Hostname
List, ip-to-country File... Sort and Replace utilities will allow you to edit
and save host name list, countries list or any text file.

The "Auto-Save" option will allow you to save thousands of lines of pinging
information (in Infinite Loop Mode). A Ping Graph (with axis scale and
Y-offset adjustment) allows you easily to view, in real time, Average and
Pings points for every loop. You can easily save and load the Ping Curves
using the Graph Options.

This version updates ping error messages, and updates IP address pinging. Now
you can ping an IPv6 address, and you can show all resolved IP addresses of a
domain name.

This program works with all version of Windows. If your system is Windows XP
or older, it requires the [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-
Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) or higher.
