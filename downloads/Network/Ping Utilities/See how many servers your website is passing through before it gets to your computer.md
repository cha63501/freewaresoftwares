Traceroute allows you to see how many servers your website is passing through before it gets to your computer, informing you if there are any problem/slow servers and even gives a ping time for each server in the path. 

With Traceroute, you can easily find out where the heart of a server problem is. If you have a slow server or a timeout error, it may not always be the server where the site is located that is causing the problem. Trellian Traceroute can help you to find out for sure.
