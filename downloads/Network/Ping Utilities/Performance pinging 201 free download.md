**Publisher's Description**  
  

Perfping is a tool that allows you to ping a host continuously or with a
single ping using different data volumes. This can give you an indication of
the performance of the route to your host.

You can change the ping intervall from 2 to 30 seconds using various timeouts.
The timeout is always smaller than the pinging interval. Results are written
to log window and log file if so chosen. Unreachable hosts have a value of 0
ms.
