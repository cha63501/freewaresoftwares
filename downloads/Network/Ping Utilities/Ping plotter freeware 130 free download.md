**Publisher's Description**  
  

Ping Plotter is a fast, small, and visual Ping/Trace Route utility that uses
multiple threads to trace all hops at once for SUBSTANTIAL performance
improvements over standard trace routes.

Delivers visual graphs of performance to pinpoint problems and see ranges of
responses and trends. Will trace continuously with any interval. Show your ISP
where their problems are - so they can fix it!

Useful for everyone from the home trouble-shooter to the full-time network
administrator that needs more information (presented in an easy to read way)
about their network (be it a dial-up connection, LAN/WAN, or fat internet
pipe).
