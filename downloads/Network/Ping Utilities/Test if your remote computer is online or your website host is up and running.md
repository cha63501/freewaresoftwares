**Publisher's Description**  
  


Test if your remote computer is online or your website host is up and running using Network Ping. Windows does not provide a graphical utility to ping hosts, it only has a command line tool. This software can ping remote computers just like ping.exe that comes with your operating system. It has multiple parameters that you can set right from the program, visual output, export and print features. Use a better ping!
