**Publisher's Description**  
  

JMPing : Is a command line tool utility that allows you to get an ok or not ok
response whether your ping has been successful or not. JMPing is by design
quicker than normal ping command as the response timeout is set by default to
10 milliseconds. This timeout allows you to quick ping machine in a Local Area
Network environnement, but you need to set a larger timeout if you plan to
ping a machine over a Wide Area Network like Internet. JMPing sets a success
(0) or unsuccess (1) value in ERRORLEVEL in order to let you write batch
scripts. You can now check if a machine is present on your network before
launching a network request for example.
