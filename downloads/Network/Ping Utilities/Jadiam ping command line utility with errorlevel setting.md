**Publisher's Description**  
  


JMPing : Is a command line tool utility that allows you to get an ok or not ok response whether your ping has been successful or not. JMPing is by design quicker than normal ping command as the response timeout is set by default to 10 milliseconds. This timeout allows you to quick ping machine in a Local Area Network environnement, but you need to set a larger timeout if you plan to ping a machine over a Wide Area Network like Internet. JMPing sets a success (0) or unsuccess (1) value in ERRORLEVEL in order to let you write batch scripts. You can now check if a machine is present on your network before launching a network request for example.
