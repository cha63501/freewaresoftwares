**Publisher's Description**  
  

HSLAB Ping is a visual computer network utility used to test the reachability
of a computer on an Internet Protocol (IP) network and to measure the response
(round-trip time) for messages sent from the originating computer to a
destination computer. The name "PING" comes from active sonar terminology.

HSLAB Ping operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo
request packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP response.
