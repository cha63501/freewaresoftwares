**Publisher's Description**  
  

Traceroute allows you to see how many servers your website is passing through
before it gets to your computer, informing you if there are any problem/slow
servers and even gives a ping time for each server in the path.

With Traceroute, you can easily find out where the heart of a server problem
is. If you have a slow server or a timeout error, it may not always be the
server where the site is located that is causing the problem. Trellian
Traceroute can help you to find out for sure.
