**Publisher's Description**  
  

It has been suggested in voice over IP that an appropriate choice of the
distribution used in modeling the delay jitters, can improve the play-out
algorithm. In this paper, we propose a tool using which, one can determine, at
a given instance, which distribution model best explains the jitter
distribution. This tool uses the basic PING function as a base to perform the
scan.
