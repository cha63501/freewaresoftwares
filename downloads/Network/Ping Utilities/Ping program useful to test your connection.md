**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ping program; useful to test your connection. Enter a web address or a valid host name, e.g. http://www.google.com or google.com, or a valid IP address, e.g. 98.137.149.56 (IPv4) ,[2a00:1450:8006::93] (IPv6). The IP addresses are converted into host names and conversely. An empty input gives local IP address. 

The button "Options..." opens the WinPing options: Infinite Loop (runs pings in a infinite loop and shows the average in real time), Time options (Timeout, Temporisation between every ping in milliseconds), Multiping (for several pings one after the other), Retries, Average of the response times, Hostname List, ip-to-country File... Sort and Replace utilities will allow you to edit and save host name list, countries list or any text file. 

The "Auto-Save" option will allow you to save thousands of lines of pinging information (in Infinite Loop Mode). A Ping Graph (with axis scale and Y-offset adjustment) allows you easily to view, in real time, Average and Pings points for every loop. You can easily save and load the Ping Curves using the Graph Options. 

This version updates ping error messages, and updates IP address pinging. Now you can ping an IPv6 address, and you can show all resolved IP addresses of a domain name. 

This program works with all version of Windows. If your system is Windows XP or older, it requires the [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) or higher.
