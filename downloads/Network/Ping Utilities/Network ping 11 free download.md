**Publisher's Description**  
  

Test if your remote computer is online or your website host is up and running
using Network Ping. Windows does not provide a graphical utility to ping
hosts, it only has a command line tool. This software can ping remote
computers just like ping.exe that comes with your operating system. It has
multiple parameters that you can set right from the program, visual output,
export and print features. Use a better ping!
