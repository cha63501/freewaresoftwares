**Publisher's Description**  
  


TrayPing is an application built to be a powerful and free host monitoring program. Its purpose is to periodically "ping" a remote host and provide a simple and unobtrusive way to report to you that the host is up or down. It does this by placing a red heart icon in the system tray if the host is up, and a dark blue icon in the tray when the host is down. 

TrayPing is smart enough to not waste too much network bandwidth. It pings the host in one-second intervals until the host has responded five consecutive times, after which point TrayPing waits 30 seconds between updates. When the host does not respond to one of those long interval updates, TrayPing then resumes pinging at one second intervals until it responds again or is down for five consecutive tries.
