**Publisher's Description**  
  

TrayPing is an application built to be a powerful and free host monitoring
program. Its purpose is to periodically "ping" a remote host and provide a
simple and unobtrusive way to report to you that the host is up or down. It
does this by placing a red heart icon in the system tray if the host is up,
and a dark blue icon in the tray when the host is down.

TrayPing is smart enough to not waste too much network bandwidth. It pings the
host in one-second intervals until the host has responded five consecutive
times, after which point TrayPing waits 30 seconds between updates. When the
host does not respond to one of those long interval updates, TrayPing then
resumes pinging at one second intervals until it responds again or is down for
five consecutive tries.
