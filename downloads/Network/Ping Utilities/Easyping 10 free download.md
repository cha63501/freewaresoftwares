**Publisher's Description**  
  

EasyPing! is an easy to use Network tool to ping multiple hosts. As soon as
you add a host to the list, the IP address is resolved. If no IP address is
found, you can still add it to the list for further pinging.

Once your list is completed, you can save that list of hosts to use it later
on with EasyPing! or, you can Export a batch file that starts pinging all your
hosts at once. (Very useful in networks to see if servers are available)

**Features:**

  * Start multiple ping at the same time. 
  * Save/load a list of hosts. 
  * Verify if the hostname is resolvable via DNS. 
  * Automatically create a batch file to easily launch multiple icmp requests on multiple hosts without the need of the main exe file. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
