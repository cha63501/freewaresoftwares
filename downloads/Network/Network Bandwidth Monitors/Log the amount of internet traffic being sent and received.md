The purpose of this program is to simply log the amount of internet traffic being sent and received. The program will display the amount of traffic that has passed since your current connection was established and add the amount of traffic onto the all time total. 

To ensure the amount of traffic passing through your connection is logged, this program will load when Windows starts. You can prevent this by deleting the shortcut placed in your Startup folder on your Start Menu.

The counters can be reset by right clicking on the icon placed in the system tray.

This program was created with Visual Basic 2008 and requires [Microsoft .NET framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html). The setup will prompt you if you do not have this installed and will also launch a link to download the prerequisites from the internet.
