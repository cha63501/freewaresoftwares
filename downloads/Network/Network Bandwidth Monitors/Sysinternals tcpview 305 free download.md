**Publisher's Description**  
  

TCPView is a Windows program that will show you detailed listings of all TCP
and UDP endpoints on your system, including the local and remote addresses and
state of TCP connections. On Windows NT, 2000 and XP TCPView also reports the
name of the process that owns the endpoint. TCPView provides a more
informative and conveniently presented subset of the Netstat program that
ships with Windows. The TCPView download includes Tcpvcon, a command-line
version with the same functionality.

TCPView works on Windows Vista/NT/2000/XP and Windows 98/Me. You can use
TCPView on Windows 95 if you get the Windows 95 Winsock 2 Update from
Microsoft.

**WhatA's New in version 3.05:**
