**Publisher's Description**  
  

A small package of programs for logging and producing graphs for FTTC
connections that use the Huawei HG612 modem. The logging and graphing can all
be automated using the included graphic user interface & settings editor or
setting up your own scheduled tasks.

Please note with this version the task should be deleted and recreated.

[Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-
Framework-4_program_55008.html) is required for the graphic user interface.

The logging and graphing section was written by Bald_Eagle1 and the graphic
user interface was written by Ronski. See the instruction PDF for full
credits.

**WhatA's New in version 2.0:**

  * The programs now work with both HG612s with October 2013A's updated firmware & HG612s where firmware updates have either not taken place or have been blocked. 
  * Issues with Windows 8 sheduled tasks stopping after a few hors/days *appear* to have been resolved. 
  * More efficient program operation.The programs no longer wait until a called program completes, freeing up CPU & memory resources. 
  * The HG612A's firmware version is now reported in Plink logs (Current_Stats folder) & xlogfile.txt (Ongoing_Stats folder). 
  * HG612 Stats logging GUI.exe now displays various stats. 
  * HG612 Stats logging GUI.exe can now display a slide show of various graphs/montages. 
  * HG612 Stats logging GUI.exe can now display ThinkBroadbandA's Ping graphs. 
  * Extensive event logging can now be switched off via HG612 Stats logging GUI.exe. Very basic event logging is recorded & only genuine errors are recorded in the various error/event log files when extensive logging is switched off. This dramatically reduces the size of the various log files. 
  * HG612_stats.ini file delay settings are now ignored for Vista upward, the delay setting now delaying the start of the scheduled task task rather than a pause in the program. The existing task needs to be deleted & re-created via HG612 Stats logging GUI.exe to effect this change. 
  * INP graph is now included in Ongoing stats FULL_MONTY montage. 
  * Numerous other tweaks and bug fixes that we canA't remember :-)
