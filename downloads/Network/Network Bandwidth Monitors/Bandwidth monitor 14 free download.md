**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bandwidth monitor is a tool used for observing the transmission and reception
of data flow from your network. It displays total and average bandwidth
readings as well as how much bandwidth wasted from overhead. The tool comes
equipped with a graphical display to illustrate network fluctuation. It can be
used to determine if downloads or uploads are sporadic (lots of packet delays
and drops) or if your network is optimal by showing a steady line of activity.

Bandwidth Monitor is also unique in that it allows you to create custom
profiles. The profiles tell Bandwidth Monitor which packets are to be
recorded. This allows services such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP to be separated and
collected for specific readings.
