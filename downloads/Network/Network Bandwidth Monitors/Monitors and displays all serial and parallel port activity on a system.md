**Publisher's Description**  
  


Portmon is a utility that monitors and displays all serial and parallel port activity on a system. 

It has advanced filtering and search capabilities that make it a powerful tool for exploring the way Windows works, seeing how applications use ports, or tracking down problems in system or application configurations.

**Features:**

  * **Remote monitoring:** Capture kernel-mode and/or Win32 debug output from any computer accessible via TCP/IP - even across the Internet. You can monitor multiple remote computers simultaneously. Portmon will even install its client software itself if you are running it on a Windows NT/2K system and are capturing from another Windows NT/2K system in the same Network Neighborhood. 
  * **Most-recent-filter lists:** Portmon has been extended with powerful filtering capabilities and it remembers your most recent filter selections, with an interface that makes it easy to reselect them. Clipboard copy: Select multiple lines in the output window and copy their contents to the clipboard. 
  * **Highlighting:** Highlight debug output that matches your highlighting filter, and even customize the highlighting colors. 
  * **Log-to-file:** Write debug output to a file as its being captured. 
  * **Printing: Print all or part of captured debug output to a printer. One-file payload:Portmon is now implemented as one file. **

**WhatA's New in version 3.03:**

  * Includes some minor bug fixes and user-interface consistency updates.
