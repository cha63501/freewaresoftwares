**Publisher's Description**  
  

Network Activity Indicator displays the old A'two monitorsA' icon in Windows 7
that flashed blue to show network activity on the System Tray.

Unlike the original Windows XP utility (that has individual indicators for
each interface), this program indicates outgoing and incoming network packets
on all available interfaces.

This utility is a standalone executable. Run the program, youA'll see a new
system tray icon. Now you can monitor your network traffic in Windows 7 using
XP-like A'two monitorsA' icon in the System Tray.

To customize program settings right click the mouse on the System Tray icon.
