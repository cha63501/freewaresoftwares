Network Activity Indicator displays the old A'two monitorsA' icon in Windows 7 that flashed blue to show network activity on the System Tray. 

Unlike the original Windows XP utility (that has individual indicators for each interface), this program indicates outgoing and incoming network packets on all available interfaces.

This utility is a standalone executable. Run the program, youA'll see a new system tray icon. Now you can monitor your network traffic in Windows 7 using XP-like A'two monitorsA' icon in the System Tray. 

To customize program settings right click the mouse on the System Tray icon.
