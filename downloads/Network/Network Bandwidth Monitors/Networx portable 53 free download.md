**Publisher's Description**  
  

NetWorx is a simple and free, yet powerful tool that helps you objectively
evaluate your bandwidth situation. You can use it to collect bandwidth usage
data and measure the speed of your Internet or any other network connection.
NetWorx can help you identify possible sources of network problems, ensure
that you do not exceed the bandwidth limits specified by your ISP, or track
down suspicious network activity characteristic of Trojan horses and hacker
attacks.

The program allows you to monitor all your network connections or a specific
network connection (such as Ethernet or PPP) only. The software also features
a system of highly customizable visual and sound alerts. You can set it up to
alert you when the network connection is down or when some suspicious
activity, such as unusually heavy data flow, occurs. It can also automatically
disconnect all dialup connections and shut down the system.

The incoming and outgoing traffic is represented on a line chart and logged to
a file, so that you can always view statistics about your daily, weekly and
monthly bandwidth usage and dialup duration. The reports can be exported to a
variety of formats, such as HTML, MS Word and Excel, for further analysis.
