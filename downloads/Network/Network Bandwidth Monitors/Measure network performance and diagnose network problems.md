**Publisher's Description**  
  


Axence NetTools is a solution for measuring network performance and diagnosing network problems. Its most powerful component is graphical MultiPing with a history of response time and packets lost (for monitoring the availability of your hosts). It also consists of other tools like trace, lookup, and port/network scanner. 

A comprehensive set of administration tools:

**NetWatch** \- network monitoring with alerting, real-time & historical charts of response time & packet lost. E-mail and sound notifications available when a host is down. 

**WinTools** \- lists exhaustive system information from Windows computers: running processes & services, registry, event log, disk, memory & CPU information. 

**Port Scanner** \- checks for all open ports and running services. It can discover some Trojans/spyware. 

**Network Scanner** \- discovers all nodes, their IP/MAC and services running on them. 

**NetStat** \- displays your computer's inbound and outbound connections, lists all open TCP/UDP ports, with the remote IP address & the process using the connection. 

**TCP/IP Workshop** \- establishes low-level TCP/UDP connections to troubleshoot and test network services. It can send raw data to any remote port. Other tools: ping, fast trace route, lookup, bandwidth test tool, SNMP browser.

**NetCheck** \- With this tool you can check the quality of network hardware in your LAN.

**Ping** \- A visual replacement for Windows ping, but with a 5 - minute history. 

**Fast Traceroute** \- This tool is much more than just a replacement for Windows tracert. The full traceroute is done in 1 second and it gives you information about every host on the route, its response time, and packets lost, so you can quickly determine where the problems are occurring. It's easy to locate hosts with degraded performance, or ones that are just overloaded. 

**Lookup** \- This works like nslookup, but shows you all records at once.

**Local info** \- Displays several tables with important information about your local configuration: network statistics for TCP/UDP and ICMP, IP address table, ARP table, IP routing table, and network adapter info. 

**Bandwidth measuring** \- Will measure bandwidth without overloading your network. 

**Note:** This version is free of charge. Simple registration is required after 30 days.
