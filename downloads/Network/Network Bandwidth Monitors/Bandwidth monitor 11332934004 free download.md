**Publisher's Description**  
  

The purpose of this program is to simply log the amount of internet traffic
being sent and received. The program will display the amount of traffic that
has passed since your current connection was established and add the amount of
traffic onto the all time total.

To ensure the amount of traffic passing through your connection is logged,
this program will load when Windows starts. You can prevent this by deleting
the shortcut placed in your Startup folder on your Start Menu.

The counters can be reset by right clicking on the icon placed in the system
tray.

This program was created with Visual Basic 2008 and requires [Microsoft .NET
framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-
3_program_31320.html). The setup will prompt you if you do not have this
installed and will also launch a link to download the prerequisites from the
internet.
