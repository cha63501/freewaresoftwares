**Publisher's Description**  
  

KarenA's LAN Monitor starts by displaying important information about every
network adapter on your computer. These details include the adapterA's speed,
IP address(es), DHCP Lease information, and more.

Next, the program shows all current connections between your computer and
others on the local network, and on the Internet. YouA'll see the name and IP
address of the remote computer, and the type of connection (HTTP, POP3, FTP,
etc) thatA's being made!

The LAN Monitor also displays real-time traffic statistics, including bytes
sent and received, transmission errors, and network connection load factors.

**Note:** The LAN Monitor requires features that are not included in Windows 95. As a result, Windows 98, or later, is required.

**WhatA's New in version 1.4.4:**

  * Added workaround to handle network adapters that report a speed of "-1" (some Intel Wi-Fi adapters on some Toshiba laptops, and perhaps others). Also added additional code to handle situations where more than 8 GB of data are sent or received during a time period (previously, this could cause the reported data volume to be negative).
