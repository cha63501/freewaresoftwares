**Publisher's Description**  
  

Use SHAREManager to quickly add, update or remove network shares in a standard
way across your Windows network. Remove admin shares - or add them to make
network management easier. Limit access to specific users or groups, defining
the access type allowed. Use parameters in share names to apply a standard
share naming convention across your network - for example, use this to apply a
consistent hidden share naming approach. SHAREManager is a free tool that
works either by itself or complementing our award winning centralised storage
management tool, SPACEWatch Pro.
