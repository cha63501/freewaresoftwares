**Publisher's Description**  
  

NetworkInterfacesView is a simple tool that displays a list of all network
adapters/interfaces installed on your system. It displays network interfaces
that are currently active, as well as network interfaces that have been
installed previously, and now they are not connected (like USB wireless
network adapters).

For every network interface found on your system, the following information is
displayed (if itA's stored in the Registry): Device Name, Connection Name, IP
Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, DHCP Server, Status, MAC Address and
more...

You can select one or more network interface items and then export them to
xml/html/csv/tab-delimited file, or copy them into the clipboard and then
paste them into Excel or other spreadsheet application.
