**Publisher's Description**  
  

Encrypting your wireless internet access requires an encryption key, and
Wireless Key Generator not only can provide you with this it can save your key
to a text file ready for storing on a usb memory stick or CD. Giving you a
simple means of entering your key on each wireless device requiring a secure
internet access.

Although Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is supported it is no longer
recommended due to the number of programs available that can crack and
determine the encryption key within seconds. So Wi-Fi Protected Access
(WPA/WPA2) should be used if possible on all wireless access points and
routers.

Once Wireless Key Generator is open first select your desired encryption type,
either "Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)" or "Wi-Fi Protected Access(WPA/WPA2)
depending on what security requirments of the wireless access point or router.

Then select the required key strength to match and click on the 'Generate'
button.

To Save the key to a text file click onto the 'Save' button and enter a file
name in the save dialog box, clicking the save button.

You can also copy the key to the clipboard by simply clicking onto the 'Copy'
button.
