**Publisher's Description**  
  

ComSpy2 is a handy application for processing, sending and receiving data
through various communication objects to test external devices. It is
specifically designed to transfer small data packets used in doing things like
processing responses from external devices and sending commands. It is not
meant to analyze major communication protocols or data flows.

Communication objects can have either inputs or outputs, or both, which are
known as channels. The input has at least one channel that the object defines
while the output broadcasts to all objects specified in the broadcast list.
There are also special-purpose channels.

You can drag objects and drop them onto the object panel and then design your
data flow by dragging outputs to inputs.

ComSpy2 was initially designed to listen in on serial COM ports before being
expanded to include TCP/IP, File I/O, LPT, UDP and USB Printer interface. It
can present data as ANSI Terminal, HEX, ASCII, bitmaps or Graph.

You can use the Script object to create a GUI for firing test cases with one
bush.

In a nutshell, ComSpy2 allows you to easily build tools for testing hardware
and software using drag and drop. It is ideal for firmware or hardware
developers because it allows for communication with hardware before installing
any supporting software. It can also be used to create different things,
including Syslog servers, MUD clients, SMTP clients and other terminals.
