**Publisher's Description**  
  


EyeOnSite is a tool that keeps an eye on your sites or servers to see if they are accessible on the net. The services that can be monitored are http, ftp, smtp and pop3. When a service goes down, you can choose to be alerted with a visual message or an audible alarm. In addition, you can send an email message or launch an application which can be used to correct the situation. All error events are logged in individual log files and stats generated for each service. The status window shows the current state of all monitored services.
