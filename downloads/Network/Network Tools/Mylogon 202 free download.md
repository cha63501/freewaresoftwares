**Publisher's Description**  
  

MyLogon is an alternative to the standard Windows Logon or Welcome Screen,
which may offer advantages for certain types of network, particularly for
laptop-users who connect to multiple domains, business workgroups, data-entry
stations, and situations where users must be able to log-on at any computer
interchangeably. Allows XP Home to properly log-on to a fileserver.
