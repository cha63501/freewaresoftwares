**Publisher's Description**  
  

Protocol Reader A(r) is a powerful protocol analyse tool for parsing and
displaying received binary messages. With an easy-to-use interface and
programable kernel, it can support variety of protocols such as IP based
protocols(TCP,UDP, etc), Telcomunication protocols (MTP3, ISUP,TUP, etc), or
you can define new custom decoders of non-standard or rare protocols..

Unlike other protocol analyzer tool, we provide advanced features to meet
future needs, not only for standard protocols, but also for user-defined
protocols . Instead of waiting long time for a new protocol decoder to be
released, you can easily write a script to support new protocols in a
incredible short time by yourself.

ProtocolReader makes it easy to create a new package decoder, try it!
