**Publisher's Description**  
  

Patch Downloader simplifies the task of downloading patches for various ESX
versions by automating the task. If a user does not want to, or cannot, use
Update Manager (because they do not have a license or do not have internet
access from the ESX/VC hosts) they must download patches manually from the
VMware website through a Java Download manager. ItA's easy to miss a patch,
and painfully slow to find and select the ones you want. These downloaded
patches go on an HTTP or FTP repository, or are copied direct to each host
over SSH, and the esxupdate utility is used to patch the ESX host.

With Patch Downloader, you just open the app, select the version of ESX from
the drop down, and select a file repository (folder, drive map, SMB share,
etc.) where you want to download the patches. It lists all of the available
ESX patches as well as information about each including description and
severity of the problem it corrects and the impact to the VM/Host. The patch
grid can be sorted by column so itA's easy to bring all the CRITICAL patches
to the top, for example. When you click download, it will download all of the
VMware ESX patches you select to the repository, but skip any that are already
there A simplifying your ESX patch management by keeping your ESX patch
repository up to date.
