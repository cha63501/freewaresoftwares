Our on-demand monitoring service makes it easy and affordable to detect network and website failures early, minimizing downtime and avoiding economic impact. 

Bello network monitoring service periodically checks your website as well as your other servers. As soon as outages are discovered you will be notified via email, SMS/pager or ICQ message. For the free starter account the monitoring interval is 60 minutes, for full service accounts you can choose monitoring intervals down to one minute. Sensor types include PING, PORT, HTTP, HTTPS, Advanced HTTP, HTTP Transaction, DNS, SMTP, POP3, SNMP, FTP and more.

Even if you run your own monitoring systems you might want to consider using our on-demand monitoring service as a "second opinion" about the availability of websites and their uptimes, e.g. when SLA (service level agreements) must be checked.

**FREE STARTER ACCOUNT:** Available free of charge this account type offers the monitoring of two sensors with an interval of 60 minutes. Notifications can be sent via email and ICQ.
