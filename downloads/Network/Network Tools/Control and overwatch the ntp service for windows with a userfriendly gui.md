**Publisher's Description**  
  


The NTP Time Server Monitor software is able to control and overwatch the NTP service for Windows with a userfriendly GUI. Additionally it eases the handling with the NTP service. 

**Features:**

  * Switch easily between different configurations (ntp.conf files). This is perfectly usable if different configuration must be tested or to switch between testing and operating mode. 
  * Change the service settings without the need to open the device manager each time. 
  * Extract the NTP related application log entries and display them separately in a table. The user can filter the entries by categories. 
  * Display the current status of the running NTP service. In fact it is a graphical output of the command "ntpq -p". Additionally the current offset, stratum value and the selected synchronization source is displayed in a status string. The status is automatically refreshed. The user can select the refresh interval. 
  * The user can configure external NTP server, which are also queried by the NTP Time Server Monitor and the status is also displayed. 
  * The configuration file of the ntp service (ntp.conf) can be edited within this program. So it is no longer necessary to search for the right file in the possible locations within the Windows or NTP directory. If changes are made the program is asking if the service shall be restarted. 
  * The NTP Time Server Monitor is able to read the system variables and association vars of the service and displays them in a textbox for analyzing. 
  * Statistic: The generated loopstats files can be shown in a graphical component. The period of logging, the number of entries, the start and stop time and the minimum and maximum values of the offset and frequency are extracted and displayed. If required the generated statistic can be exported as a bitmap. 
  * The program can be minimized to the tray icon bar of Windows. A tooltip shows the current status (source, offset, stratum), if the mouse is pointing over the Meinberg logo. 
  * A configuration panel let the user control the NTP Time Server Monitor. For example: Polling interval of the NTP status, DNS lookups, external NTP server, logfiles locations.
