**Publisher's Description**  
  

ThinXP runs a Windows XP Workstation like a Citrix WinCE Thin Client. It uses
the Citrix ICA Client as shell replacement. On startup it shows the Citrix
Desktop instead of the WindowsXP Desktop (Kiosk mode).

It has also the ability to force a auto logon. This means that the user canA't
access the Windows Desktop (Kiosk mode). Instead of the Windows Desktop only
the Citrix ICA Desktop is shown to the User.

ThinXP gives also the ability to force an auto logon as local or as AD-Domain
User on the Windows XP Workstation.
