**Publisher's Description**  
  


SIP Tester is a free VoIP load testing tool which enables you to test VoIP network, SIP software or hardware. 

It is able to simulate thousands of simultaneous incoming and outgoing SIP calls with RTP media, analyze call quality and build real time reports. Call flow is specified by CallXML script where one can design various situations which can cause failure of SIP stack which is being tested. The SIP tester runs on any Windows PC without special hardware and simulates application server, media server, SIP phone or registrar.

**Features:**
