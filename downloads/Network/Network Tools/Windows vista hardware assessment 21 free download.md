**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Windows Vista Hardware Assessment is a tool that will find computers on a
network and perform a detailed inventory of the computers using Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI). Through use of the detailed inventory data,
the tool will assess and report whether the computers can run Windows Vista or
the 2007 Microsoft Office system, where to find drivers for devices on the
computers, and provide recommendations for hardware upgrades, where
appropriate.

The Windows Vista Hardware Assessment tool does not require the deployment of
agent software on the computers being inventoried and assessed. It provides a
secure, quick, and easy way to determine which computers, in a networked
environment, are ready for Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system
software.

For home users and users with a few Windows XP computers to migrate, use the
