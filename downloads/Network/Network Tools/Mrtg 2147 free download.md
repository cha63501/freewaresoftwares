**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) is a tool to monitor the traffic load
on network links. MRTG generates HTML pages containing PNG images which
provide a LIVE visual representation of this traffic.

You have a router, you want to know what it does all day long? Then MRTG is
for you. It will monitor SNMP network devices and draw pretty pictures showing
how much traffic has passed through each interface.

Routers are only the beginning. MRTG is being used to graph all sorts of
network devices as well as everything else from weather data to vending
machines.

MRTG is written in perl and works on Unix/Linux as well as Windows and even
Netware systems. MRTG is free software licensed under the Gnu GPL.
