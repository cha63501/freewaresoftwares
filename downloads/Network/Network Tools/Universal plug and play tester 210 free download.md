**Publisher's Description**  
  

Universal Plug-and-Play Tester (UPnPTest) is an experimental tool that lists
all the available devices compatible with the Universal Plug-and-Play protocol
including routers (IGDs).

When the program starts it first checks the configuration of the required UPnP
services and the Windows Firewall and possibly configure them for you (after
being prompted). Then it searches for available devices and updates the list
as devices are plugged or unplugged.

The status window displays miscellaneous notifications and the IP addresses of
the routers as they are assigned.

You can also select a device or a service from the list and click
Properties... to get some information about it or to query a service using the
available actions.

**Notes:**

  * In the properties, double-click any URL to open it in your default browser. 
  * the device discovery is only available in Windows 98 (with ICS), ME and XP 
  * Universal Plug-and-Play is an optional component so you may have to installed it from the Control Panel > Add or Remove Programs > Add/Remove Windows Components > Networking services > Universal Plug-and-Play or Internet Gateway Device Discovery and Control Client and UPnP User Interface (Windows XP SP2 and later) 
  * you may also have to enable Universal Plug-and-Play in your router configuration screen
