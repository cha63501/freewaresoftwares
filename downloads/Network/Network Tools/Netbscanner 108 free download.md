**Publisher's Description**  
  

NetBScanner is a network scanner tool that scans all computers in the IP
address range you choose, using NetBIOS protocol.

For every computer located by this NetBIOS scanner, the following information
is displayed: IP Address, Computer Name, Workgroup or Domain, MAC Address, and
the company that manufactured the network adapter (determined according to the
MAC address).

NetBScanner also shows whether a computer is a Master Browser. You can easily
select one or more computers found by NetBScanner, and then export the list
into csv/tab-delimited/xml/html file.

**System Requirements:**

  * This utility works on every version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 8, including both 32-bit systems and x64 systems. 
  * NetBIOS scan uses UDP port 137 to send and receive the NetBIOS data. If this port is blocked by your computer or in the remote network computers that you scan, the NetBIOS scan will not work. 
  * When you run NetBScanner in the first time, you might get a warning from the Firewall of Windows. Even if you choose to keep blocking NetBScanner, the NetBIOS scan will still work properly. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.08:**

  * NetBScanner now automatically skips the broadcast addresses, according to the IP addresses/Subnet masks settings of every network adapter on your system.
