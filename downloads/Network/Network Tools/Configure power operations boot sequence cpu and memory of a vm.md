**Publisher's Description**  
  


Virtual MachineA's emulates all aspects of an actual computer and creates a separate environment for running operating system. Each operating system is logically isolated with host server and also multiple such VMs running simultaneously on the same host physical server. Virtual servers provide great cost benefits as opposed to real physical server. This encourages people to run many applications and services on these virtual servers. The application, that is running within the virtual servers need to be running all the time. Any outage or performance degradation in the virtual servers, will affect the applications and services running on them, resulting in a bad user-experience. Hence it becomes imperative to monitor and manage those virtual servers continuously at all times so that you know early enough about a possible problem, before it translates into substantial loss of revenue.
