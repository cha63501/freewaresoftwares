**Publisher's Description**  
  


The UPnP PortMapper is an easy to use program that manages the port mappings (port forwarding) of a UPnP enabled internet gateway device (router) in the local network. You can easily view, add and remove port mappings. 

Using port forwarding, it is possible to access servers (SSH, Web, Game servers, ...) running in a private network from the internet. Port mappings can be configured using the web administration interface of a router, but using the UPnP PortMapper is much more convenient: Just create a new preset or select an existing preset and click one button to add a port mapping for your current computer, the IP address is retrieved automatically!

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
