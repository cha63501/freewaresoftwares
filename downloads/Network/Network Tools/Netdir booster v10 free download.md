**Publisher's Description**  
  

Do you want to increase speed access to network shared folder? When you list
the contents of a remote folder to which your computer is connected by TCP/IP,
the results may take much more time to display than when you view a local
folder. This delay occurs whether you use Windows NT Explorer or a command
prompt to view the folder. This issue is not specific to any particular
network configuration.

Use NetDir Booster to set new values and increase access speed.
