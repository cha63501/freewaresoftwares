**Publisher's Description**  
  

The UPnP PortMapper is an easy to use program that manages the port mappings
(port forwarding) of a UPnP enabled internet gateway device (router) in the
local network. You can easily view, add and remove port mappings.

Using port forwarding, it is possible to access servers (SSH, Web, Game
servers, ...) running in a private network from the internet. Port mappings
can be configured using the web administration interface of a router, but
using the UPnP PortMapper is much more convenient: Just create a new preset or
select an existing preset and click one button to add a port mapping for your
current computer, the IP address is retrieved automatically!

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
