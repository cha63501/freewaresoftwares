**Publisher's Description**  
  

CurrPorts displays a list of all currently opened TCP/IP and UDP ports on your
local computer. For each port in the list, information about the process that
opened the port is also displayed, including the process name, version
information, the user that created it, and more.

In addition, CurrPorts allows you to close unwanted TCP connections, kill the
process that opened the ports, and save the TCP/UDP ports list to HTML file,
and more.

**WhatA's New in version 2.10:**

  * When saving the opened ports from command-line, CurrPorts now uses the same columns order saved in the .cfg file.
