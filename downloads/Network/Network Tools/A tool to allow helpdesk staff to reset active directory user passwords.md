**Publisher's Description**  
  


Password Control is a tool designed to allow helpdesk staff and other IT support personnel to reset user passwords. It has a simple and intuitive interface that many users find more productive than a custom MMC console. 

Password Control is designed to work with Active Directory based domains. It also features other functions such as the ability to enable and disable user accounts (you can edit a config file to remove these features if required). 

Bulk Password Control is a tool to allow you to reset passwords for large numbers of Active Directory user accounts. Using the password generator, a different password can be used for each user account (reccomended) or you can choose to use the same password for all user accounts. Bulk Password Control can also be used to enable/disable and unlock user accounts.

Bulk Modify is an optional component of Password Control that allows you to bulk modify active directory user attributes. For example, you could use Bulk Modify to ensure all user accounts in your domain have a common-name that conforms to the company policy that the common name should be set as "LastName, FirstName". You can also use it to add/remove groups, change logon hours, bulk load user photos and modify many other AD attributes. Bulk Modify is styled to look similar to the user dialog box in Active Directory Users and Computers. This will make it easy to identify the attribute you want to modify as you can locate it the same way as you do in the familiar ADU&C dialog.
