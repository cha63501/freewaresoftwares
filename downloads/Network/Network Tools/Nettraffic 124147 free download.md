**Publisher's Description**  
  

NetTraffic allows you to view and to be informed of download speed and upload
speed in real time. Select a Network Interface Card (by eg. Fast Ethernet
Card, Wireless Card...), and instantly it displays the network traffic
(graphic bars and animated icon if you choose this option).

The "Options" button opens NetTraffic options: run at Windows startup;
bars/icon scale; max values; refresh time; you can display the speeds in
window title.

With the "System Tray" option, balloon tips appear in the taskbar tray; you
can choose the condition to display the message (eg. if download speed >= 1000
KB/s).

This version fixes a graphic bug; adds a "Run at Windows startup" option and
adds a autosave settings file.

This program works with all version of Windows except Windows 98 and Windows
Me. If your system is Windows XP or older, it requires the [Microsoft .NET
Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-
Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) or higher.
