It has also the ability to force a auto logon. This means that the user canA't access the Windows Desktop (Kiosk mode). Instead of the Windows Desktop only the Citrix ICA Desktop is shown to the User.

ThinXP gives also the ability to force an auto logon as local or as AD-Domain User on the Windows XP Workstation.
