**Publisher's Description**  
  

This program scans devices on your local network or the Internet to determine
if they are accessible from your computer. Use it to:

  * Quickly determine if there is a problem on your home or small business network 
  * Identify and locate intermittent network problems 
  * Monitor your favorite web servers to see if they are up or down 
The program uses the ECHO protocol to test each device at regular intervals
and displays the devices status in the main window. A log file records status
changes of each device, providing useful troubleshooting information. If a
computer can not be reached, the reason why is displayed in the status column.
