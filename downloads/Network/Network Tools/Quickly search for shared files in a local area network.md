**Publisher's Description**  
  


Any medium-sized corporate network where users share folders and files needs an efficient method of searching for relevant content, which is where SoftPerfect Network Search Engine comes in. The powerful search engine indexes all shared files in a local area network, and it allows users to search for specific files quickly. 

Users are assured of getting search results within seconds irrespective of the number of shared folders and files. The search engine has an intuitive Web-based user interface that allows searchers to use simple wild-card format in their search queries.

Configuring and deploying the search engine is easy, thanks to its built-in Web-server and database. Its administration console uses a graphic user interface that makes it easy to adjust its powerful configuration options. You can maintain the index via an incremental multi-threaded crawl mode to use as little network resources as necessary. You can also exclude selected folders and files from the index, and the search engine will keep off unnecessary traffic after completing the initial indexing.

Users will notice improvement within minutes of the deployment of SoftPerfect Network Search Engine, and they will hardly require training to use it efficiently.
