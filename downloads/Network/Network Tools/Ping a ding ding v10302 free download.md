**Publisher's Description**  
  

The programA's main use is to alert a user if a pingable host has gone down or
come up.

This project was born when I was having trouble with a server at work that
kept freezing up. What I wanted was a little program to sit and alert me when
the server went down so I could nip downstairs to reboot it.

That and realising that "Ping a Ding Ding" sounded like a great name for such
a program persuaded me to put it together.
