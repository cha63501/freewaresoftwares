Email WAN IP Address is a utility that automatically checks your networkAs WAN
(Wide Area Network) Address and emails or texts a message to the address or
addresses and / or mobile computing device you specify.

This is important in case you are using VNC or some other application that
requires knowing the IP at the other end. Our softwareAs service is performed
on a timer and notifies those you list only in the event the IP address
changes.

For those with a Dynamic IP, a change is likely every time you log on.
Otherwise, your ISP may renew your IP lease periodically without you knowing.
