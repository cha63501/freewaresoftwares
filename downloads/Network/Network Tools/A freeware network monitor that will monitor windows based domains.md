**Publisher's Description**  
  


NetScanG is an easy, free and powerful network monitor for WindowsA(c) based networks, with device tracking and port scanning capabilities. Unlike most other monitoring programs that mostly focus on server monitoring, NetScanG monitors all computers in the domain continuously. Because of this, NetScanG is capable of providing a real-time overview of the entire domain. 

**Features:**

  * Email: A built-in Email engine can issue warnings when a device in an Ping Range isnA't responding or when a user exceeds the number of allowed simultaneous logins. 
  * No client software installation: NetScanG run from a single server, and does not require software to be installed on monitered clients 
  * Low disk usage: NetScanG uses its own extremely space efficient database engine, and requires almost no space for logs 
  * XML based news/update detection system: The GH Software Online module provides news and update information from GH Software 
  * Stable: The scanning kernel in NetScanG is split into two units; the scanning engine and a control (watchdog) unit, which ensures that NetScanG always operates. 
  * Runs "out-of-the-box": Once the service part of NetScanG is installed and started, NetScanG runs - no other settings needs to be set up
