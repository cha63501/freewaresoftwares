**Publisher's Description**  
  

WebGrab is an innovative program that will download files from the web in a
very easy and specific way.

The program can be used in two ways:

1) The url of a file to download. This is useful especially with movies or pdf
documents that tend to load in the internet browser rather than being
downloaded. If these files are large enough they may cause irresponsiveness to
the browser. Furthermore this is a means of downloading a file where there is
no such option!

2) The url of an html page that contains numerous links to other files. The
program will parse the page and present the user with a number of files it has
found. Then it will download only the selected ones.

Please keep in mind that parsing an html page may not always be successful.

The program supports drag & drop so downloading a file is as simple as simply
dragging it to WebGrab!
