**Publisher's Description**  
  

NetBrute Scanner is a suite of three valuable network tools and is absolutely
free to use.

NetBrute allows you to scan a single computer or multiple IP addresses for
available Windows File & Print Sharing resources. This is probably one of the
most dangerous and easily exploitable security holes. It is common for your
novice users to have their printers or their entire hard drive shared without
being aware of it. This utility will help you to find these resources, so you
can secure them with a firewall or by informing your users how to properly
configure their shares with tighter security.

PortScan allows you to scan a single computer or multiple IP addresses for
available Internet services. This will allow you to identify which TCP ports
need to be blocked by your firewall, if you wish to secure them. Or it will
allow you to identify unused services that are running, so they can be
stopped.

WebBrute will allow you to scan your web directories that are protected with
HTTP authentication, testing the security strength of your usersA' passwords.
This will allow you to better enforce your password maintenance policies to
ensure that your users are not using easily guessed passwords, or passwords
that match their username.
