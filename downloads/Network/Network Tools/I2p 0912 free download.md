**Publisher's Description**  
  

I2P is an anonymizing network, offering a simple layer that identity-sensitive
applications can use to securely communicate. All data is wrapped with several
layers of encryption, and the network is both distributed and dynamic, with no
trusted parties.

Anonymity is not a boolean - we are not trying to make something "perfectly
anonymous", but instead are working at making attacks more and more expensive
to mount. I2P alone is what could be called a "low latency mix network", and
there are limits to the anonymity offered by such a system, but the
applications on top of I2P, such as Syndie, I2P mail, and I2PSnark extend it
to offer both additional functionality and protection.

I2P is still a work in progress, and should only be used for testing or
development purposes prior to the 1.0 release. Further releases beyond that
will add support for more hostile adversaries.
