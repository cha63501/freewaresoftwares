**Publisher's Description**  
  

IPv6 Subnetting Tool is a handy calculator that network engineers can use to
plan their assigned addresses up to /64 bits. The Internet addressing
structure is transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6, and with this tool, the
engineers can plan their IPv6 subnetting infrastructure accurately and easily.

They will check entered values to determine whether users entered valid IPv6
addresses. If they are valid, they will formalize the addresses into 16 Bytes
hexadecimal values before making necessary calculations.

The IPv6 Subnetting Tool is based on .NET 3.5 Framework and designed using
Visual C# 2008 Express. It helps network engineers in making their subnet
calculations quickly and without errors.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
