**Publisher's Description**  
  

IP->Com allows any of the existing serial (RS232) ports on your PC to
interface directly to a TCP/IP network. This makes it possible for any other
computer on the same network to send and receive serial data through a remote
serial port on the PC where it is running. You connect to the remote serial
port by connecting to a TCP/IP port.
