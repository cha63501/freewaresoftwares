**Publisher's Description**  
  

Kiwi Log Viewer for Windows is a freeware application that displays text based
log files in a tabular format. Only a small section of the file is read from
disk at a time which saves memory and allows you to view a file that would be
too big to fit in memory. The tail option monitors the specified log file for
changes and displays any new data that is added in real time. Features
colorization based on sub-string or RegExp matches
