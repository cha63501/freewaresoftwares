**Publisher's Description**  
  


NetAlive is a tiny application that simply connects to another computer running NetAlive and maintains a direct uninterrupted connection. 

To connect, start NetAlive on your PC and ask a friend to run NetAlive on his PC too. Then enter his IP address in the A'Other PCA' box on NetAlive running in your PC and click on A'ConnectA'. Once connected, NetAlive sends and receives approximately 100 bytes of data per second.

This is not a file sharing tool. It simply connects one PC to another PC running NetAlive by IP addresses via TCP/IP Port 1980.
