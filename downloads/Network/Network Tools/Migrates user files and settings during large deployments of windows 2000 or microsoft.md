**Publisher's Description**  
  


MicrosoftA(r) WindowsA(r) User State Migration Tool (USMT) version 2.6.2 migrates user files and settings during deployments of Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows XP. USMT 2.6.2 provides enterprise migration capabilities such as unattended migration, multi-user profile support and compression. USMT 2.6.2 is intended for administrators who are performing automated deployments. 

This toolkit includes two command-line tools named Scanstate and Loadstate. Scanstate captures an intermediate store with the user files and settings from the source computer. Loadstate restores these files and settings to the destination computer.

USMT 2.6.2 also has five default migration rule (.inf) files named Migapp.inf, Migsys.inf, Miguser.inf, Sysfiles.inf, and ArchiveApp.inf. You can alter the default .inf files and you can create customized .inf files. Depending on what you want to migrate, you can specify all or none of the default .inf files on the command line.

The entire migration process is driven by the .inf rules, which you can modify, and logic that is built-in to the tool. When using USMT for automated migration, in almost all cases you should modify the .inf files to better handle your unique situation.

The only difference between USMT 2.6.1 and USMT 2.6.2 is that this version contains a fix for an issue that occurred with Microsoft Excel. After migrating settings with earlier versions of USMT, users sometimes received an error when opening Excel that a file could not be found. This issue is fixed in USMT 2.6.2.
