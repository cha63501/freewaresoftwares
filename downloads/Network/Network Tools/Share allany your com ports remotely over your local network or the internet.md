**Publisher's Description**  
  


IP->Com allows any of the existing serial (RS232) ports on your PC to interface directly to a TCP/IP network. This makes it possible for any other computer on the same network to send and receive serial data through a remote serial port on the PC where it is running. You connect to the remote serial port by connecting to a TCP/IP port.
