**Publisher's Description**  
  

http-ping is a small, free, easy-to-use command-line utility that probes a
given URL and displays relevant statistics. It is similar to the popular
A'pingA' utility, but works over HTTP instead of ICMP, and with a URL instead
of a computer name/IP address.

Use it to discover if a web site is responding to requests, test the
performance of any web site, or load-test a web server.

http-pingA's simplicity makes it the ideal choice for use in scripts that must
detect if a web server is available and serving pages.

For each request, http-ping displays:

  * The HTTP return code (and its brief description) 
  * The number of bytes returned by the server (excluding headers) 
  * The time taken to complete the request (i.e. round-trip time) 
A summary of all the requests is presented upon completion.

**What's New in version 3.2.8.15:**

  * Added the option for a timeout (-w).
