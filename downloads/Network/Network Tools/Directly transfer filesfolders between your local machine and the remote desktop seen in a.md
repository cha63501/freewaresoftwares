**Publisher's Description**  
  


Zipboard lets you copy files and folders across locations that may not be inter-accessible via the file system but that do share the clipboard, such as A'Remote DesktopsA' connected via A'Terminal ServicesA'. 

Using Zipboard, you can directly transfer files between your local machine and the A'remote desktopA' seen in a A'terminal clientA', without needing to access the remote machine as a network drive on your LAN.

To effect a copy-paste operation across remote desktops, Zipboard needs to be installed on both - the local and remote machines. Files/folders from either location can be copied using the A'Send To > ZipboardA' menu command, or by dragging them onto a A'drop targetA' icon. These can then be pasted at the other end using the A'New > Zipboard TargetA' or A'Paste from ZipboardA' menu commands. You can also copy/paste by running Zipboard from a command-prompt with appropriate parameters.
