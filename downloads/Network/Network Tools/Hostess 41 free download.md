**Publisher's Description**  
  

Hostess is a free utility for maintaining your Hosts file. To learn more about
using the Hosts file and how it works, please see the Links section below for
some sites with great information. The documentation included with Hostess can
give you a general overview of how the Hosts file works as well.

Unlike many Hosts utilities, Hostess is geared towards ad-blocking rather than
IP address resolution. Hostess stores your host entries in a database that is
indexed to eliminate duplicates and make searching fast and easy. It also
allows you to group these hosts for efficiency and ease of maintenance.

Installing the program is also easy: just create a directory, unzip
hostess.zip into it and create a shortcut to hostess.exe. No registry changes
are made, and any program settings are stored in an INI file in the program
directory.

**What's New in version 4.1:**

  * Hostess now supports imports and exports in plain text format! The command line options were reworked to allow for the new features, and the menu shortcuts were updated so they don't conflict with common text editing shortcuts like Ctrl-V for Paste.
