**Publisher's Description**  
  

To monitor over a thousand different hosts would be extremely costly, even for
the simplest programs. I was able to use this program to accurately monitor
the status of switches, routers, servers, and VIP end users for free.

**Features:**

  * No need to install. It can even be from a Flash Drive/ Pen Drive
  * It can easily be used to monitor any number of machines. I use it to monitor over 1000 devices. It even sometimes beats the paid for tools that my company uses for alerting network outages.
  * Simple to configure. Just enter the hosts to be monitored in the text file and click the pingsweeper.exe file.
  * Completely free. The program costs nothing. This is the full version.
