**Publisher's Description**  
  

Dual mode packet analyzer.

Mode 1 (Packet interceptor)  
Receive and analyze IP packets from your network or the internet. Analyze only
the packets of interest to you by way of filtering; this filtering may be done
by IP address, port, packet size, protocol, or sub-string searching of packet
content. Also, you can search for a sub-string within the current list of
packets, save the list of packets to a text file, view the contents of each
packet, and more.

Mode 2 (HTTP file interceptor)  
This mode collects packets of the HTTP protocol, analyzes the packets,
constructs them into usable files, and then automatically saves these files to
a user specified directory. These files may be web-pages, pictures, videos,
downloads, and more. You may filter the saving of files by IP address, port,
and/or file size.

Both modes have easy to use interfaces, while maintaining the ability to
customize.

This is a great tool for network administrators, security professionals, and
just about any advanced computer user with an internet connection.
