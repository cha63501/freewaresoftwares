**Publisher's Description**  
  

VoIP NetworkTester is a free tool which enables you to measure quality of your
VoIP network. It allows you to generate bidirectional UDP streams with a set
packet size and bandwidth. Measures RTP jitter, delays, bandwidth.

VoIP call is usually established using a SIP session with a bidirectional RTP
stream. SIP and RTP protocols are based on UDP transport protocol. UDP uses a
simple transmission model without implicit reliability, ordering and data
integrity. Each single UDP packet is transferred independently. The quality of
a SIP call depends on delays and loss of IP packets in a network. Long delays
lead to large RTP jitter and bad sound quality of a VoIP call.

NetworkTester allows you to generate bidirectional UDP streams with a set
packet size and bandwidth and measure following:

  * Percentage of lost UDP packets 
  * Maximum and average of jitter time 
  * Jitter delay distribution view 
  * Winsockets WSASendTo() procedure execution delays 
  * VoIP network max bandwidth for a specified jitter.
