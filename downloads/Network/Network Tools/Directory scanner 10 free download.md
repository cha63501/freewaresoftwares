**Publisher's Description**  
  

Directory Scanner is a free Directory Server fingerprinting tool. It can help
you to remotely detect the type of Directory servers (such as Microsoft Active
Directory, Novell eDirectory etc) running on the local network as well as
Internet.

Also it can be used in penetration testing while evaluating client
environments where multiple Directory servers are deployed. Directory servers
are typically used to store crucial data in an organization including employee
authentication information. Often getting hold of poorly configured Directory
server can be a gold mine for the pentester.

In addition to this, it can greatly help administrators to remotely keep tab
on Directory Servers running in their network. At a time you can use it to
scan single or multiple systems in the network.

It can detect following popular Directory Servers:

  * Novell eDirectory 
  * Microsoft Active Directory 
  * Open LDAP Directory 
  * Sun One Directory 
  * Netscape Directory 
  * IBM Lotus Domino 
  * Oracle Directory 
It comes with Installer which helps in local installation & un-installation of
the tool. It works on wide range of platforms starting from Windows XP to
latest operating system Windows7.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes a toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.
