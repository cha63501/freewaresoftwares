**Publisher's Description**  
  

If a network outage is detected, it will alert you via email. This is the main
functionality most people are looking for when they spend thousands of dollars
on commercial network monitoring software. Why waste money? This is free. It
has been greatly improved to greatly reduce false positives. It really is a
first class network monitoring solution.

**Instructions (Important):**

  * You need to open the alarm.vbs file and change the From and TO lines to the email addresses you want to use for the alerts. 
  * Next you need to find the line with "smtp.email.com" and change this to your smtp server. Save and close this file. 
  * Open the iplist.txt and add the hosts you wish to be monitored. Comments are allowed by adding a space and then the comment after the hostname or ip address. Examples are included. Save your changes and close this file. 
  * Run pingsweeper. It is a ghost application so you should not see anything. It will silently work in the background until there is an outage. If an outage is detected it will launch the emails. 
  * Not sure if its working? Check your Task Manager and you should see your ping.exe hard at work. 
  * To close the program, open the task manager and close the cmd.exe process.
