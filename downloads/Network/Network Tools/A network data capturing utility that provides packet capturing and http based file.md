**Publisher's Description**  
  


NetworkActiv PIAFCTM is a network data capturing utility that provides both packet capturing and HTTP (Web) based file capturing. This can allow you to see the data coming in from- and going out to- your computer, such as instant messages, e-mails, and Web pages. With the built-in HTTP file decoding system, you can capture and save Web page files that are transferred (which happens when you load a page). These files can include the HTML and other text, as well as the pictures and flash videos. PIAFCTM is stand-alone and does not require any third-party components. 

Notice: Since this software can be used to capture Web page files and other network traffic, be sure to take care to follow copyright and other laws and also to use the software morally.

**Features:**

  * HTTP (Web) based file capturing and saving. 
  * Packet capturing with standard protocol decoding. 
  * Packet statistics collection (via the built-in "Statistical Mode"). 
  * Ability to filter the capturing, to help in focusing on desired data.
