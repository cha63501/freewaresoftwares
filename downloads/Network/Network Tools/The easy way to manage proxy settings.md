**Publisher's Description**  
  


The free NPM Lite version has been developed for individuals that find themselves constantly changing Internet settings to access the internet. With NPM 2014 Lite you can create network profiles that match your frequently used locations (home, work and your favourite cafe) so that as soon as you are there, the right Internet Settings will be applied; just open the lid and surf. 

NPM 2014 Lite works with all recent versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Opera. You can easily create using a query based on (DNS suffix, IP Address or SSID for example) to identify each network connection. When your computer connects to a new network, NPM qualifies each profile against the connection in priority order (top down) until a match is found. If no match is found the default A'Unknown NetworkA' profile is used. Having identified the profile, NPM 2014 Lite changes your browser and proxy settings using the actions you have defined in that profile.
