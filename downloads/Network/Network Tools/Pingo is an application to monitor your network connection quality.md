**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pingo is an application to monitor your network connection quality. It does this by pinging user-defined hosts with desired interval. All status changes are written to logfiles which are plain text. Later on I will provide an analyzer or you can build it by yourself quite easily. 

If youA're struggling with lots of downtime of your ADSL/cable-modem etc. connection, this is a software worth running to get proofment of the "quality" of your connection. The program takes only ~2mb of memory and causes no CPU load at all. It requires only one EXE file so itA's really simple and plain.
