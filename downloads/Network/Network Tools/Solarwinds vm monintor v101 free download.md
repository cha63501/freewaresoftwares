While virtualization has tremendous benefits, it adds new complexity when it
comes to managing your network. Virtual machines (VMs) and their host ESX

server counterparts. Your users donA't care if their apps are running on
physical servers or in virtual environments - they just want great
performance. ThatA's why we came up with an easy-to-use tool to keep a
vigilant eye on virtualization health - and itA's FREE!
