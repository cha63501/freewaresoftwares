**Publisher's Description**  
  


DomainHostingView is a utility for Windows that collects extensive information about a domain by using a series of DNS and WHOIS queries, and generates HTML report that can be displayed in any Web browser. 

The information displayed by the report of DomainHostingView includes: the hosting company or data center that hosts the Web server, mail server, and domain name server (DNS) of the specified domain, the created/changed/expire date of the domain, domain owner, domain registrar that registered the domain, list of all DNS records, and more... 

**Features:**

  * DomainHostingView is a Unicode application and this it can display properly WHOIS records containing non-English characters. 
  * DomainHostingView supports Internationalized domain names (IDN). When you type a domain with non-English characters, DomainHostingView automatically converts it into a format that can be used in the WHOIS and DNS servers. 
  * DomainHostingView parses the text returned by the WHOIS servers, extracts the important data, and displays it in easy-to-read summary. 
  * DomainHostingView also displays the raw text returned by the WHOIS servers, with a small enhancement - every http link is displayed as clickable link that opens the Web page in a new window. 

**System Requirements:**

  * This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows XP and up to Windows 7/2008, including x64 versions of Windows. This utility also works on Windows 2000, but without the IDN support. 
  * Firewall/router requirements: You should allow DomainHostingView to connect the following outgoing TCP/UDP ports: 43 (WHOIS), 53 (DNS), 80 (HTTP), and 25 (SMTP). 
  * The report created by DomainHostingView is based on the information provided by public WHOIS servers. If WHOIS server is temporary down, some information wonA't be displayed in the report. Also, some WHOIS servers may block your IP address if you use DomainHostingView to get reports about many domains in short period of time. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.59:**

  * Added the WHOIS server of .ac.uk domains.
