**Publisher's Description**  
  


FastResolver is a small utility that resolves multiple host names into IP addresses and vice versa. You can simply type the list of IP addresses or host name that you want to resolve, or alternatively, you can specify IP addresses range that you want to scan. 

For local network, FastResolver also allows you to get the MAC address of all IP addresses that you scan. FastResolver is a multithreaded application, so it can resolve dozens of addresses within a few seconds.

Be aware that resolving IP address to host name doesnA't work well under Windows 98/ME. 

Starting from version 1.20, FastResolver allows you to view the company name of each MAC address. However, in order to get this feature, you must download the following external file, and put in the same folder of FastResolver.exe: <http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt>  
Be aware that you must save it as 'oui.txt'

**What's New in version 1.25:**

  * Added 'MAC Address Format' option (XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX, XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, or XXXXXXXXXXXX).
