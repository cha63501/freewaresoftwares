IPNetInfo is a small utility that allows you to easily find all available information about an IP address: The owner of the IP address, the country/state name, IP addresses range, contact information (address, phone, fax, and email), and more.

IPNetInfo automatically extracts all IP addresses from the message headers, and displays the information about these IP addresses.
