**Publisher's Description**  
  

Angry IP scanner is a very fast IP address and port scanner.

Angry IP scanner simply pings each IP address to check if it's alive, then
optionally it is resolving its hostname, determines the MAC address, scans
ports, etc. The amount of gathered data about each host can be extended with
plugins.

It also has additional features, like NetBIOS information (computer name,
workgroup name, and currently logged in Windows user), favorite IP address
ranges, web server detection, customizable openers, etc.

Scanning results can be saved to CSV, TXT, XML or IP-Port list files. With
help of plugins, Angry IP Scanner can gather any information about scanned
IPs. Anybody who can write Java code is able to write plugins and extend
functionality of Angry IP Scanner.

In order to increase scanning speed, it uses multithreaded approach: a
separate scanning thread is created for each scanned IP address.
