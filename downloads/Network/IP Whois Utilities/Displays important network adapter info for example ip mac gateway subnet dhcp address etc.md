**Publisher's Description**  
  


Network Info is a small tool which displays important data of all network adapters that are connected to the computer (e.g. modem, DSL, LAN). The handling of the program is easy and intuitive. Data that are displayed are for example the IP-address, MAC-address, subnet mask and the address of the DHCP-server. 

If you click the Tray-button on the caption, the program minimizes to the system tray. Now the tooltip of the icon in the system tray shows the IP- and gateway-address of the network adapter that was displayed at last.

New in Version 1.5: Differentiation between private and public IPs. The current Internet IP can be determined. So far there was no way to get this IP if your machine was behind a router or a proxy server. Furthermore a help was integrated that can be activated by hitting the F1 key.
