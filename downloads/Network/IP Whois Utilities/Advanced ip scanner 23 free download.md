**Publisher's Description**  
  

Advanced IP Scanner is a free, fast and powerful network scanner with a user-
friendly interface. In a matter of seconds, Advanced IP Scanner can locate all
the computers on your wired or wireless local network and conduct a scan of
their ports. The program provides easy access to various network resources,
such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and shared folders. It also enables you to detect all
the IP addresses on your Wi-Fi network.

The remote PC shutdown feature lets you shut down any remote computer or group
of computers running Windows. You can also wake these machines up remotely
using Advanced IP Scanner, if their network cards support the Wake-On-LAN
function.

Advanced IP Scanner and Radmin remote control software are deeply integrated.
IP Scanner lets you scan your network, find all computers running Radmin
Server, and connect to any one of them with one click. The free Radmin Viewer
needs to be installed on your PC for you to access a remote machine running
Radmin Server. With Radmin, you can access the remote PC in Full Control, File
Transfer, and Telnet modes. For simpler batch operations on a subset of
computers, you can add machines to a list of Favorites.

Advanced IP Scanner will automatically load the list at startup. You can
choose whether to scan your entire network or just the computers in Favorites
list. You are also able to save your Favorites list for scanning purposes and
other operations.
