**Publisher's Description**  
  


Advanced IP Scanner is a free, fast and powerful network scanner with a user-friendly interface. In a matter of seconds, Advanced IP Scanner can locate all the computers on your wired or wireless local network and conduct a scan of their ports. The program provides easy access to various network resources, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and shared folders. It also enables you to detect all the IP addresses on your Wi-Fi network. 

The remote PC shutdown feature lets you shut down any remote computer or group of computers running Windows. You can also wake these machines up remotely using Advanced IP Scanner, if their network cards support the Wake-On-LAN function. 

Advanced IP Scanner and Radmin remote control software are deeply integrated. IP Scanner lets you scan your network, find all computers running Radmin Server, and connect to any one of them with one click. The free Radmin Viewer needs to be installed on your PC for you to access a remote machine running Radmin Server. With Radmin, you can access the remote PC in Full Control, File Transfer, and Telnet modes. For simpler batch operations on a subset of computers, you can add machines to a list of Favorites. 

Advanced IP Scanner will automatically load the list at startup. You can choose whether to scan your entire network or just the computers in Favorites list. You are also able to save your Favorites list for scanning purposes and other operations.

**WhatA's new in version 2.3:**

  * Runs ping, tracert and SSH commands on a selected computer. 
  * The program can be launched directly from the installer with no manual installation required. 
  * New languages (Chinese, Japanese) have been added.
