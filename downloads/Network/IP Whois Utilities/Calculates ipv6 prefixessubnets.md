**Publisher's Description**  
  


Many new IP Address Management products are incapable of generating lists of IPv6 subnets for networks given the vast lists they could emit. This reduces visibility for administrators forcing them to visualize network and subnet breakdowns using other methods. 

IPv6 Subnet Calculator generates these lists to aid in IP Address Management. Administrators can select a network and subnet prefix and generate a list of valid subnets. Selected subnets from the list can be copied to the Windows clipboard making them available to other applications.
