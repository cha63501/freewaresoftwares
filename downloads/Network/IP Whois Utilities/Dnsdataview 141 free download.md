**Publisher's Description**  
  

This utility is a GUI alternative to the NSLookup tool that comes with Windows
operating system. It allows you to easily retrieve the DNS records (MX, NS, A,
SOA) of the specified domains.

You can use the default DNS server of your Internet connection, or use any
other DNS server that you specify. After retrieving the DNS records for the
desired domains, you can save them into text/xml/html/csv file.

**WhatA's New in version 1.41:**

  * Fixed the resizing problems of the 'Select Domains' window - some fields remained in their position instead of moving. 
  * DNSDataView now remembers that last size and position of the 'Select Domains' window. 
  * Fixed the tab order of the 'Select Domains' window.
