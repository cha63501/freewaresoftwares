**Publisher's Description**  
  

Many new IP Address Management products are incapable of generating lists of
IPv6 subnets for networks given the vast lists they could emit. This reduces
visibility for administrators forcing them to visualize network and subnet
breakdowns using other methods.

IPv6 Subnet Calculator generates these lists to aid in IP Address Management.
Administrators can select a network and subnet prefix and generate a list of
valid subnets. Selected subnets from the list can be copied to the Windows
clipboard making them available to other applications.
