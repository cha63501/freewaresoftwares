**Publisher's Description**  
  

RandScan Free v1.1 Stealth multi-function port scanner.

**Features:**

  * Stealth scan by generating random IP addresses in a user-specified range. 
  * Stealth scan by incrementing the IP address (a.b.c.d) in **reverse** order (increment aA's, then bA's, etc). 
  * Scan a list of addresses from an input file or a single remote host. 
  * Automatically look up host names for connected ports. 
  * Select number of sockets in multi-socket data collection. 
  * Five different logs of results to files for later analysis: 
    1. Session data 
    2. Found Hosts 
    3. Connection Transcript 
    4. Events & Errors 
    5. Refused Connections 
  * _ONLY_ from Global Services, a NEW Filter function to more than double the speed of finding remote hosts. 
And RandScan does not "invade" your computer -- no changes to your registry,
no files in your Windows directory. Unbelievable, but true: "RandScan rocks."

NEW...protocol-specific probes added for ports 53, 113, 443, 1080 and 1433 and
command-line arguments to run from .bat file.

Note: The download link provided redirects to the developerA's page. You can
download the file directly from there.
