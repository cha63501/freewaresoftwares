**Publisher's Description**  
  

IP Monitor is a program designed to check your public IP for changes and
notify you in several ways such as playing a sound file, sending an email,
displaying a visual notification (if supported by platform) or executing a
command. Under Windows, IP Monitor can be run as a service and under Linux it
can be run as daemon.

It also doesnA't mess with the Windows Registry nor System folders, which
