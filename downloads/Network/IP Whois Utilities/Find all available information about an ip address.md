**Publisher's Description**  
  


IP Locator is a small utility that allows you to easily find all available information about an IP address: The owner of the IP address, the country/state name, IP addresses range, contact information (address, phone, fax, and email), and more. 

With IP locator you can track IP address hosts. The program uses an accurate IP address location database to determine any IP address location. Moreover you will find out the ISP.

The IP address information is retrieved by sending a request to the whois server of to the whois server of ARIN. If ARIN doesnAt maintain the information about the requested IP address, a second request is sent to the whois server of RIPE, APNIC, LACNIC or AfriNIC.
