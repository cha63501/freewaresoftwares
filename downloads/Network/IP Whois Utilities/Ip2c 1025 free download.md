**Publisher's Description**  
  

ip2c (ip to country) is a program written to determine the country associated
to a specific IP address.

The program queries the five main whois servers responsible for each region of
the world and try to automatically establish the most authoritative for the IP
specified. Then it return the countryA's two-letter TLD (for example US), the
extended country name (for example United States of America), its world region
(for example North America) and a string containing a brief description of the
organization managing the block of IP addresses containing the submitted IP
(when available).

The program can also process a list of IPs stored in a comma delimited file
and generate a new file with the country fields added to it.

ip2c is a multithreaded application, and queries all the servers in parallel
to minimize the overall response time. ip2c is distributed as a console (or
command line) application (ip2c.exe) and a Windows GUI application
(ip2c_gui.exe). The features of the two versions are somewhat different and
examined in more detail in the help file.

**WhatA's new in version 1.0.25:**

  * Fix for some IP ranges allocated to LACNIC.
