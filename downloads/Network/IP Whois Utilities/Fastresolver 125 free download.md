**Publisher's Description**  
  

FastResolver is a small utility that resolves multiple host names into IP
addresses and vice versa. You can simply type the list of IP addresses or host
name that you want to resolve, or alternatively, you can specify IP addresses
range that you want to scan.

For local network, FastResolver also allows you to get the MAC address of all
IP addresses that you scan. FastResolver is a multithreaded application, so it
can resolve dozens of addresses within a few seconds.

Be aware that resolving IP address to host name doesnA't work well under
Windows 98/ME.

Starting from version 1.20, FastResolver allows you to view the company name
of each MAC address. However, in order to get this feature, you must download
the following external file, and put in the same folder of FastResolver.exe:
<http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt>  
Be aware that you must save it as 'oui.txt'

**What's New in version 1.25:**

  * Added 'MAC Address Format' option (XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX, XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, or XXXXXXXXXXXX).
