**Publisher's Description**  
  


Termite is an easy to use and easy to configure RS232 terminal. It uses an interface similar to that of "messenger" or "chat" programs, with a large window that contains all received data and an edit line for typing in strings to transmit. Highlights of the utility are the ease of installation (possibly with pre-configured settings) using a heuristic search for the appropriate COM port and, as was mentioned, its user-friendliness. 

**Features:**

  * Plug-in interface for pre-processing or alternative views of the data, logging received data to a file, adding a toolbar to Termite, and other functionality that you may think of. 
  * A history of commands that you typed, with auto-completion. 
  * Resizeable main window, with a "keep window on top" option. 
  * Ability to run with pre-configured settings from a read-only medium (no installation is necessary). 
  * Support for non-standard Baud rates (MIDI, DMX512). 
  * Different colouring for transmitted and received data (blue=transmitted, green=received). 
  * Data can be forwarded between two RS232 ports. 
  * Search dialog for transmitted/received text (right-click pop-up menu). 
  * Save or print the contents of the transmitted/received text (right-click pop-up menu).
