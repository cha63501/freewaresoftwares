**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tunnelier is a fast, robust, easy to use SSH client for Windows with flexible
TCP/IP tunneling support. Tunnelier incorporates an FTP-to-SFTP bridge which
performs translation between the FTP and SFTP protocols, allowing any FTP
client application to connect securely to an SFTP server through Tunnelier.

Both active mode and passive mode FTP data connections are supported, as well
as restarted transfers, directory listings and other features.

All FTP clients should be able to list directories and transfer files across
TunnelierA's FTP-to-SFTP bridge, including integrated clients in applications
such as Dreamweaver, GUI clients such as BulletProof FTP, and command line
clients such as the default ftp.exe client accompanying Windows.

**Tunnelier:**

  * powerful SSH port forwarding capabilities, including dynamic forwarding through integrated SOCKS and HTTP CONNECT proxy; 
  * support for RSA and DSA public key authentication with comprehensive user keypair management; 
  * state-of-the-art terminal emulation with support for the bvterm, xterm, and vt100 protocols; 
  * one of the most advanced graphical SFTP clients; 
  * an advanced command-line SFTP client; 
  * an FTP-to-SFTP bridge allowing you to connect to an SFTP server using legacy FTP applications; 
  * WinSSHD remote administration features; 
  * single-click Remote Desktop forwarding. 
Tunnelier is free for individual use, as well as for limited use inside
organizations! To begin, simply download the installation executable. Check
the Tunnelier license to see if you can use it free of charge or whether a
right of use needs to be purchased for your environment.

**What's New in version 4.40:**

  * Tunnelier now includes the WinSSHD Remote Control Panel for WinSSHD versions 5.22 and newer. WinSSHD Remote Control Panel versions 5.06+, 5.11+, and 5.18+ also continue to be included. 
  * Fixed issue introduced in version 4.39 that prevented Tunnelier from functioning correctly when used with the -noRegistry setting. 
  * Fixed issue where the Tunnelier graphical SFTP interface would fail to list a drive that was completely empty of all directory entries (did not even contain the default '.' or '..' entries).
