**Publisher's Description**  
  

Utilities like Telnet and remote control programs like SymantecA's PC Anywhere
let you execute programs on remote systems, but they can be a pain to set up
and require that you install client software on the remote systems that you
wish to access. PsExec is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you
execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for
console applications, without having to manually install client software.
PsExecA's most powerful uses include launching interactive command-prompts on
remote systems and remote-enabling tools like IpConfig that otherwise do not
have the ability to show information about remote systems.

**Installation**  
Just copy PsExec onto your executable path. Typing "psexec" displays its usage
syntax.

**What's New in version 2.1:**

  * This update to PsExec, a command-line utility that enables you to execute programs on remote systems without preinstalling an agent, encrypts all communication between local and remote systems, including the transmission of command information such as the user name and password under which the remote program executes.
