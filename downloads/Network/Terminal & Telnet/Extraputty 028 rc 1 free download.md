**Publisher's Description**  
  

ExtraPuTTY is a handy application that lets programs send and receive data
easily over a variety of protocols and generate different reports. The
application includes all the features found in the original PuTTY and adds
others in addition to fixing some bugs. In addition to using Telnet and SSH
like PuTTY, ExtraPuTTY also supports Raw and Rlogin protocols.

You can display the applicationAs main window attached to the xterm terminal
emulator or just next to it. This makes it easy to access the emulatorAs
options. You can reveal the system menu easily or use full-screen mode. You
can also customize connections and sessions to suit your project. Since you
save your sessions as files, you do not interfere with the registry.

ExtraPuTTY is easier to use, and it completes processes faster because you can
automate the operations requiring logging in with Lua scripts. Its tracing
function allows you to monitor both sent commands and received responses. You
can then generate a comprehensive HTML report.

ExtraPuTTY includes an application known as FTPLoader, which allows you to
transfer files among computers without using the SSH protocol.

The extra features that ExtraPuTTY provides make it easy to use so you can
increase your workflow.
