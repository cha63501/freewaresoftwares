**Publisher's Description**  
  

EasyMTU is a free utility that optimizes your TCP/IP settings for your dial-up
adapter (MaxMTU, MaxMSS, DefaultTTL, and more). Windows has default settings
for TCP/IP that are not optimal for your modem, with packet sizes that result
in a slowed-down Internet connection. These settings are stored in the
registry and can be modified, only it is difficult to find the right key to
modify. EasyMTU searches for the TCP/IP protocol binded to your dial-up
adapter and changes only these settings, so other elements of your registry
(like your network adapter) are unaltered.
