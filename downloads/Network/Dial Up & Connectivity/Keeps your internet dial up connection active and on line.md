**Publisher's Description**  
  


Does your Internet Service Provider drop your dial-up connection after what seems like only nanoseconds of account inactivity? 

Stay Live 2000 keeps your Internet Dial-Up Connection active and on-line by periodically sending a small TCP/IP packet to one of the many Atomic Clocks maintained by the United States Government.

Sending these small packets prevents your ISP from dropping your connection due to inactivity.

You may also optionally select to have your computerA's internal real-time clock updated each time one of these packets is sent and a response is returned from an NIST Time Server.

You can use this utility in one of two ways. Either run your web browser or other Internet software and then launch Stay Live to keep your connection active, or launch Stay Live first to establish an Internet connection and then run your web browser or other software.
