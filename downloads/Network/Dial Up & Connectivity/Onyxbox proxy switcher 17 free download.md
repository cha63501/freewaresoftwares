**Publisher's Description**  
  

Proxy Switcher is a small tray icon type utility that allows you to select
whether Windows and Mozilla Firefox should use a proxy server for Internet
access in a couple of clicks.

No more digging around in the Internet Options screen for Windows or the
Advanced tab in Firefox. Simply right click on the tray icon and choose
A'HomeA' for a direct connection to the Internet or A'OfficeA' to use the
proxy, there is even an A'AutoA' option which will change the setting for you
when you connect to your work/home or work VPN network.

Proxy Switcher even informs your Windows environment of the changes so you
donA't need to restart applications such as Internet Explorer or MSN Messenger
when the proxy settings change.
