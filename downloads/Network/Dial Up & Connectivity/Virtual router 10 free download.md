**Publisher's Description**  
  

Virtual Router is a free, open source software based router for PCs running
Windows 8, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

Using Virtual Router, users can wirelessly share any internet connection
(Wifi, LAN, Cable Modem, Dial-up, Cellular, etc.) with any Wifi device
(Laptop, Smart Phone, iPod Touch, iPhone, Android Phone, Zune, Netbook,
wireless printer, etc.)

These devices connect to Virtual Router just like any other access point, and
the connection is completely secured using WPA2 (the most secure wireless
encryption.)

The Wireless Network create/shared with Virtual Router uses WPA2 Encryption,
and there is not way to turn off that encryption. This is actually a feature
of the Wireless Hosted Network APIs built into Windows 7 and 2008 R2 to ensure
the best security possible.

You can give your "virtual" wireless network any name you want, and also set
the password to anything. Just make sure the password is at least 8
characters.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
