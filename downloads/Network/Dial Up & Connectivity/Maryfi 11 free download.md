**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free and easy to use software router for Windows 7 computers. With Maryfi,
users can wirelessly share any Internet connection: a cable modem, a cellular
card, or even another Wi-Fi network. Other Wi-Fi enabled devices including
laptops, smart phones, music players, and gaming systems can see and join your
Maryfi hotspot just like any other Wi-Fi access point and are kept safe and
secure by password-protected WPA2 Encryption.

**Popular Use Cases**

At Home  
Maryfi can easily act as a repeater for your home router, extending its range
and providing Internet access wherever you need it. Connect to your home
network, apply sharing settings to your home network, enter the same Wi-Fi
name and password, and hit "Start Hotspot." Devices will automatically connect
to the Internet through either your Maryfi hotspot or home router depending on
proximity. you can finally have Internet access in that impossible back room
or basement. In addition, if you run Maryfi away from home with these
settings, any devices that need to be bound to a specific network (such as
Eye-Fi cards or wireless printers) will work flawlessly with no additional
configuration no matter where you are!

At Office or on the Road  
Internet connectivity is a lifeline. Airports, Hotels, and Coffee Shops know
this and charge accordingly, often as much as $10-$15 a day, per connection!
These fees can quickly add up when traveling with friends or co-workers. The
handful of hotels that provide free Internet access occasionally only supply
you with an Ethernet jack, which leaves Wi-Fi only devices and smart phones in
the dark. Even the lucky few that have mobile 3G cards or adapters are limited
to a single connection. Because Maryfi is free to download and use, users can
save money on multiple Wi-Fi connections while on the road and still get all
their devices online simultaneously.

Offline Networking  
Even without an active Internet connection, you can still run a Maryfi
hotspot. This provides wireless access to shared folders or drives on your
network as well as the ability to play LAN games with others. Maryfi works
with new Windows 7 logo-tested Wi-Fi devices,you need to download and install
Microsoft Virtual Wi-Fi Miniport Adapter.

**System Requirements:**  

  * Maryfi works with new Windows 7 logo-tested Wi-Fi devices, and many older devices that have compatible Windows 7 drivers ([Supported Devices](http://www.maryfi.com/devices.php)).
