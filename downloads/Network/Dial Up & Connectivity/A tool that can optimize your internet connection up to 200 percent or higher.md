**Publisher's Description**  
  


NETEagle is a tool that optimizes your modem connection. Your internet connection can be optimized up to 200% or higher by using NETEagle. NETEagle also makes your dial-up connection more stable and more resistant to hang-upAs and disconnects. This means you can download and surf the internet faster than ever before. NETEagle supports all current Windows versions (i.e. Windows 95/98/98SE/ME/2000/XP/2003/Vista), and works with any internet connection like 14.4/28.8/33.6/56 Kb, ISDN, cable, DSL, ADSL, LAN, wireless and satellite modems. No installation or modification needs to be made to your hardware. 

NETEagle optimizes Internet/Network related settings on your end of the connection (your PC) as well as several configuration files. However, those are not the only changes made to your computer. NETEagle also allocates a small portion of your computerA's memory to the processor to process data coming from and to your modem allowing for faster throughput. NETEagle has been tried and tested on numerous machines and has been found to work over 99% of the time. Increase your download speeds and stop dealing with slow internet connections when playing online games, streaming music, audio and video with NETEagle.

NETEagle is quite easy to use and understand. With a few mouse button clicks and setting changes the application is ready to work. After the settings have been made, you will need to reboot your computer and your computerA's modem will be ready to use at optimal performance. Note that it is a program that optimizes your end of the connection, and you will still be dependent on the feed that your ISP provides.
