At Home  
Maryfi can easily act as a repeater for your home router, extending its range and providing Internet access wherever you need it. Connect to your home network, apply sharing settings to your home network, enter the same Wi-Fi name and password, and hit "Start Hotspot." Devices will automatically connect to the Internet through either your Maryfi hotspot or home router depending on proximity. you can finally have Internet access in that impossible back room or basement. In addition, if you run Maryfi away from home with these settings, any devices that need to be bound to a specific network (such as Eye-Fi cards or wireless printers) will work flawlessly with no additional configuration no matter where you are!

At Office or on the Road  
Internet connectivity is a lifeline. Airports, Hotels, and Coffee Shops know this and charge accordingly, often as much as $10-$15 a day, per connection! These fees can quickly add up when traveling with friends or co-workers. The handful of hotels that provide free Internet access occasionally only supply you with an Ethernet jack, which leaves Wi-Fi only devices and smart phones in the dark. Even the lucky few that have mobile 3G cards or adapters are limited to a single connection. Because Maryfi is free to download and use, users can save money on multiple Wi-Fi connections while on the road and still get all their devices online simultaneously.

This provides wireless access to shared folders or drives on your network as well as the ability to play LAN games with others.
