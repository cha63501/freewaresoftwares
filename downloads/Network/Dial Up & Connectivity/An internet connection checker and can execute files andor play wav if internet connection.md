**Consider a scenario:**

You start the recent blockbuster torrent and after seeing the 200 kBps speed, you happily engage in some other task, trying to pass the 1 hour download time. 

After that 1 hour you joyfully turn your monitor on (which you turned off to save power!) to find the movie ready but instead you find that just 5 mins after the starting of the download, your internet connection betrayed you. You check the modem, but its running fine. Some mysterious power disconnected your internet. 

You became quite angry. The pizza and coke you ordered are useless now. Just then your cell phone rings. Its your best friend. She asks you something and you yell at her for no reason. And she stops talking with you.

Heres the output: No movie to watch.  
Pizza and coke: unattended at a corner of your room.  
Best friend doesnA't want to talk to you.  
(Extreme case: Your monitorA's screen has a rod through the screen.)

Why all this happened? Because of that net connection.

How to avoid this problem?

Use NetSNSOR!  
It checks for internet connection after every pre-set interval and if the connection is not found then it alerts you by playing a WAV file or it can start you internet connection also if you have a bacth file.

Its a run-it-and-forget-it kind of software. It writes a log of all the activity so you know what happened at what time!
