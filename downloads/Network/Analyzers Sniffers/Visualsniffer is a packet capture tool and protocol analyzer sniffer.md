**Publisher's Description**  
  


VisualSniffer is a powerful packet capture tool and protocol analyzer (ip sniffer or packet sniffer) for Windows system. VisualSniffer can be used by LAN administrators, and security professionals for network monitoring, intrusion detection, and network traffic logging. It can also be used by network programmers for checking what the developing program has sent and received, or others to get a full picture of the network traffic. 

For example, parents may want to know what kids are doing online. If you stored important data in your PC, you may need to detect whether your data is sending out by some "Adware" or "Spyware". If you are a student, you may want to know how your network is working and the mechanism of each network protocol. VisualSniffer is free software, available with full source code under the terms of the BSD License.
