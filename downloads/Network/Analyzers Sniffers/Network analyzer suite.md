Network-I comprises a very fast sniffer and a suite of tools to process the captured packets - from straightforward display of packet contents, to traffic measurement and analysis of retransmissions and losses.  
  
It can also import and export capture files in _tcpdump_ and _snoop_ formats.  
  
Ideal for a troubleshooting network admin, or developers who want to debug the packets exchanged by their application.  
  
This package is available as pre-built Linux and Solaris packages (2 of each), for easy installation (and uninstalls).
