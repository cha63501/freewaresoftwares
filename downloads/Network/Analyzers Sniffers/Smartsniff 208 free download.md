**Publisher's Description**  
  

SmartSniff allows you to capture TCP/IP packets that pass through your network
adapter, and view the captured data as a sequence of conversations between
clients and servers. You can view the TCP/IP conversations in Ascii mode (for
text-based protocols, like HTTP, SMTP, POP3 and FTP.) or as hex dump. (for
non-text base protocols, like DNS)

**System Requirements:**

SmartSniff can capture TCP/IP packets on any 32-bit Windows operating system
(Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7) as long as [WinPcap capture
driver](http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm) is installed and works
properly with your network adapter.

Under Windows 2000/XP (or greater), SmartSniff also allows you to capture
TCP/IP packets without installing any capture driver, by using 'Raw Sockets'
method. However, this capture method has some limitations and problems:

  * Outgoing UDP and ICMP packets are not captured. 
  * On Windows XP SP1 outgoing packets are not captured at all - Thanks to Microsoft's bug that appeared in SP1 update... This bug was fixed on SP2 update, but under Vista, Microsoft returned back the outgoing packets bug of XP/SP1. 
  * On Windows Vista with SP1, only UDP packets are captured. TCP packets are not captured at all. 
  * On Windows 7, it seems that 'Raw Sockets' method works properly again, at least for now... 

**WhatA's New in version 2.08:**

  * SmartSniff now remembers the last file type you selected in 'Load Packets Data From File' option. 
  * Fixed the window title of 'Display Filter' option.
