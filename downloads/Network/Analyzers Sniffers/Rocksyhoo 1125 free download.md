**Publisher's Description**  
  

The best way to secure yourself against sniffing is to use encryption. While
this will not prevent a sniffer from functioning, it will ensure that what a
sniffer reads is pure junk (unreadable text).

Yahoo Messenger does not use encryption. As a result of that, Instant
Messaging conversations can be intercepted and logged. Rocksyhoo provides
encryption for Yahoo Messenger. Rocksyhoo will encrypt each message before it
is sent and will decrypt that message after it is received on the destination
computer. Both users must have installed Rocksyhoo and use the same password
established by agreement in private or by public key protocol.

This software is free to use for everyone, but we can build special
application for private use. We develop encryption application for security
and data protection.
