**Publisher's Description**  
  

SoftPerfect Network Protocol Analyzer is a free professional tool for
analyzing, debugging, maintaining and monitoring local networks and Internet
connections. It captures the data passing through your dial-up connection or
network Ethernet card, analyses this data and then represents it in an easily
readable form. SoftPerfect Network Protocol Analyzer is a useful tool for
network administrators, security specialists, network application developers
and anyone who needs a comprehensive picture of the traffic passing through
their network connection or segment of a local area network.

SoftPerfect Network Protocol Analyzer presents the results of its network
analysis in a convenient and easily understandable format. It also allows you
to defragment and reassemble network packets into streams. The program can
easily analyze network traffic based on a number of different Internet
protocols as listed below.

SoftPerfect Network Protocol Analyzer features full decoding of the following
low level protocols: AH, ARP, ESP, ICMP, ICMPv6, IGMP, IP, IPv6, IPX, LLC,
MSG, REVARP, RIP, SAP, SER, SNAP, SPX, TCP and UDP. It also performs full
reconstruction of top-level protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, FTP,
TELNET and others.

The flexible system of fully configurable filters can be used to discard all
network traffic except the specific traffic patterns you wish to analyze.
SoftPerfect Network Protocol Analyzer also features a packet builder. This
