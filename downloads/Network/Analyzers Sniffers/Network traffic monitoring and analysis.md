**Publisher's Description**  
  


NetSniffer is an interesting tool when setting up a home network, for instance to test if a certain PC really receives and transmits data. Additional, NetSniffer allows any user to inspect by himself, which data the attached PCs actually transmit. PCs, which send data over the LAN unwantedly, can so be easily retrieved. NetSniffer is able to intercept network packets already on the lowest level, the Ethernet layer. In addition to the packet data in clear text, the addresses of sender and recipient as well as the protocol type used in this packet are displayed among others.
