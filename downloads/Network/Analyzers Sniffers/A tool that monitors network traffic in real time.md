**Publisher's Description**  
  


MKN NetSniffer Console is a tool that monitors network traffic in real time. It monitors TCP, UDP, ICMP and other protocols. 

NetSniffer Console runs under Windows and does not require an installation. It does not interrupt network traffic sent by other applications. This makes it a powerful tool for analyzing network connection problems, data leaks, network protocols, and for debugging network applications. NetSniffer analyzes packets sent across a network connection. Information about packets can be printed to the screen or saved to a file for later analysis.
