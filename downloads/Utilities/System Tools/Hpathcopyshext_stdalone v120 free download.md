**Publisher's Description**  
  

This little shell extension adds a few enhancement to the current shell
context menu. Version postfixed with A'_StdAloneA' no requires runtime
libraries (RTL50.BPL and VCL50.BPL)  
In this version these are the newly added functions:  

  * Menu A'**Copy Path to Clipboard**A' with the following sub menu items 
    * A'**Copy Path as Long Name to Clipboard **A'  
Copies the selected fileA's full path to the clipboard in itA's long file name
format.

    * A'**Copy Path as Short Name to Clipboard **A'  
Copies the selected fileA's full path to the clipboard in itA's short file
name format.

    * A'**Only the File Name Part as Long Name**A'  
Copies the selected fileA's name to the clipboard without path in long file
name format. (Visible only if the selected shell item is a directory.)

    * A'**Only the File Name Part as Short Name**A'  
Copies the selected fileA's name to the clipboard without path in short file
name format. (Visible only if the selected shell item is a directory.)

    * A'**Only the Directoy Name Part as Long Name**A'  
Copies the selected fileA's directory path to the clipboard in itA's long file
name format.

Holding key Ctrl down while selecting any of the copy menu items adding
surrounding apostrophes to the path str copied to the clipboard.

menu items of HPathCopyShExt if you selected more than one file!)
