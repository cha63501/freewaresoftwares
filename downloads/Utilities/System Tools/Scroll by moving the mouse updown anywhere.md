**Publisher's Description**  
  


MouseImp is a handy tool that helps you to use your conventional mouse more efficiently. The AutoShrink feature increases your available workspace by removing toolbars from the screen so that only caption bars remain. The Direct Scroll feature makes it easier to scroll through windows. Instead of using a scroll bar, you can activate MouseImp and scroll by moving the mouse up or down anywhere in the window.
