**Publisher's Description**  
  

This application allows you to create an Ubuntu Live USB device from a Windows
PC. Now you donA't have to be using Ubuntu to make an Ubuntu Live USB.

In addition to being able to create an Ubuntu Live USB, the program can make
Live USBs for other Ubuntu variants. Creating Live USBs for Kubuntu and
Xubuntu has been tested successfully, and it is very likely that other
variants (Edubuntu, et al.) can be installed as a Live USB as well.

An Ubuntu Live USB device allows you to take the Ubuntu Linux operating system
with you anywhere! In addition, if you ever run into a problem where you
cannot boot Windows (and cannot access your files), you can use an Ubuntu Live
USB drive to boot your computer into a nice Linux GUI environment and recover
your files. An entire operating system in a thumb-drive. Pretty cool, huh?

The application is fairly simple. First, you select an ISO image or CD/DVD
source. Next, you choose the thumb-drive that you want to install the
ISO/CD/DVD image on. Finally, you can select the size of a persistence file
(this stores your documents and settings on the USB drive even after you have
shut-down the computer - highly recommended). There are various persistence
file sizes from 128MB to 4096MB so that you can maximize the use of your
thumb-drive capacity.
