**Publisher's Description**  
  

ZenKEY allows you to control almost all aspects of your computer via the
keyboard and mouse. Using keystrokes that work no matter what program you are
in, you can:

  * Launch a program or bring it back into focus 
  * Open a document, folder or Internet resource 
  * Perform an Internet search 
  * Minimize or maximize a window 
  * Resize, move or alter a window 
  * Issue a Media command, such as play, pause or volume up/down 
  * Start your screensaver or shutdown your computer 
  * Access hidden Windows utilities 
  * Control Winamp or compatible media players (we love QCD Player!) 
  * Simulate a series of keystrokes 
  * Instantly display any menu of programs or actions at the mouse pointer 
Using the ZenKEY configuration utility, you can add any program, add or alter
any menu, and assign any keystroke to perform any action.

A new A'Auto-window transparencyA' feature allows windows to be made
transparent as then gain or lose focus.
