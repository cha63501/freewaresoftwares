**Publisher's Description**  
  

This great little application allows you to automatically execute a script or
application each time a USB storage device is plugged into your PC. Different
scripts can be executed for different devices and itAs the volume label that
determines what action to perform.

Some examples (dependent on the scripts you write) are:

  * Copy new podcasts to your MP3 player.. see website for a full guide on how to do this! 
  * Copy other media from specific folders onto your USB memory stick 
  * Backup your USB memory stick automatically when itAs inserted 
  * Backup files from your PC onto a portable hard drive (perhaps firing up a copy of MicrosoftAs SyncToy) 
  * Anything else you can think of that you can write in a script!
