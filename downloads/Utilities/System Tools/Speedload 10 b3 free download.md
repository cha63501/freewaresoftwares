**Publisher's Description**  
  

SpeedLoad monitors a programA's activities and then optimizes the application
so it loads more quickly. If more install programs performed their job
properly SpeedLoad would have nothing to do, but most of them only do the bare
minimum that is required to get the program up and running and little else.

SpeedLoad has two primary functions. It ensures that all DLLA's the program
uses are in different and non-overlapping addresses and ensures that the EXE
is bound to the DLLA's it uses.
