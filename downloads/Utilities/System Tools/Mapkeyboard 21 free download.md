**Publisher's Description**  
  

MapKeyboard is a free program to remap your keyboard. Using MapKeyboard, you
can alter any key on your keyboard to function as a different one or
altogether disable it as well.

This is an essential tool for laptop users and other people with keyboards
whose keys differ from the standard 101 keyboard layout. The changes made are
universal across all applications & games and best of all, MapKeyboard does
not even need to be actively loaded in memory.

**Features:**

  * Officially supports Windows Vista 
  * Changes are made at a low level so that they take effect in all programs and 3D games 
  * This remapper does not need to be loaded in memory all the time 
  * Supports disabling of keys rather than remapping them 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
