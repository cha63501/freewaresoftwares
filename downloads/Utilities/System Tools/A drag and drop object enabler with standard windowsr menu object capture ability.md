Winabler is a drag-and-drop object enabler with standard WindowsA(r) menu object capture ability. 

Have you ever been evaluating software and discovered a feature you wanted to try was disabled or "grayed out"? Well, Winabler will usually enable the feature regardless of the softwareA's intentions. It particularly comes in handy when a program contains features that are crippled by disabling buttons, drop-down boxes or the like and you want to fully evaluate the "crippleware" prior to possibly purchasing it.

Winabler is Freeware. Keep it in your favorite toolbox for that time you really need it.
