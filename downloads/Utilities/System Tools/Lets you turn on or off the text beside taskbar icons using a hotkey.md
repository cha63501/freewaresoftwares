You may usually prefer the new Windows 7 style of the taskbar, featuring just the icons of all open applications, reserving space and supporting better focus. There are conditions under which you might prefer, at least for a while, to see the text beside taskbar icons. Taskbar Labels will let you turn on or off the text beside taskbar icons, using a toggle hotkey you can define at will. 

Taskbar Labels is a portable application: just unpack the contents of the zip file to a folder of your choice (the default is TaskbarLabels) and create a shortcut to the executable wherever you like A in your startup folder, if you want the program to run with Windows).

The default keyboard shortcut to hide or reveal taskbar icon labels is Ctrl+F11, but you can change it at will, by right clicking the icon of Taskbar Labels at the System Tray. First time it runs, Taskbar Labels will pop up a message; after its ini file (simple text file containing its configuration) is created, you wonAt see any other pop ups.

Taskbar Labels is small, handy, portable, and absolutely free from viruses, spyware, ads, etc.
