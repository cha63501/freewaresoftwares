**Publisher's Description**  
  


SplashKiller will help you hide those splash screens that appear when an application is loading. 

**Features:**

  * Find a A'no splash screenA' option (if one exists) in the application. 
  * Modify your registry to turn off a splash screen. 
  * Hack the application itself to remove the splash screen. 
There may be some splash screens that SplashKiller doesnA't hide, and there might possibly be some windows that arenA't splash screens that SplashKiller will hide by accident. 

But, at the moment, SplashKiller is hiding all the splash screens on the authors PC (which is the main reason it was written).
