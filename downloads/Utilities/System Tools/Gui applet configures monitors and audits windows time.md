**Publisher's Description**  
  


Domain Time II Windows Time Agent is a special Control Panel applet that allows you to easily configure the Microsoft Windows Time Service instead of using the w32tm command-line utility or manually changing registry settings. Windows Time Agent solves several of the major drawbacks of using Windows Time, such as determining how the service is actually configured, and whether or not it is really working. Windows Time Agent provides visual indicators of the clock status so you can tell at a glance whether the machine is is synchronized, what time sources are in use, and how accurate the clock is. The Windows Time Agent also shows clock drift data in scalable graphical displays so you can see how your clock is performing over time.
