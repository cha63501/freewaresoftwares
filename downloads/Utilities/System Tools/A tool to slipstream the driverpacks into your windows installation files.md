**Publisher's Description**  
  


The DriverPacks BASE is an easy to use tool to slipstream the DriverPacks (huge collections of drivers of a specific category of devices such as Graphics or Sound) into your Windows installation files. It can be used in more than 15 languages and allows you to easily choose the slipstream options, as well as the options for the DriverPacks Finisher. 

The DriverPacks Finisher will also be slipstreamed into your Windows installation files and will handle all exceptions (such as control panels for drivers) nicely. You can also choose to extend the default Windows driver library, so that you will never have to go and find drivers again.

This software is being recommended by many professional users and is being used at several universities and many pc shops.
