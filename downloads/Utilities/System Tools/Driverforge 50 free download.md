**Publisher's Description**  
  

DriverForge is a program that will automatically install all drivers from a
specified location. These drivers can be compressed or uncompressed.

You must put all compressed drivers at the root of ONE chosen folder (not in
any sub-folders of that folder), which will then be uncompressed to another
chosen location. Any uncompressed drivers can be in ONE folder but it is
recursive (drivers can be in sub folders as well). The program installs the
drivers from the uncompressed location.

**Features:**

  * Give a family member or friend a CD/DVD/USB stick with every driver they could ever need. Create an autorun.inf to automatically run and install all drivers from that removable drive on their computer. 
  * IT folks can use it post-imaging to install the rest of the drivers they didnA't want to install pre-imaging. Especially helpful to install drivers from a mapped location. 
  * Download the latest drivers from all the manufacturers for your machine. Point the program to install drivers from one location and hit Start!
