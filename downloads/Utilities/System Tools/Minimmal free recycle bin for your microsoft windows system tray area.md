**Publisher's Description**  
  


MicroBin is the most minimmal (10 KB) free recycle bin for your Microsoft Windows system tray area; the area next to the clock in the taskbar. MicroBin is a fork of MiniBin, but without all the extras. This means: no settings, no icon changing, no translationA nada. 

MicroBin offers only the pure and simple, initial idea MiniBin started out with. A double-click on the systray icon empties the recycle bin, while the menu offers options to empty but also open the recycle bin. MicroBin has only two icon states, just like the operating system it was built for. As said: no extras.
