**Publisher's Description**  
  

WhyReboot will try to help you determine if an installer has requested post-
reboot file replacement, or other pending operations that may require a
reboot.

WhyReboot is a small (~60KB) Windows application that displays a list of
pending file operations that will occur after rebooting your computer. It can
be helpful in determining whether a reboot is really necessary, or an
installer is just A'playing it safeA' in requiring a reboot.
