**Publisher's Description**  
  

Runs hidden in the background until it detects any kind of change in a
directory it has been told to monitor. When a change occurs (e.g. create,
delete, modify a file) it visually alerts the user. Can be used, for example,
to detect incoming information over a network or to detect tampering of files.
Uses very little memory and practically no CPU time.
