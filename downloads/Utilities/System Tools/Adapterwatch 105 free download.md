**Publisher's Description**  
  

AdapterWatch displays useful information about your network adapters: IP
addresses, Hardware address, WINS servers, DNS servers, MTU value, Number of
bytes received or sent, The current transfer speed, and more. In addition, it
displays general TCP/IP/UDP/ICMP statistics for your local computer.

**System Requirements:**  
This utility works perfectly on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003,
and Windows Vista. You can also use this utility on Windows 98/ME, but under
these operating systems, some of the adapter information may not be displayed
properly.

**What's New in version 1.05:**

  * Fixed bug: AdapterWatch displayed wrong MTU value returned by Windows API. Now the MTU value is loaded from the Registry. 
  * Added 'Copy Selected Cell' option.
