**Publisher's Description**  
  

LocalWeblog is a program that allows you to run your own private web based
notebook simply in one folder. It is not professional product, I made it for
my own needs, and placed it here just to share with people.

LocalWeblog lets you to save your notes, organize them by categories and
supports text-search among notes. Each note can contain picture, audio or
video information and LocalWebLog will play it (by means of embedded player).

LocalWebLog goes with a number of asp.net-Themes and can look differently, it
also has some funny scripts that you can run.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
