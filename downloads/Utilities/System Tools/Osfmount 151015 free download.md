**Publisher's Description**  
  

OSFMount allows you to mount local dd image files (bit-for-bit copies of a
disk partition) in Windows.

OSFMount supports RAM disks (basically a disk mounted into RAM) and also
supports mounting images of CDs. You can then analyze mounted disk images with
PassMark OSForensics by using the mounted volume drive letter.
