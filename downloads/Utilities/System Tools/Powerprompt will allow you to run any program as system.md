**Publisher's Description**  
  


PowerPrompt will start a new command console. This console is running with System privileges and any program launched from this prompt will inherit System credentials. This allows you access to all processes, including system processes, full access to the registry, Active Directory, and much more. Imagine running Task Manager, Services.msc, RegEdit, admgmt.msc, etc. with System credentials: In rare cases the power of PowerPrompt will solve problems that otherwise would require a system boot.
