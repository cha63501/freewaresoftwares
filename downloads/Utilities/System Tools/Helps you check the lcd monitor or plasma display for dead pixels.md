**Publisher's Description**  
  


Whenever you buy an LCD monitor or plasma display, the fear is always the same: What about dead pixels? 

Dead Pixel Locator is a powerful application that helps you check the LCD monitor or plasma display for dead pixels.

The application displays homogeneous colors on the monitor. Use the arrow keys to change the colors, and check every part of the screen very carefully for every color. If you find any pixels that have different colors than the background, first make sure that it is not the dust on the surface of the screen. :-) If you cannot wipe it off, that is a defective pixel.
