**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is mainly for installation on any USB drive but may also be run from the computer or even on a U3 device, via the Virtual CD. 

Intended for use by those frequenting public Internet shops (many of which are riddled with viruses), it has a number of useful features such as the ability to close the current browser should it become frozen (often access to Task Manager is forbidden) and will keep a permanent watch on USB drives for the arrival of the inevitable hidden viruses. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
