**Publisher's Description**  
  


Windows Enabler allows the user to enable disabled windows and controls such as buttons and tick boxes and choose menu options that would normally be disabled. This is obviously a very dangerous practice if used recklessly but having said that, youAd be surprised at how often it comes in handy. 

Windows Enabler has a very simple user interface; it appears as an icon in the system tray and can be turned on and off simply by clicking on it.
