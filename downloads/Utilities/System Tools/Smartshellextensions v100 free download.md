**Publisher's Description**  
  

SmartShellExtensions are extensions for the Windows 9x/ME/2K/NT shell.
SmartShellExtensions latch themselves into the context menu of Windows
Explorer and extends its abilities. It also inserts an icon in the system tray
which gives you access to your Desktop without having to minimize all open
windows. A real time-saver. (This version is in German.)
