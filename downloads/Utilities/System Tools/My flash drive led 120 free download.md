**Publisher's Description**  
  

My Flash Drive LED shows flash drive and card reader activity in real time in
the systray area.  
  
This is useful if your flash drive or card reader doesnA't have a led.  
  
The systray icon will blink every time a read/write operation is performed
(like a real hard drive led!).  
  
Read / write led color can be customized using the menu.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com

**WhatA's New in version 1.20:**

  * (fixed) auto updater does not works on Windows 7 64 bit when executed on Windows startup 
  * changed the software updater module (fixed a possible incompatibility with Norton Power Eraser which may report a false positive) 
  * when a new version is available, the list of latest changes is shown in the same window
