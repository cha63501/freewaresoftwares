**Publisher's Description**  
  


Faber Toys is a system utility, mainly developed for power users who want to know whatA's going on in their Personal Computer. It may also be used by programmers as a tool for tracking their application. 

The goal is to create an application running on most PC configurations, that use an FPL (Fast Property Load) technology to speed up the recovery of information on slow computers.

All information about the program is saved in a configuration file located in the installation directory; this means that no information is saved into the Registry (I don't like programs that fill the Registry with unnecessary data for the System). All information is saved in several subdirectories of installation dir, ready to be restored.
