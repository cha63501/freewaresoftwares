**Publisher's Description**  
  


IdleStart will either run a program or open a file in its default program after a certain length of system idle time that you decide. 

You can use this from the Windows Run dialog or use the parameters in a shortcut target. Do NOT just click & run like a normal program or it will do absolutely nothing but sit in the system tray and look stupid.

If you use a shortcut to start this, make sure you put the path to the folder your file or program is located in as the A'Start in:A' location. Not the path to the file, just the folder.

Right click the tray icon for 2 menu options: Exit and Disable/Enable. Hover over the icon to see path of file it is set to open.
