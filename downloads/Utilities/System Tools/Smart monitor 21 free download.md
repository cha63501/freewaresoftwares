**Publisher's Description**  
  

Hard disk drive manufacturers have adopted a standard called S.M.A.R.T. (Self-
Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) which reports many internal
drive performance attributes. This software monitors these attributes and
alerts user to falling values due to damage or wear and tear. By being alerted
to falling performance attributes, chance of data loss is minimized since
proper preventive action can be taken before disastrous drive failure occurs.
