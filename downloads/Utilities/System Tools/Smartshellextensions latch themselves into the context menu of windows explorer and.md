**Publisher's Description**  
  


SmartShellExtensions are extensions for the Windows 9x/ME/2K/NT shell. SmartShellExtensions latch themselves into the context menu of Windows Explorer and extends its abilities. It also inserts an icon in the system tray which gives you access to your Desktop without having to minimize all open windows. A real time-saver. (This version is in German.)
