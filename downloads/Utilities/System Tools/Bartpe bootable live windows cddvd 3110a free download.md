**Publisher's Description**  
  

BartA's PE Builder helps you build a "BartPE" (Bart Preinstalled Environment)
bootable Windows CD-Rom or DVD from the original Windows XP or Windows Server
2003 installation/setup CD, very suitable for PC maintenance tasks. Users can,
for instance, recover data from a failed operating system installation, or
reset a lost administrator password.

It will give you a complete Win32 environment with network support, and a
graphical user interface. Very handy for burn-in testing systems with no OS,
rescuing files to a network share, virus scan and so on. This will replace any
Dos bootdisk in no time!
