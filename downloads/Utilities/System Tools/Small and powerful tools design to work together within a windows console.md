**Publisher's Description**  
  


WinGuruXP Console is a set of small and powerful tools design to work together within a Windows Console (SWVE. Single Window Virtual Environment). It was designed and built to take full advantage of the Windows XP Operating System while providing an open platform to continue adding more tools, internal/external plug-ins and functionality in future releases. 

WinGuru XP Console is a compact, single binary file application less than 2MB in size. It doesnAt require installation/de-installation scripts or registry entries, making it a truly non-intrusive application, simply unzip it and use it. The Console or Main SWVE Window works as a ASingle Pane of GlassA launching and managing all the built-in applications, and controlling how they interact with each other and the Operating System. 

Once the Console is started all the SWVE applications become available and functional while the Console is running. Each SWVE application can be individually started and terminated without effecting the remaining running applications or the Operating System. When the Console is terminated all the SWVE applications will be shut-down.
