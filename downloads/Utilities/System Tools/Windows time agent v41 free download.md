**Publisher's Description**  
  

Domain Time II Windows Time Agent is a special Control Panel applet that
allows you to easily configure the Microsoft Windows Time Service instead of
using the w32tm command-line utility or manually changing registry settings.
Windows Time Agent solves several of the major drawbacks of using Windows
Time, such as determining how the service is actually configured, and whether
or not it is really working. Windows Time Agent provides visual indicators of
the clock status so you can tell at a glance whether the machine is is
synchronized, what time sources are in use, and how accurate the clock is. The
Windows Time Agent also shows clock drift data in scalable graphical displays
so you can see how your clock is performing over time.
