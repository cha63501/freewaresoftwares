**Publisher's Description**  
  

MiniBin is a free recycle bin for your Microsoft Windows system tray area; the
area next to the clock in your taskbar.

Minibin may come handy when youA're hiding the recycle bin from your desktop
or if youA're using a replacement shell that provides a system tray but no
useable recycle bin (like litestep or emerge desktop). But you also might be
just like me... wanting to be able to empty the recycle bin without the need
to minimize any windows.

Whatever reason you have to use Minibin, it will sure spare you the additional
clicks you are used to, while providing everything you need in a place where
you have easy access to it, while enabling you to modify and tweak the visual
parts to your personal preference.

To keep it short: MiniBin supports modifications like using your own icons,
your own language and some recycle-bin related settings.
