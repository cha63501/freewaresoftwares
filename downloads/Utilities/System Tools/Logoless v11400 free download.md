**Publisher's Description**  
  

LogoLess is a tiny tray-based program to filter out out that annoying popup
Start-Menu when you hit the Windows Logo-Key by accident. The developers goals
are to keep it small (with very little demand for system resources), easy to
install and configure, and the ability to filter full screen or window
(MAME32) based apps/games.
