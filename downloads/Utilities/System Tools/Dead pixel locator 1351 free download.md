**Publisher's Description**  
  

Whenever you buy an LCD monitor or plasma display, the fear is always the
same: What about dead pixels?

Dead Pixel Locator is a powerful application that helps you check the LCD
monitor or plasma display for dead pixels.

The application displays homogeneous colors on the monitor. Use the arrow keys
to change the colors, and check every part of the screen very carefully for
every color. If you find any pixels that have different colors than the
background, first make sure that it is not the dust on the surface of the
screen. :-) If you cannot wipe it off, that is a defective pixel.
