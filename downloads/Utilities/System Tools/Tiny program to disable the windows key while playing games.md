**Publisher's Description**  
  


LogoLess is a tiny tray-based program to filter out out that annoying popup Start-Menu when you hit the Windows Logo-Key by accident. The developers goals are to keep it small (with very little demand for system resources), easy to install and configure, and the ability to filter full screen or window (MAME32) based apps/games.
