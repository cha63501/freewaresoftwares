WinApp_Manager is like the Linux package manager, but for Windows. It can
update programs you already have installed and it's also possible to install
other free programs.

**Features:**

  * Notify you of new program- and driver updates, download them if you want it and then install them in silent mode (if possible) 
  * The Software-Setups you downloaded will be replaced when you download a newer version of it 
  * The program can also use already existing setups when you choose to install something: good when you have to reinstall the system( so it would be better NOT to install this program on the system partition 
  * Also with the driver installation this will be possible after a system reinstall 
  * It is also possible to install other programs you don't have but they will be only open source or/and totally free without registration or whatsoever
