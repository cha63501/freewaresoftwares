**Publisher's Description**  
  

DDMM is a program made for people who use 2 or more display display monitors.

It prevents the mouse from crossing from one screen to another too easily, and
allows teleporting the mouse pointer from one screen to another with a
keyboard shortcut.

This is a standalone .exe that does not require installation.

**Features:**

  * Automatically adjusts to any display configuration changes 
  * Hotkey to enable/disable 
  * Hotkey to teleport mouse pointer between displays 
  * Supports up to 3 displays 
  * Tray icon reports the current monitor and status 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).

**WhatA's New in version 1.1:**

  * Preview rectangles were set as option, allowing to enable / disable them, with default disabled. 
  * Fully automatic mode was added and set as default: 
    * The program reacts automatically to any display configuration/resolution changes. 
    * Preview rectangles are updated accordingly, if preview enabled and program not minimized. 
    * Coordinates are automatically recalculated for any change and canA't be entered manually in automatic mode. 
  * "Mouse teleport" mechanism was added to teleport mouse between displays with a keyboard shortcut. 
  * Some optimizations were made in the code to reduce CPU load on mouse movement. 
  * Since the program has no taskbar icon, it can be "lost" when the focus is lost, so the window was made topmost when open, and its design was changed a bit to incorporate new options. 
  * Changed the tray icon menu to include "restore" option. 
  * Changed the tray icon left click behavior to restore on single click. 
  * Added exit hook, removing the global hooks and restoring control on forced exit
