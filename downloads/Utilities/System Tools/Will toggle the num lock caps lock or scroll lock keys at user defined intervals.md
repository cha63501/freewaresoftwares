**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program will toggle the Num Lock, Caps Lock, or Scroll Lock keys at user defined intervals. It is possible to setup which keys to toggle and how often to toggle each key. This program also has command line support, so you can setup a shortcut to toggle each key. It can also be added to the Windows startup, where it would automatically begin toggling the keys. The best part about this program is that it is totally hidden to the user, and they will be unable to determine the source of the toggle.
