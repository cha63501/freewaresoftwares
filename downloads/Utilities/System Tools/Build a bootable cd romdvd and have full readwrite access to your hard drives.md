**Publisher's Description**  
  


BartA's PE Builder helps you build a "BartPE" (Bart Preinstalled Environment) bootable Windows CD-Rom or DVD from the original Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 installation/setup CD, very suitable for PC maintenance tasks. Users can, for instance, recover data from a failed operating system installation, or reset a lost administrator password. 

It will give you a complete Win32 environment with network support, and a graphical user interface. Very handy for burn-in testing systems with no OS, rescuing files to a network share, virus scan and so on. This will replace any Dos bootdisk in no time!
