**Publisher's Description**  
  

CD-DVD Icon Repair is a small utility that will repair Windows if your CD or
DVD drive is missing or not recognized by Windows or other programs.

CD-DVD Icon Repair can also repair (reset) your Autoplay or Autorun settings
and protect your computer against Autorun parasites (virus) by disabling the
Autorun feature for removable drives.

In Windows 7 it will disable autorun for non-Volume devices to protect against
viruses, since Microsoft have permanently disabled autorun.inf for removable
drives.
