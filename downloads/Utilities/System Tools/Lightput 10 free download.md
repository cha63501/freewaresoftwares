**Publisher's Description**  
  

Lightput is a freeware program that can control the amazing lighting
technology available today. LightputA's goal is to make high-end LED lighting
more accessible to homes, small businesses, and creative projects working on a
budget that wish to have high quality, customizable lighting. Lightput is a
simple to use freeware solution for controlling lights through DMX
communications, which is a widely used, time-tested system for controlling
lighting.

Lightput is designed to control lighting as soon as it runs in a very simple
and easy to use way. Unlike most DMX software, Lightput does not attempt to
profile different lights on the market or specifically support effects like
panning, etc. Although you could control these effects with Lightput, Lightput
is all about controlling the output levels of lighting, specifically designed
to control new dimmable LED drivers.
