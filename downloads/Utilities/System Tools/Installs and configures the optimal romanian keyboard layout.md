**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ergo Romanian is a small software application that installs and configures the optimal keyboard layout for the Romanian language. 

After installation, this layout is readily available from the taskbarA's language indicator. Works with any standard QWERTY keyboard. The resulting layout provides fluent typing and requires virtually no training, as well as virtually no keyboard labeling. 

Non-Romanian letters like Q, W, Y, K, X are moved to the AltGr shift state to make space for the Romanian diacritic letters, taking advantage of the fact that each non-Romanian letter is positioned in the immediate proximity of a base letter of diacritic letters.
