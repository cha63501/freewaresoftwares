**Publisher's Description**  
  

AD Inspector is a simple Explorer-style interface for Active Directory account
management and reporting. It significantly reduces the administrative burden
of identifying and remediating Active Directory security pain points. Simply
enter the search criteria (creation dates, last logon, and password expiration
flags) and immediately identify any objects within Active Directory that match
it.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
