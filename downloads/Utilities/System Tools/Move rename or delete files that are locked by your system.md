**Publisher's Description**  
  


A free tool for handling files and folders, locked by Windows, system services or other applications. Using it, you can rename, move or delete any locked file or folder at the next system restart. 

EMCO MoveOnBoot integrates with standard Windows mechanism for locked resources management, so using very simple visual interface you can select locked resources and define operations that should be performed with them by Windows kernel at the next PC restart. 

If you ever faced with situation when you get an error message from Windows while trying to move, rename or delete locked folders or files, you know that it's very annoying and confusing. Windows doesn't provide any details in this case, so you have no idea what application holds the lock and how to proceed.

With EMCO MoveOnBoot you can resolve any problems with locked files and folders with no headache or difficulties. Every time, when you get error message when, for example, you try to delete locked file or folder, you can launch EMCO MoveOnBoot and drag locked resource to it or, alternatively, choose locked file or folder using file system picker. Then you only need to select move, rename or delete operation to be executed with resource at the next system restart. 

When operations with locked files or folders are defined, you can continue your work and exit from EMCO MoveOnBoot or launch computer reboot immediately. Anyway, after a system restart you will find that all operations with locked resources are completed successfully.
