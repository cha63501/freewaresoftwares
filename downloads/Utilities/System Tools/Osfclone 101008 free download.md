**Publisher's Description**  
  

OSFClone is a free, self-booting solution which enables you to create or clone
exact raw disk images quickly and independent of the installed operating
system.

After creating or cloning a disk image, you can mount the image with [PassMark
OSFMount](http://osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html) before
conducting analysis with PassMark OSForensics.

OSFClone creates a forensic image of a disk, preserving any unused sectors,
slack space, file fragmentation and undeleted file records from the original
hard disk. Boot into OSFClone and create disk clones of FAT, NTFS and USB-
connected drives! OSFClone can be booted from CD/DVD drives, or from USB flash
drives.

Verify that a disk clone is identical to the source drive, by using OSFClone
to compare the MD5 or SHA1 hash between the clone and the source drive. After
image creation, you can choose to compress the newly created image, saving
disk space.

**WhatA's New in version 1.0.1008:**

  * Allow specifying block size for dd 
  * Allow specifying number of sectors to read at once for AFF 
  * Added 'noutc' bootcode, which should prevent clock adjustment by linux kernal.
