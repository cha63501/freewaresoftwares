Many people do not know how to manually get all important details about their
computers. Fortunately, PCFerret makes it easy for anyone with basic computer
skills to get a summary of a computer, including all connected pieces of
hardware. The system information viewer does more than provide a comprehensive
system summary. You can also use it to perform various functions, such as
scheduling tasks and analyzing files.

**Features at a Glance**

  * Provides comprehensive system report 
  * Generates complex passwords 
  * Detects Alternate Data Streams 
  * Analyzes files 
  * Provides fast file search 
  * Provides report about reboot operations 

**Using PCFerret**

The software is especially designed with new users in mind, but it includes
powerful features that advanced users will appreciate. Its tabbed graphic
interface is so user-friendly and intuitive that novices wonAt need to worry
about digging deep into the program to access required features.

In addition to the conventional File Menu, the program features a toolbar on
the top part of its window, which has three buttons for analyzing files,
generating passwords and closing the program. Below these are four tabs for
welcome, system details, reboot operations and Alternate Data Streams.

It extracted and displayed detailed information about our computer, which
could become especially handy for troubleshooting purposes. We got details
about the operating system, installed .NET versions, monitors, computer,
motherboard, BIOS, CPU, RAM, USB controllers, printers, sound devices, video
adapters, network adapters and antivirus.

It is becoming increasingly important to have strong passwords that hackers
cannot guess, but creating them can be challenging. Thanks to the Password
Generator, we easily produced complex passwords that we customized to suit our
preferences. If you do not want to bother with many options, you can simply
select AMake all characters uniqueA and then click the AGenerate New PasswordA
button to come up with the strongest password.

Microsoft added Alternate Data Streams to the NTFS file system to make it more
compatible with the Macintosh File System. They are mostly used as metadata of
the main file. However, ADS may contain executable programs that can affect
computers. Thankfully, PCFerret allowed us to view their content. Even if you
cannot differentiate the things listed, the program detects and provides
information about anything odd with the ADS. It marks executable ADS in red.

Besides the ADS, PCFerret let us analyze other files that we wanted to get
more information about. In addition, this is an ideal program if you want to
search for files based on their contents. This can be useful in different
situations. For example, someone may deliberately change the suffix of a file
to hide its content or inadvertently specify a wrong suffix. While performing
a file search based on the suffix will mislead the searcher, PCFerret makes it
possible to find the right file irrespective of its suffix.

**Conclusion**

PCFerret is a powerful system information viewer that allows you to get
details about hidden data in addition to performing other tasks.
