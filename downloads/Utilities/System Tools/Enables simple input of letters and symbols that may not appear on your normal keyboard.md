**Publisher's Description**  
  


Type any accented characters for French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Scandinavian languages. Also other special characters - this small Windows software tool enables simple input of letters and symbols that may not appear on your normal keyboard. 

It has always been part of Plant Base, but is now also available as a separate stand-alone freeware utility. This software input panel can be used with almost any application, such as e-mail software, word processing, spreadsheets and so on.

Using the mouse, each letter will be typed directly into the selected application, at the current cursor position. The character is also copied to the Clipboard. In some situations, typing directly into another program is not allowed but the character can still be inserted by simply using Paste.

All the characters are from the ANSI Latin-1 character set, suitable for use with Western European and US fonts. Extended Unicode characters for other regions are not provided by this version, but might be in a future development.
