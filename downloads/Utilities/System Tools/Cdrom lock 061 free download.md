**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you ever pushed at your Notebook the button at your CD/DVD drive by
accident? This small programme blocks the eject button at almost every CD/DVD
drive and gives the user the power of controlling the CD/DVD drive by a small
icon at the windows system tray. This is a useful tool for all users working
with their Notebook, but is maybe also of interest for desktop users...
