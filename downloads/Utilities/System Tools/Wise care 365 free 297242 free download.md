There are many PC cleaner utilities that you can use to optimize computer
systems but they do not all have the same results. One of the best choices is
Wise Care 365, which is an all-in-one utility that cleans both registry and
hard disk in general. It includes a number of features that ensure your
computer runs at its optimum level.

**Main Features:**

  * Detects deeply hidden invalid registry problems that other cleaners miss 
  * Fast scanning speed 
  * Easy to use 
  * The developers provide professional technical support 

**Using Wise Care 265**

The PC cleaner installed fast and smoothly, and we could access it quickly via
the desktop shortcut it created during installation. The software has several
utilities:

  * PC Checkup: Scans useless files 
  * System Cleaner: Scans the registry 
  * System Tuneup: Shows items that can be optimized to optimize computer 
  * Privacy Protector: Checks for privacy risks (this utility requires registration) 
  * Wise Utilities: Provides links to utilities used to perform such functions as uninstalling programs, hiding folders, recovering deleted data, quick searching of local files, improving game performance, optimizing memory and shutting down computer automatically. 
We first ran the PC Checkup utility that scanned for useless files and grouped
them into several categories, including:

  * Junk files created by Windows and applications 
  * Invalid shortcuts 
  * Thumbnail cache 
  * Memory dump files 
  * Error report files 
  * Downloaded files created by windows 
  * System log files 

It displayed the number of items detected, problematic ones and those
requiring manual fixing. We were pleased that the application asked whether we
wanted to back up our system when we clicked the Fix Now button for the first
time.

When we restarted our system, Wise Care 365 showed us the time our computer
took to boot up in seconds and gave us the option to speed it up. Clicking the
Speedup button opened startup applications and services. It displayed the ones
that were turned on and their respective boot times.

The program also showed us the number of system and third-party services, and
pointing at each service displayed what it did and the effect of disabling it.
It showed the services that must not be disabled for proper performance.

You can use the software to defragment both the registry and disk and even
back up your system. It also provides a number of configuration options that
you can use to customize how it operates, including scheduling of cleaning
times. You can also choose a different theme to change the appearance of your
program.

Every PC can benefit from cleaning because even new ones come with some
useless stuff. Wise Care 365 is an ideal PC cleaner because it is both
powerful and easy to use. Although you can use the software free of charge,
you must upgrade to benefit from all its features.
