**Publisher's Description**  
  


A component manager/system explorer utility for Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP, TopToBottomNT is like "Task Manager on steroids." TopToBottomNT displays a summary list of processes, i.e., the "top" of a system, or drivers, the "bottom". 

Additional summary displays are modules that have been loaded by the currently active processes and registered ActiveX components. Each of these summary displays are sortable by name with additional criteria depending on display type, e.g., processes by creation time or drivers by driver base.

Detailed information on each type in the format of a tabsheet window is available by selecting and double-clicking an item. Again, the display will vary depending upon the item type.
