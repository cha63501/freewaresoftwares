**Publisher's Description**  
  

LockCD program disables CD/DVD-ROMA's eject button. It runs in the system tray
and identifies itself by a red icon, which drops a menu on the right mouse
click or shows Main UI on the left click. LockCD can also be accessed from the
Explorer Context Menu by right-clicking on the CD-ROM icon.

This application was written after giving up on finding a properly functioning
software that would lock CD-ROMA's eject button on my Lenovo T520 laptop,
which i hit quite frequently. The main problem with the software available on
the internet is that it doesnA't retain the lock state after
Sleep/Hibernation/Resume.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
