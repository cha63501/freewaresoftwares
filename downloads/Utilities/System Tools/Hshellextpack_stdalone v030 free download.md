**Publisher's Description**  
  

This little shell extension adds a few enhancement to the current shell
context menu. Version postfixed with A'_StdAloneA' no requires runtime
libraries (RTL50.BPL and VCL50.BPL)  
In this version these are the newly added functions.

  * Menu A'**Launch Safer...**A'  
This function was inspired by the tool [DropMyRights](http://msdn.microsoft.co
m/security/securecode/columns/default.aspx?10=pull=/library/en-
us/dncode/html/secure11152004.asp) by Michael Howard. If you are using windows
as Administrator (not recomendded) then you can launching programs or itA's
associated handler via HShellExtPack in a lower privileged context. (this way
e.g. your browser and mailer would have less chance to run unwanted content of
mails or web pages)  
The following sub menu items added.

    * A'**Normal**A'  
Means run the application as a normal user.

    * A'**Constrained**A'  
Means run the application as a constrained user.

    * A'**Untrusted**A'  
Means run the application as an untrusted user. Chances are, this will cause
some applications to fail.

You can find a detailed description of the different run levels [here](http://
msdn.microsoft.com/security/securecode/columns/default.aspx?10=pull=/library
/en-us/dncode/html/secure11152004.asp).

  * Menu A'**Launch At Priority...**A'  
You can launch a program or itA's associated handler at a desired start
priority level. (Currently only extensions in PATHEXT environment variable can
be started at a higher priority level, but no limitation on starting at a
lower priority level.)

Currently only single file selection works. (The context menu will NOT contain
menu items of HShellExtPack if you selected more than one file!)  

  * v 0.1.0 
First release

  * v 0.1.1 
\- Bug corrected, QueryContextMenu now filtering out more events that should
not be handled by a user shell extension.  
\- Lunch -> Changed Launch :(((

  * v 0.2.0 
\- Unicode support added  
\- handled extension types added/corrected  
\- lnk extension handling corrected  
\- directoy background handling added  
\- drive handling added  
\- launching directory handler failed, because of a bug in filename parsing

  * v 0.2.1 
\- launching directory handler might have failed, because of PathIsDirectory
does not handle quoted file path names

  * v 0.3.0 
\- added launcher.exe instead of calling cmd for starting not A'runableA'
files (files that extension not in PATHEXT environment variable)  
\- there is no limitation on starting a file at a given priority level  
\- enchanced error reporting in case of file starting error  
\- program stays more responsive while launching (e.g a long lasting DDE start
could lock the program for which the context menu shown, thankA's for Valery
Pryamikov for pointing out that using MsgWaitForMultipleObjects is much more
effective)  
\- used BCB5 for building  
\- install.bat corrected
