**Publisher's Description**  
  

There are times when you just want to listen to some music on your
notebook/laptop and want the display (LCD) of your notebook to remain off
while the lid is still open. While there are a small amount of notebook
manufacturerAs who provide this simple option of turning off the notebookAs
LCD when not in use, many do not. I own a HP DV2799 Special Edition notebook,
while itA's a great notebook in almost every way, it still lacks a basic
button to switch off the display (LCD) whenever I want to. This is the case
not only for this notebook, but also many new and expensive notebooks.

This led to me developing my very own small application which turns off my
notebook LCD just with one click. I wrote this application in C# using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. Its basically a simple console based application
that makes use of a dll(User32.dll) file from Windows using
System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace and then calls the required function.

I am sharing this small and useful application with all of you as a freeware
license. You are free to distribute and use this application. I have tested
this application on Windows Vista only. Please let us know if it works on
earlier versions of Windows.

OS Compatibility: Windows XP, Windows Vista.
