This is the ultimate replacement for the DOS dir command. ItA's small and efficient. You can see two columns of the directory listing and scroll up and down. Pressing return will result in an action depending on the file type: Directories are opened, Zip files are extracted and so on. All unknown files will be loaded in the DOS-Editor. You can change between 25 and 50 rows (yes, in the text-mode) copy and delete multiple files and sort by name, size, extension or date without using command line options.
