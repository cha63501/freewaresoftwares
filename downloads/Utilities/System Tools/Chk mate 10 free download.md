**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you ever lost important files after Scandisk or Chkdsk A'repairedA' the
file system? Did Scandisk or Chkdsk convert your files to Filexxxx.chk files?
Did you ever wonder if there was something useful in those filexxxx.chk files?
CHK-Mate will examine the contents of the CHK files and determine if the
contents are known file types, such as MS-Word files or GIF files. When
contents are recognized (for example, as a Word document), the CHK files are
copied to a new file with the correct file extension (Filexxxx.CHK to
Filexxxx.DOC). The new file extension allows you to easily open the file using
the associated program. If the contents of a CHK file cannot be linked to a
known file type, you have the option to extract all the readable text from the
CHK file. Use this option to recover information from a CHK file that is
perhaps not intact enough to be recovered completely as a known file type.

Note: Password for Setup program: CM-SUL-130103-CMRZ.
