**Publisher's Description**  
  

Displaying directory reports has never been so flexible. Report packs allow
you to view your report in any specified view. Integrate it within SmartDL or
run it on its own. Run reports to discover your environment prior to a
migration, or use the reports to audit your existing implementation.

Requires Windows 2000 service pack 1 or higher / Windows XP
