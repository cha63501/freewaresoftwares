**Publisher's Description**  
  

StrokesPlus is essentially a StrokeIt alternative, but with much more
flexibility. It allows you to assign actions based on mouse gestures to
automate or simplify many common tasks.

ItA's very lightweight, only using 250-400k of memory while running in the
background. StrokesPlus utilizes Lua scripting for the actions giving you a
great deal of power and flexibility.

**WhatA's new in version 2.8.2.0:**

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Changed the middle/X1/X2 mouse click scripts' logic to fire on mouse UP instead of mouse down, since that's generally when things do something in windows 
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Aforementioned function names changed from A'downA' to A'upA', for example sp_middle_mouse_down is now sp_middle_mouse_up 
  * Added similar code and options for firing on left and right mouse button up events 
  * Note that for all of these mouse click events, they will NOT fire on mouse up of the stroke button; sp_right_mouse_up will not be called if the right mouse button is your stroke button 
  * Also note that mouse click event scripts will not fire if the stroke button is currently being held down and S+ is either in an action or actively capturing the mouse (e.g. while drawing) 
  * Added acSetNumber and acGetNumber; the only purpose for this action pair is for communicating between Lua states 
  * Fixed bug where a few code blocks were waiting if either Lua state was executing, instead of only waiting when both Lua states were in use
