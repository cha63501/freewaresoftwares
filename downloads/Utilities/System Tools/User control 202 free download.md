**Publisher's Description**  
  

When you add an account for certain users with Windows XP / Vista, their user
names will appear on the Welcome Screen.

Sometimes a user needs to be added to the machine, because he / she needs
access (via the network) to resources on the machine, but he / she will not be
physically logging in on the computer.

This application enables you to remove their name from the Welcome Screen,
while still maintaining the user account.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
