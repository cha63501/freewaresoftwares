**Publisher's Description**  
  


When you add an account for certain users with Windows XP / Vista, their user names will appear on the Welcome Screen. 

Sometimes a user needs to be added to the machine, because he / she needs access (via the network) to resources on the machine, but he / she will not be physically logging in on the computer. 

This application enables you to remove their name from the Welcome Screen, while still maintaining the user account.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
