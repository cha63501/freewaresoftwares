**Publisher's Description**  
  

Volumouse provides you a quick and easy way to control the sound volume on
your system - simply by rolling the wheel of your wheel mouse.

It allows you to define a set of rules for determining when the wheel will be
used for changing the sound volume. For example: You can configure Volumouse
to use your mouse wheel for volume control when the Alt key is hold down, when
the left mouse button is down, when the mouse cursor is over the taskbar, and
so on...

When the conditions that you define are not satisfied, your mouse wheel will
be used for the regular scrolling tasks, exactly as before.
