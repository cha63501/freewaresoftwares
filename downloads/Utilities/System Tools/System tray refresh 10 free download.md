**Publisher's Description**  
  

System Tray Refresh does exactly what it says - refreshing the system tray
area (user notification area, or status area) removing "hanging", "orphaned"
or "dead" icons that were not removed on exit or crash of some programs. This
situation has been known for a long time as some kind of a system bug where
even the latest versions of Windows do not correct this issue automatically,
causing unnecessary and non-functional system tray clutter.

This small and formless applet can be run either directly or in a batch file
as well as by a scheduler or an event handler as needed. It runs silently and
exits automatically in a flash of a second. When this program is run - if
there are no dead icons in the system tray, you will not notice anything; if
there are some, they will be immediately cleared and disappear. Delivered as a
single EXE without installer, making it a truly portable application. DoesnA't
save anything on the PC.
