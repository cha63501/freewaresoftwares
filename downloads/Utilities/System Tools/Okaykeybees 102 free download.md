**Publisher's Description**  
  

OkayKeybees is a freeware keyboard remapper with a twist. You define what keys
are always replaced or what keys are replaced only when a user defined
modifier key is held. You can effectively "move" keys to either side of the
keyboard or even effective disable keys (like the Windows key).

No installation program is needed.
