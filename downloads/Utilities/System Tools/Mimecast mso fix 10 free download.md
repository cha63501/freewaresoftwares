**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you are a Mimecast user and are also using Windows 8.1, you may find that
when you have installed the Mimecast client for Outlook (MSO) and try to enter
your domain or cloud credentials, the username has SMTP set and cannot be
changed and the password part is greyed out.

We have created this MSI fix that will solve this issue for you and you can
then use this MSI on a large scale basis to push out using Group Policy,
Configuration Manager or WDS.

Please see our website for full instructions about using this program.
