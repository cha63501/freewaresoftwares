**Publisher's Description**  
  


Have you ever lost important files after Scandisk or Chkdsk A'repairedA' the file system? Did Scandisk or Chkdsk convert your files to Filexxxx.chk files? Did you ever wonder if there was something useful in those filexxxx.chk files? CHK-Mate will examine the contents of the CHK files and determine if the contents are known file types, such as MS-Word files or GIF files. When contents are recognized (for example, as a Word document), the CHK files are copied to a new file with the correct file extension (Filexxxx.CHK to Filexxxx.DOC). The new file extension allows you to easily open the file using the associated program. If the contents of a CHK file cannot be linked to a known file type, you have the option to extract all the readable text from the CHK file. Use this option to recover information from a CHK file that is perhaps not intact enough to be recovered completely as a known file type. 

Note: Password for Setup program: CM-SUL-130103-CMRZ.
