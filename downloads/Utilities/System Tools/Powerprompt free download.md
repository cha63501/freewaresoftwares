**Publisher's Description**  
  

PowerPrompt will start a new command console. This console is running with
System privileges and any program launched from this prompt will inherit
System credentials. This allows you access to all processes, including system
processes, full access to the registry, Active Directory, and much more.
Imagine running Task Manager, Services.msc, RegEdit, admgmt.msc, etc. with
System credentials: In rare cases the power of PowerPrompt will solve problems
that otherwise would require a system boot.
