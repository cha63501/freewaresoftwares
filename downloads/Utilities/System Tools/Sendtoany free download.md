SendToAny extends the Windows Explorer A'Send ToA' context menu with all known
links. This is accomplished by synchronizing the Send To Menu with the Start
Menu, Desktop and Quick Launch Menu.

  * SendToAny allows any file (including files with no filename extension and files with a reserved extension) to be sent to any application, regardless of file-type association, or a applicationsA' registration status.
  * SendToAny resolves all types of links, including Microsoft Installer (MS Office, Adobe Acrobat, etc etc), which are normally invisible to the Send To menu.
  * Stand-alone executable (includes self-referencing link creation/deletion code).
