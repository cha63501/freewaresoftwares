**Publisher's Description**  
  

WinGuruXP Console is a set of small and powerful tools design to work together
within a Windows Console (SWVE. Single Window Virtual Environment). It was
designed and built to take full advantage of the Windows XP Operating System
while providing an open platform to continue adding more tools,
internal/external plug-ins and functionality in future releases.

WinGuru XP Console is a compact, single binary file application less than 2MB
in size. It doesnAt require installation/de-installation scripts or registry
entries, making it a truly non-intrusive application, simply unzip it and use
it. The Console or Main SWVE Window works as a ASingle Pane of GlassA
launching and managing all the built-in applications, and controlling how they
interact with each other and the Operating System.

Once the Console is started all the SWVE applications become available and
functional while the Console is running. Each SWVE application can be
individually started and terminated without effecting the remaining running
applications or the Operating System. When the Console is terminated all the
SWVE applications will be shut-down.
