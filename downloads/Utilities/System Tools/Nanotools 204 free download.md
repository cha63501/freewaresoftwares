**Publisher's Description**  
  

NanoTools allows you to add useful new entries to your context menu (right-
click menu), for example:

  * Run applications with additional parameters/command-line arguments 
  * Swap contents of two selected files 
  * Move all files out of a folder and delete the folder (dissolve the folder) 
  * and many more... 

All features are designed to work optimally with the "User Account Control"
feature of Windows Vista and Windows 7. Additionally NanoTools enables you to
open any file-type as an Administrator, not just executable files

TimeShifter, a component of NanoTools, can simulate a fake date for other
applications. This is done by changing the system date when the application
starts. Depending on your settings, the correct date will be restored after a
few seconds or when the application exits. You can also freeze the system
clock while the application is running.

These settings can be packaged into separate shortcuts, so that you can launch
an application with a fake date via a simple double-click.

PowerCode, a component of NanoTools, can encrypt text with one of the
following algorithms:

  * Compact (Output has the same length as the input, contains special characters) 
  * Readable (Output has twice the length of the input, contains only lower-case letters, optimal for transfer via paper) 
  * Vernam (XOR-encryption, in combination with a sufficiently long password unbreakable encryption) 
  * Morse-Code (convert text to classic Morse-Code and back)
