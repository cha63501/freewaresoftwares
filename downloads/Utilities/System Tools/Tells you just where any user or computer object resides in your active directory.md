**Publisher's Description**  
  


When Microsoft wrote their Users and Computers snap-in for managing Active Directory they didnA't include a tool for locating an object in the Directory. For a small directory, objects may be easy to locate, but when you get into thousands of objects it all can be a bit harder to manage. Sure you can search for an item and then move it to a new location. However, what if you just want to know where something is at? Sorry, youA're out of luck. ThatA's where AD Locator comes in, it will tell you just where any User or Computer object resides in your Active Directory. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
