**Publisher's Description**  
  

Point-N-Click is a FREE on-screen virtual mouse designed for anyone with a
disability that prevents them from clicking a physical computer mouse. As long
as they can move a mouse, trackball or other pointing device, they can send
mouse clicks to virtually any application.

It was designed as a companion product to Lake SoftwareAs Click-N-Type but
also runs stand-alone. It uses AutoMouse, a feature similar to AutoClick for
those who find clicking the mouse button difficult or impossible.

Point-N-Click was designed with ease of use foremost in mind and it is FREE.
No charge and no strings attached. The combination of Point-N-Click and a
virtual keyboard will give the user complete freedom to use a computer. The
user will even be able to play many games.

The main window is icon based and does not require reading skills or language
translation. Even a young child can use it.

Version 2.1 includes additional functionality, a user configurable form, and
audio and visual feedback. A Break Timer has been added for users with
Repetitive Stress Injuries and to allow Point-N-Click to work with full screen
programs, Remote AutoMouse areas have been added. These are target areas the
user can create on the desktop that will work even when covered by other
programs. The Remote AuotoMouse areas are fully user configurable in size and
position and have optional audio and visible feedback.

Point-N-Click is a 32 bit WindowsA(r) application and as such runs on the
following operating systems: WindowsA(r) 95/98/NT4.x/Me/2000 or later.
