While you can use Control Panel to change settings which control nearly everything about how Windows looks and works, in some cases to access these very controls, or the built-in Windows programs requires you to engage in multiple clicks or know their names. 

Windows Access Panel is meant to minimize your trouble in accessing such programs. It has been tested on Windows 7 & Windows Vista. It can simply be downloaded and used as a portable application. Place it in your Programs Files and Pin its shortcut to your Start menu and you are all set to a faster way of accessing the AhiddenA Windows system utilities.

For instance, WAP will save you a couple of clicks if you want to open any program, like maybe the Disk Defragmentation utility. Or maybe you donAt know that to open the Backup or Restore Usernames & Passwords Wizard you need to type credwiz in the start search and hit Enter! 48 such programs have been included in WAP.

With this program, you have all, or atleast most of such programs at your fingertips. The present download is for 32-bit version only.
