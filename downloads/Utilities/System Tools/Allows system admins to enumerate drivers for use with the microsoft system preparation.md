**Publisher's Description**  
  


With the SysPrep Driver Scanner (SpDrvScn) you can very easily enumerate drivers for use with MicrosoftA's System Preparation Tool instead of manually entering data into the sysprep.infA's OEMPnPDriversPath. You can either use a graphical user interface (GUI) or execute it with command line parameters for use from a batch script. 

The layout of the program is fairly straightforward and all you need to provide it a starting folder path and when told to it will recursively search directories for system device drivers starting from that path, and then these entries will be saved into the registryA's DevicePath.
