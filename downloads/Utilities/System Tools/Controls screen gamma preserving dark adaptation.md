**Publisher's Description**  
  


DarkAdapted is a gamma control application program. It modifies your screen gamma settings so that you may, for example, preserve your dark adaptation while using your computer. 

DarkAdapted is being used by astronomers, planetarium operators, graphics professionals, medical professionals, airline pilots, air traffic controllers, and others worldwide to provide flexible, dynamic control over their monitorA's gamma (screen color response). Users may define an unlimited number of gamma presets, and invoke them via global hotkeys, by menu selection, or by typing the first few letters of a presetAs name.

**Features:**

  * DarkAdapted is free of charge (but remains copyrighted by Stephen E. Hutson). 
  * Customizable gamma presets. Use predefined settings, create your own, and manipulate your presets with ease. For example, use the ADark RedA setting to preserve your dark adaptation. Or create a preset to deal with monitor characteristics or viewing conditions. 
  * Adjust gamma values via sliders or from the keyboard. 
  * High-resolution sliders allow you to adjust red, green, and blue video components individually and in real time. Sliders can be set to report gamma values as percentages or as raw gamma values. 
  * Keyboard control of gamma color values, using raw gamma values or percentages. Switch between percentage/raw display with a press of the spacebar. 
  * Ganged Slider Mode allows you to control all three gamma components in unison, optionally preserving the gammaAs relative values between adjustments. 
  * Small screen mode hides advanced controls, minimizing the use of valuable screen real estate. The control window may also be hidden entirely. 
  * Select a preset by typing the first few letters of its name. 
  * Export and import gamma presets to and from disk files. Many sample presets files are included with the download. 
  * Full AppleScript support (on Mac OS), including a sample AppleScript with the Mac OS download. 
  * AGamma ToggleA keys offer a quick return to full brightness. Modifier keys are fully assignable, and display in the control window to remind you what they are. 
  * Switching to gamma presets is performed via smooth fades, never abrupt shifts in screen color or brightness. 
  * Gamma fade duration is user-configurable (from instantaneous to two seconds), and slider controls may be set to update in real time during the fade. 
  * Almost all windows ArememberA their positions on your screen. 
  * Saved gamma preset can be restored when DarkAdapted is launched, and reset when DarkAdapted quits. 
  * Automatic refresh preference can override gamma adjustments made by screen savers or other software. 
  * Automatic or manual checking for updates via the Internet. 
  * Useful display features show gamma changesA effects on selected text, as well as text on different backgrounds. 
  * Useful numeric and graphical readouts of gamma values.
