**Publisher's Description**  
  

ClickToClose is a tiny utility that allows you to click the upper right corner
of a Windows 8 Metro app (where the Close button should be) in order to close
it and switch back to the Desktop.

**Perfect for Windows 8 laptop owners and for people that rather work with the mouse and not use the touch screen.**

Download ClickToClose.zip, extract to any folder (there are 3 files in the
archive, a DLL file, an executable and a batch file to close the program) then
run ClickToClose.exe (you can also place a shortcut to ClickToClose.exe in the
Start Menu Startup folder).

  * The DLL and Executable must be in the same folder. 
  * There is no Exit button or Close button, you must end the ClickToClose.exe task from the Task Manager. You can also run the A'Close ClickToClose.batA' file. 
  * There is also the added benefit of double-clicking the upper right corner of the desktop to bring up the Shutdown Dialog.
