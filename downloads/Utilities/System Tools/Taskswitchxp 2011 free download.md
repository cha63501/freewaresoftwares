TaskSwitchXP is an advanced task management utility that picks up where the
standard Windows Alt+Tab switcher leaves off. It provides the same
functionality, and adds visual styles to the dialog and also enhances it by
displaying thumbnail preview of the application that will be switched to.
TaskSwitchXP also has a powerful process and window management capability that
allows you quickly to close/minimize applications and their groups. The unique
capabilities of TaskSwitchXP make it useful for tracking down multitudinous
windows, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications work.
