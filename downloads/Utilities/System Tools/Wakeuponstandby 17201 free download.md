**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you ever wondered if itA's possible to wake up your system from a Stand-
by mode programmatically? The answer is yes, itA's possible. This simple
utility will show you how. Once activated it resides in the system and wakes
it up at predefined time, runs a file and if necessary sends system back into
Stand-by mode. It could be also run from the Windows command line and be
minimized to a system tray to save space on the screen. We can also supply it
with a source code which will let you modify this concept for your own needs.

Special features:

  * Can restore almost every Windows operating system from a Stand-by mode that has Advanced Power Management (APM) enabled (Check Control Panel -> Power Options), and a hardware timer support; 
  * Can run a file at a predetermined time after a wake-up from Stand-by, or simply during normal operation; 
  * Can send system back to Stand-by mode after a certain time interval (provided your hardware supports it); 
  * Can detect if Stand-by mode is supported by your system; 
  * Has free source code file download that enables you to modify this concept according to your needs; 
  * New C++/MFC programmers can learn how to create Windows XP compatible dialog-based MFC applications, how to operate dialog window controls, how to run events on timer and Windows threads and synchronization model, how to subclass dialog controls for your specific needs (and to create HTML link in your dialog box in particular), how to enable your application to run from a system tray (area next to Windows system clock in the lower right corner), and much more.
