**Publisher's Description**  
  


If you are a power-save mode fan, you will appreciate this small utility, that will let you send your monitor to sleep with a keyboard shortcut. 

Of course, you can tell Windows to activate power-save mode after a time of inactivity, but a keyboard shortcut is the most flexible solution, letting you rely on your decision, instead of some automatic adjustment which sometimes strikes exactly a few seconds before you need your monitor again.

Sleeper lets you define whatever hot-key you prefer to run Sleeper and activate the power-save mode of your monitor.
