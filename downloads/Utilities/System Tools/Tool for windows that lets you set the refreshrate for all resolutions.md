HZ Tool is a freeware tool for Windows that lets you set the refreshrate for all resolutions, including the ones that Windows normally donA't let you use. You can also change resolution and bit-depth. 

Note that all graphics cards and drivers do not allow you to change the refreshrate or use unusual resolutions. The program gives you freedom to set whatever refreshrates and resolutions you want, but you have to make sure that both the graphics card and your monitor can handle it. Use precaution!
