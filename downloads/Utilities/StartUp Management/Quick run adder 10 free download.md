**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you had to reboot your PC because a Windows update was in course, but you
didnA't want to reboot because you had a lot of files open that you were
working on? Well, it happened to me... a lot.  
  
ThatA's why I created **Quick Run Adder**, a free portable software.  
  
What does it do? ItA's simple, imagine that you have the MS Outlook open, a
Word and an Excel document and also your favorite music player, but you need
to reboot Windows because of an update. With **Quick Run Adder** you just add
those documents, Outlook and music player to the Windows Startup and when you
logon into Windows, those documents and applications will open automatically.  
  
**Will this documents open everytime I logon in my Windows account?**   
  
The answer is no...And also yes... You can choose what to do! You can choose
to only start those documents one time or everytime the system reboots.
