**Publisher's Description**  
  


Do you have a ton of programs that start automatically each time Windows starts? Surely you are not using all of them right away, so there is no sense waiting for all of them to load and to start at the hourglass. Quick Startup allows you inspect, edit, temporary disable or delete such programs. 

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes a toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.
