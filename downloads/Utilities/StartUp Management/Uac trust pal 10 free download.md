**Publisher's Description**  
  

UAC Trust Pal will be your best friend when you need to add applications which
need administrator rights, to the Windows startup.

Since Windows Vista, Microsoft implemented the UAC (User Account Control) to
protect users from malicious software, specially the ones which adds
themselves to the Windows startup, to be executed at Windows logon, like
viruses.

However this type of 'extra' security doesnAt know 100% what kind of software
is malicious and what isnAt, which is a problem. Some programs you use have
the option to start with Windows to give you quick access to them, or simply
to check for updates. If the UAC doesnAt trust those software it will block it
at startup.

With UAC Trust Pal you can add any program to start at user logon bypassing
UAC.

UAC Trust Pal has a very simple intuitive interface and itAs very easy to use
in 3 simple steps.

Just press the 'Choose'button to select the program which will start when user
log on, add a 'Program name' or just leave the automatic chosen one and press
'Add it to startup' button.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
