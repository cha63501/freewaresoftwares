**Publisher's Description**  
  

This utility displays the list of all applications that are loaded
automatically when Windows starts up. For each application, the following
information is displayed: Startup Type (Registry/Startup Folder), Command-Line
String, Product Name, File Version, Company Name, Location in the Registry or
file system, and more.

It allows you to easily disable or delete unwanted programs that runs in your
Windows startup. You can use it on your currently running instance of Windows,
as well as you can use it on external instance of Windows in another drive.

WhatInStartup also supports a special "Permanent Disabling" feature - If a
program that you previously disabled added itself again to the startup list of
Windows, WhatInStartup will automatically detect the change and disable it
again.
