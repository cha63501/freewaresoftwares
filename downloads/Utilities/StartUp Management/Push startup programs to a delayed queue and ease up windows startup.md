Push startup programs to a delayed queue and ease up Windows startup. 

Instead of removing startup applications from the registry, use this startup utility to push your sidebar and devices utilities into a queue and allow them to be started after the initial memory and resources consumption race. This utility allows you to start using the computer faster.

Latest release does not require downloading .net 3.5 and allows disabling programs so thereA's no need to use msconfig.
