**Publisher's Description**  
  

SterJo Task Manager is an advanced utility for process managing which allows
you to get details on everything thatAs running on your computer. The program
is divided in several sections covering the main parts of each system.

"Tasks" section shows all running and not responding applications.

"Processes" gives you more details about each process and also could show you
the slowing down of the CPU with an option to terminate the process and
retrieve the speed of the computer. Also if the startup of your system is
significantly slower than previously known then the reason for that is
probably too much applications stored into the boot sequence.

"Registry" section can take care of this and exclude all those unnecessary
things in order to speed up the startup. This way you can optimize the Windows
startup time but be careful not to disable some crucial programs you are
using.

The "Services" shows Windows services and optionally installed drivers with
ability to stop or delete them.

The main thing that distinguishes this software from the standard Windows Task
Manager is the section "Connections". Here you can see all processes that
target the internet which could be quite useful for various analyses and
increase your safety. Saying in a few words this is a must-have application
for any computer user regardless his expertise if he wants to know what is
happening to the system.
