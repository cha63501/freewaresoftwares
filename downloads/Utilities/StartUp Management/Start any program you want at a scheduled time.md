**Publisher's Description**  
  


Smooth Program Scheduler will start any program you want at a scheduled time. It can perform both one-time and recurring tasks. If some program is enabled with a control interface built under the SchedulerA's specification, then you will get additional control over that program. Two sound recorders, Claudio and Audio Notes Recorder, represent a good example for that collaboration. If you have one of those recorders on your computer then you will be able to make unattended recordings using Smooth Program Scheduler. In other words you get the opportunity to create a scheduled task that will launch the audio program, start recording from a selected sound source, stop the recording at some point later in time and finally exit the program.
