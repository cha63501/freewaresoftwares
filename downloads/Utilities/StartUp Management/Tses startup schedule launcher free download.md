**Publisher's Description**  
  

There are many start up launchers and editors available. However, many of them
only let you enable or disable an item. What makes the Startup Schedule
Launcher handy is that it allows you to schedule which applications you want
started up by days of the week, and even by hour. For example, if you only
want to run AIM on startup on Thursday, and your organizer every Sunday after
5 PM, thatA's when it will start. You donA't need to let it load up on days
and times you donA't need it. It is good if you donA't leave your pc turned on
all the time.
