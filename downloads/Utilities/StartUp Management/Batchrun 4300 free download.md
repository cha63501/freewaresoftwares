**Publisher's Description**  
  

Batchrun is a graphical script creation tool that eliminates the need for
knowledge of arcane scripting languages to execute batches of commands. With
Batchrun .brs batch files you can launch any number of programs or dialup
connections with just a simple click. You can control the starting process
with many properties like priority or run mode and control their behavior a
tad.

You can even do more than starting programs with the built-in file management
functions like Copy, Rename, Makedir, Delete, End Process, Kill Process and
Text to Clipboard. Batchrun batch files can be launched from Explorer or
placed in StartUp folder or on the Desktop.

**Features:**

  * Launch files of any filetype and dialup connections 
  * Internal commands: Run, Copy, Rename, Makedir, Delete, DelTree, End Process, Kill Process, Text to Clipboard 
  * Wildcard support for Copy, Delete and DelTree 
  * Makedir nested folder creation 
  * Drag and Drop between Explorer and Batchrun 
  * Support for date and time tags 
  * Command line parameters can be passed to Batchrun script files 
  * Save batch files directly to Startup and Desktop 

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program offers to add a URL shortcut to BitsDuJour. This option can be unchecked during the installation process.
