**Publisher's Description**  
  


With Startup Delayer you can speed up WindowsA' boot: when Windows boots, it loads at the same time a lot of programs (ie: Antivirus, firewall, office quickstart bar, mouse manager, messenger...): this puts a high load on the hard disk (it has to read simultaneasly from totally different parts of the disk) and this saturates Ram and CPU (launching a new program is often resources expensive). ItA's easy to understand that, in this way, boot is really slow. 

With Startup Delayer instead you can set a delay time between the launch of every program to avoid overloading the system. You can choose how the programA's window will appear (maximized, minized, hidden, normal) and set a different priority to the progam (low, below norma, normal, above normal, high, realtime).

Startup Delayer can also be used to load every programs you want when you want: do you want to connect to the internet and open all the programs youA'll need?

Easy: for example you just have to click on one icon to make Startup Delayer do all this: open the firewall, the internet connection, the email client, the browser, the news feeder... YouA'll have the full control of what you want to be loaded.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx).
