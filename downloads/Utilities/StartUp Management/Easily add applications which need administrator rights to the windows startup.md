**Publisher's Description**  
  


UAC Trust Pal will be your best friend when you need to add applications which need administrator rights, to the Windows startup. 

Since Windows Vista, Microsoft implemented the UAC (User Account Control) to protect users from malicious software, specially the ones which adds themselves to the Windows startup, to be executed at Windows logon, like viruses.

However this type of 'extra' security doesnAt know 100% what kind of software is malicious and what isnAt, which is a problem. Some programs you use have the option to start with Windows to give you quick access to them, or simply to check for updates. If the UAC doesnAt trust those software it will block it at startup.

With UAC Trust Pal you can add any program to start at user logon bypassing UAC.

UAC Trust Pal has a very simple intuitive interface and itAs very easy to use in 3 simple steps.

Just press the 'Choose'button to select the program which will start when user log on, add a 'Program name' or just leave the automatic chosen one and press 'Add it to startup' button.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
