**Publisher's Description**  
  

Admit One lets you enable and disable all Windows password prompts with just
one mouse click - You wonA't be bothered by passwords while at home, and
youA'll always be prompted to prevent unauthorized use when on the go. Great
for desktop PCA's as well, where privacy and security are needed. This is your
first line of defense to prevent outsiders from using your computer if itA's
left unattended.

While all passwords prompts can be enabled and disabled using normal Windows
configuration dialogs, they are buried deep inside control panel and other
places, requiring many mouse clicks to get to them. Most users donA't remember
where and how to change them, and it is annoying at best. Therefore most users
are either using their computers with little or no security, or are constantly
annoyed by password prompts when such strong security is not warranted. Admit
One conveniently lets you enable and disable all passwords prompts with just
one mouse click. Admit One - donA't leave home without it!
