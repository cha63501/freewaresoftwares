**Publisher's Description**  
  

Push startup programs to a delayed queue and ease up Windows startup.

Instead of removing startup applications from the registry, use this startup
utility to push your sidebar and devices utilities into a queue and allow them
to be started after the initial memory and resources consumption race. This
utility allows you to start using the computer faster.

Latest release does not require downloading .net 3.5 and allows disabling
programs so thereA's no need to use msconfig.
