**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ashampoo StartUp Tuner 2 lists all auto-start entries and allows them to be individually deleted or to be deactivated. If the user proceeds with caution in this area, and at least deactivates all of the unnecessary entries, then they will be able to enjoy a clearly faster start to Windows. 

The new Ashampoo StartUp Tuner 2 can do more than just this though. The tool is also in the position of being able to designate all Windows services by name A to allow their subsequent activation or deactivation with the click of the mouse. At this point, the deactivation of the annoying Windows error notification service is also possible. The Windows notification service should also be deactivated, as it allows spammers to send messages directly to the screen of the unsuspecting user.

The Ashampoo StartUp Tuner 2 displays all installed Windows programs but builds its lists clearly more quickly than the control panel software module. Here, it is possible to uninstall programs that are no longer required so that they can be removed from the computer without Aleaving behind tracksA as it were.

IT specialists know that the acronym BHO stands for ABrowser Helper ObjectA. BHOs concern plugins for the internet explorer. These plugins rapidly cluster in alarmingly large numbers on the userAs computer. Some of them are useful, but others are superfluous to requirements A or downright dangerous. The Ashampoo StartUp Tuner 2 lists all of them, and allows them to be individually deleted or deactivated if they are no longer needed.

**Free registration**  
The Ashampoo StartUp Tuner 2 can be used free of charge for 10 days. Subsequent to this time, a free online registration is then required in order to receive an activation code which will convert the test version of the program into a full version which can be used over the long term.
