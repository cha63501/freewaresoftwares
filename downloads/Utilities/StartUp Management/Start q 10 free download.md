**Publisher's Description**  
  

Start-Q allows startup items (those programs or files that were set to be
automatically run each time a user logged in to Windows) to start in a more
orderly fashion.

This is done by setting how many seconds must elapsed after a user login
before launching each startup item. This ordering makes you gain control of
the system much faster, and the startup items will launch faster as they
donA't have to compete for resources with each other.

With Start-Q you also have full control of how your startup application
launched. You can specify the priority of the launched application, make sure
one is finished before launched the next, and much more!
