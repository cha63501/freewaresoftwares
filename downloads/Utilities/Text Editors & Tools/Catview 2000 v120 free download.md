**Publisher's Description**  
  

CatView2000 searches plain text files on a line by line basis. It is therefore
useful for text files that are catalogs or lists of things (where each line
represents a record or item).

Although it is possible to search line-delimited files with a A'FindA' feature
in a word-processor or web browser, this will not cater for finding groups of
words or returning a list of matching lines. Using the A'FindA' method, it is
usually necessary to iterate through all the matches in a document until you
locate the one youA're looking for. If it is a large file, this can be very
tedious.

With CatView2000, files are searched by specifying up to 3 keywords. These
keywords can use case sensitivity, boolean (AND/OR) and wildcards. CatView
will then search the file and copy all matching lines into a grid for viewing
and manipulation.

Once a search is completed in CatView, the results can then be A'savedA',
A'appendedA', A'printedA', etc. It is also possible to search multiple files
in one go.

CatView is configurable and represents a complete yet simple catalog-file
search and results gathering solution.
