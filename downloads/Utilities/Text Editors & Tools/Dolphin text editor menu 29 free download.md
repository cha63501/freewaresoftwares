**Publisher's Description**  
  

Many text editors are lacking when it comes to basic text manipulation. (e.g.
Notepad is frequently used to edit files, but it has only the most basic of
text editing functions.)

Dolphin Text Editor Menu expands the functionality of any text editor by
adding an extra menu allowing you to: sort text alphabetically; reverse line
order; remove blank lines; change case to upper/lower/title; remove duplicate
lines; add text to lines; and more.

Dolphin Text Editor Menu gives you numerous text formatting tools, but only
shows itself when it is needed.

So, if you are changing source code; editing html/php; writing a report; or
simply making notes - then Dolphin Text Editor Menu can make your life easier.
Dolphin Text Editor Menu doesnA't replace your current text editing software.
Instead, it makes your text editors better.

Free for personal, non-commercial use.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
