**Publisher's Description**  
  

EditPad Lite is a convenient, carefully designed text editor and Notepad
replacement.

It has all the features a solid text editor needs without any bloat.You can
open as many files at a time as you want, with no arbitrary file size limit
and no arbitrary line length limit. You change between the open files by
clicking on their tabs. No hassle with heaps of overlapping windows.

If you want, EditPad Lite limits itself to one instance, saving you a lot of
task switching, and keep an icon visible in the system tray, for quick
access.Save time with the Search and replace that can work across all open
files. Reduce frustration with the unlimited undo and redo, which can undo
changes even after saving them.

EditPad Lite is fully globalized. You can convert between ANSI, ASCII and
Unicode (UCS-2 and UTF-8), and work with Unix and Mac files. Create text files
in any language you like, whether thatA's English, French, Russian or
Chinese). EditPad Lite itself has also been translated into many languages,
including all documentation.
