**Publisher's Description**  
  

Subpad is a lightweight notepad clone with all of the features of Windows
notepad, with just a few extras added. The main purpose was to make another
notepad, but with faster find/replace features and a most recent documents.
The find/replace is perhaps one of the fastest out there. Other minor
convenient features that have been added, without adding too much bloat are:
close on ESC, roll-up caption bar (like in Linux), toggle off/on URL
highlighting, column selection mode and stay on top. The file is distributed
in a simple zip -- so you can run it on a USB, to uninstall, just delete it.
