FTEditor is an editor for Fielded Text files (see http://www.fieldedtext.org). It lets you visually and interactively create and edit the Meta for a Fielded Text file. It also lets you edit a Fielded Text file with a simultaneous text and grid view. 

The editor is also an excellent tool for viewing and modifying Fielded Text files (such as CSV files). It can simultaneously display a file in an text edit window and a grid window. Color highlighting of columns make it easy to determine which column each field belongs to. Also the value of the field under the cursor and the mouse is highlighted and information about these values is displayed.
