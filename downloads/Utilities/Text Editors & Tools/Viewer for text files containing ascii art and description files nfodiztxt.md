**Publisher's Description**  
  


Compact NFO Viewer is a popular utility designed for viewing text files containing ASCII Art (e.g. nfo files), and it proved itself to be handy. 

So, if youA're fed up with starting a DOS-like file manager each time you need to view an NFO file, or are not too happy with the viewer you use, or (worst case) use Notepad - give this little tool a try.

**Features:**

  * Instantly load and display NFO files 
  * Compact, light, simple and flexible 
  * URL detection: The viewer automatically extracts hyperlinks addresses and shows them as clickable items 
  * Customizable appearance. You can set text/background colors and text font. 
  * Shell integration: the viewer can be set as the default application to open files with .nfo and .diz extensions. 
  * Unlimited file size. While other similar programs are limited at 512K, Dark NFO Viewer can open files on any size. 
  * Embedded help system (help as tooltips) 
  * Compact. It is delivered as one single EXE file. 
  * It doesnA't need to be installed/uninstalled (just download the "exe" file and double click it) 
  * It doesnA't mess your registry or system with unneeded DLLs or other craps like this 
  * It is really small 
  * It is FREE! 
Does not require installation. Simply download and run the .exe file.
