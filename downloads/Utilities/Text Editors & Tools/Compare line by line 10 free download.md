**Publisher's Description**  
  

There are several programs available that compare two files, but this is one
of the only programs that also works when you compare two files where the
linenumbers are scrambled.

More specific it checks each and every line from the first selected file and
prints this line if an equal line isnA't found in the second file (and vice-
versa).
