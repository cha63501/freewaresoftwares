**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pipelines is a utility which allows you to modify the contents of a text file or files, quickly and easily. You can specify that only certain sections of a file are to be changed; you can confine those changes to a column, word or field range, translate words and phrases, discard or insert new lines of text. 

Pipelines builds on the concept of directing the output of one process to the input of another; commonly known as pipelining. However, Pipelines takes an extra step; allowing you to build multi-stream pipes, where the topology of the pipeline is no longer horizontal and linear, but two-dimensional; where the records travel up and down the pipeline chain, into and out of intersecting joints which control the flow of data. This mechanism allows you to construct pipelines which process data in a single pass without the need to buffer and/or sort the data to re-adjust record sequencing.
