Two tools for reading and writing nfo files. 

Nfo files are a form of tag art, that many people distibute around the internet. Originating from the old BBS days, when people where in low baud modems!

The reader is a compact application with selectable font size, color theme and more. It intergrates into windows on install, so your nfos are a click of the mouse away.

The artpad application is a freeform nfo creator. You can draw on text much like a paint canvas, and easily whip up an nfo in minutes.
