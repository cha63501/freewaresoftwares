**Publisher's Description**  
  

RegEx Builder is a small utility to help you build regular expressions.
Especially useful for those, like me, who donAt use regular expressions
everyday, and therefore, donAt always remember all the details.

RegEx Builder does not eat too much memory, it is easy to install and has a
simple but efficient interface.

What is a regular expression? A regular expression is a string that is used to
describe or match a set of strings, according to certain syntax rules.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
