**Publisher's Description**  
  


TXTcollector grabs all .txt files from the directory of your choice and combines them into a new (larger) text file. This can come in handy: I use TXTcollector myself to grab a CD full of readmeA's to enable me to read them all in one go. At work I use it to combine daily and weekly reports and to combine server backup logs. Some users find this application perfect for combining their network log files. 

**Features:**

  * Grabs all .txt files from a directory and combines them 
  * Puts directory-, file name and separator between each text file 
  * Possibility to add your own extensions and separators 
  * Popup list with files ready to be merged 
  * Able to recursively search directories 
  * Runs on Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000/2003/XP/Vista/7
