**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is a free Journal application that runs on your PC and your PDA. It uses a storage card to run from and to store data to. See the PDATextEditor to find out why you would want to save data to your storage card. The idea is you keep all the files on the storage card in your PDA (mobile phone) then when in an internet cafe set the PDA to mass storage only and run the PCJournal from the phone, it will see the same data as the PDAJournal and not require any install on the target PC. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-x-Final_program_16026.html).
