**Publisher's Description**  
  

Big File Viewer is an application specifically designed to handle large files.
If you load a large (e.g. 200Mb) text file into Notepad then it will try and
load the whole thing into memory before displaying. Big File Viewer loads the
file in chunks and not all in one go so you are able to scan through the file
quickly. As you change the scroll bar on the right you skip your way through
the file and can fast-forward to any part of the file instantly. Supports
variable chunk lengths from 256 A 4096 bytes.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-x-Final_program_16026.html).
