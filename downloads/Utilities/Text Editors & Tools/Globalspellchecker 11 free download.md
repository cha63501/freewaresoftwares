**Publisher's Description**  
  

GlobalSpellChecker is a tool for checking spelling or meaning of words from
any application using Microsoft Word. It displays the meaning or spelling
suggestion in a non-disturbing way so that you do not have to shift from the
application you are working. You can copy the word to be checked to Clipboard
by pressing Ctrl+C and invoke GlobalSpellChecker using hotkey Ctrl+Alt+S.

When spelling suggestions are displayed, copy any suggestion to clipboard by
pressing itA's corresponding number. Display time of spelling suggestions and
meanings is configurable. Unlike other programs in this category,
GlobalSpellchecker is loaded in memory only when called and exits after
spelling check is complete.
