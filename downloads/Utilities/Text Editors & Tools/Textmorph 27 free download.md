**Publisher's Description**  
  

TextMorph, is called as such because that is essentially what it does - it
morphs text. It is a full text editor (like Notepad) except it also does so
much more. It can perform such actions as quickly cleaning up forwarded emails
(removing all those ">" signs, etc.), converting text to and from HTML,
searching and replacing text (including multiple paragraphs of text), changing
upper/lower case, removing trailing carriage returns, etc., all with the push
of a button.

WhatA's more is it can also repetitively do these tasks across large numbers
of files (using TextMorphA's Multiple File Morph wizard). For instance, if you
have 500 text files, you can, in less than a minute, convert all 500 of them
to HTML files complete with all of the formatting that you wish in the files
(such as background image, etc.) This makes TextMorph an ideal program for
people who work with large numbers of text files or archives of HTML or text
content, as it can quickly and easily apply formatting to all files.

But most people can benefit from TextMorph if for no other reason than using
it to quickly "clean up" forwarded emails. TextMorph is a fairly simple
program to use, but it is also very powerful and provides many advanced
options including command line processing of files. For programmers, TextMorph
will actually allow you to create your own programs that act just like one of
the built-in "tools."
