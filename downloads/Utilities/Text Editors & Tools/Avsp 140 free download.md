AvsP is at its core a tabbed text editor with features specific for creating
AviSynth scripts. It is a unique application that has text editing features
such as AviSynth-specific syntax highlighting and autocompletion to simplify
the task of writing scripts. However, its primary advantage over other editors
is its integrated video preview, which remains attached to the main window at
all times.

AvsP doesnA't require program installation, doesnA't write to the registry,
and doesnA't require installing any additional framework. To run the program,
simply unzip it to a directory of your choosing and double-click AvsP.exe.
