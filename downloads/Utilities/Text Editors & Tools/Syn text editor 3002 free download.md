**Publisher's Description**  
  

Syn is an Open Source Text and Programming Editor with Syntaxhighlight for
many Languages, and some IDE Features, like starting an application (e.g.
Compiler) and capture the output, support for Projects etc. Syn is written in
Delphi (Version 5, Updatepack 1) for maximum performance, stability and
filesize ;-), hence it doesnA't require any bulky VC++/VB Runtime or MFC
libraries!

Syn supports Active Scripting, this means you can extend the functionallity
with writing a Script. If you have written such a Script, or an other file
(Autocomplete file or whatever), and you think it could be useful for others,
just send them to me or to the Users Mailinglist (syn-
users[at]lists[dot]sourceforge[dot]net), and we will add them. Of course, we
will give you proper credits. Many thanks to all of you!
