**Publisher's Description**  
  

TextWrapper is a drag-and-drop enabled memo lines reformatting utility capable
of manipulating and shrinking the width of your text into a customized form
that fits your requirements for a special text processing purpose.

Use it when you need to make sure that:

  * your text will not wrap improperly breaking into orphaned words moved to the next lines 
  * the destination memo does not have wordwrap enabled 
  * the destination memo has wordwrap enabled but itA's set larger than your screen width and you would have to use the horizontal scroller to view the text and access it, etc. 
TextWrapper is a compact self-contained application consisting of a single
file so it doesnA't have to be installed - just copy and run it from anywhere,
even from a removable medium. Truly portable program and great addition for
anyone working with text and processing texts for customized targets.
