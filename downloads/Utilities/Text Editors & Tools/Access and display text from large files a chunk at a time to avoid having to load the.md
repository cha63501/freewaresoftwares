**Publisher's Description**  
  


Big File Viewer is an application specifically designed to handle large files. If you load a large (e.g. 200Mb) text file into Notepad then it will try and load the whole thing into memory before displaying. Big File Viewer loads the file in chunks and not all in one go so you are able to scan through the file quickly. As you change the scroll bar on the right you skip your way through the file and can fast-forward to any part of the file instantly. Supports variable chunk lengths from 256 A 4096 bytes. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-x-Final_program_16026.html).
