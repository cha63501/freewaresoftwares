**Publisher's Description**  
  


MoonEdit is a collaborative text editor software which allows many users over the internet to edit the same document in the same time. 

Every user can modify documents at any place or time - without restriction. You can watch other peopleA's cursor movements in real time as they make changes. Each user writes text in their own color so you can easily tell who wrote what.

Also included are a few bells & whistles, such as simulating the typing sound of a keyboard (so you know when others are making changes), an in-line equation evaluator (so you donA't need to open a separate window for a calculator), and even a rudimentary music sequencer!

**Features:**

  * Multi-platform collaborative multi-user text editor 
  * Formerly known as Multi-Editoro 
  * See many cursors changing text in realtime! 
  * Remote text editing without latency 
  * Users can view the history of changes from a multi-user edit session 
  * Keyboard typing sound simulation 
  * Built-in calculator and music sequencer
