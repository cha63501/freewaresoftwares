**Publisher's Description**  
  

QuillEdit is an enhanced notepad (maybe wordpad also) replacement. It includes
all the features in notepad plus Math equation editor, Symbolic calculator,
graph plotter, FirEdit syntax highlighter, spelling checker, word counter, and
MDI interfaces.

However, QuillEdit is still in its very young stage. Hence, it is still not
wise for production use.
