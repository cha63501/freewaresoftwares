**Publisher's Description**  
  

minipad2 is a tiny program which integrates many useful functions including
notepad, calculator, reminder, dictionary, launcher, address list, text
template & clipboard-enhancement, with very low system-requirement and memory
take-up. All the contents are automatically saved while minimized or closed,
and when re-opened the last state will be restored.

The program can be freely switched between two styles: multi-page style and
treeview style. When no longer used, it can be minimized to the system-tray,
or hide outside of the desktop.

The program provides very flexible configurations. Besides the basic notepad
function, all the other extended functions (calculator, reminder...) are like
plug-ins which can be freely enabled or disabled in the options.

minipad2 is a single-exe green software. It can be directly used when unzipped
to any directory without installation. It adds no key to the system registry,
except for the "Run" key when set as start with windows.

OS: Win2000/XP/2003/Vista  
System Requirements: No special requirements.
