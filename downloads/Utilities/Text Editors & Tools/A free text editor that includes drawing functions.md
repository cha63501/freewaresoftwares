**Publisher's Description**  
  


Paper is a plain text editor with a twist. You can draw into it at any point freely, without switching tools or fiddling with options/modes. Simply type when you want, and draw when you want by holding the right mouse button down and drawing with the left mouse button, allowing for drawing functionality without getting in the way of normal text editing functionality. There are also several drawing tools and a color select in the drawing context menu which is opened by holding the left mouse button down and right clicking. 

Paper also has other cool features as well such as temporary highlighting, collapsible lines, and a built-in binary editor as well. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.3:**

  * You can also access the drawing menu from the text menu. 
  * The font is a bit bigger.
