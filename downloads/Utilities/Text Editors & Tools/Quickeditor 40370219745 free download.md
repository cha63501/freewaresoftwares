**Publisher's Description**  
  

QuickEditor is a free, small and light-weight notepad which is always ready
for your input. If you do not need QuickEditor, it will hide itself in the
left "screen-frame" and will stay there until you move your mouse-cursor to
the left side of your screen. Then QuickEditor will instantly pop-up and is
ready for your input. QuickEditor is designed to run always in the background
and if you instantly need a place to put information in, you can use
QuickEditor.

**Why use QuickEditor instead of Notepad or something else?**  
Notepad is nice, but you always have to start if, if you need it. It is always
there and visible in the windows taskbar. Most of the time you donA't need it
and inn most cases (if you need it), it is not started and not ready for your
input. QuickEditor is different. QuickEditor started once on system-startup is
always ready for your information. It is always on-standby "inside" the left
"screen-border". You just have to move your mouse-cursor to the left side of
the screen and QuickEditor is instantly visible and has the focus to grab your
information.
