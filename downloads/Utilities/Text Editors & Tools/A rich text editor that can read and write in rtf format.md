**Publisher's Description**  
  


MyEditor is a rich text editor that can read and write in rtf format. You can open or save file with the extention of .rtf or .mye (the default). 

MyEditor has the features of most rtf editors including undo, cut, copy, paste, delete, indent, bullets, font formating, text color, and text alignment.

It also has typewriter sounds that can be turned on or off and a button that opens up MyMusicMachine (included in this package), a small audio player that I created that plays mp3 or midi files.
