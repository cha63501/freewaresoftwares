Little Registry Cleaner is an open source program designed for MicrosoftA's Windows Registry. Its purpose is to remove obsolete or unwanted items that build up in the registry over time in order to improve the stability and performance of your computer. 

These items may include un-needed or inaccurate entries left behind by incomplete uninstall routines (known as "Software Rot"), application program errors, and even misapplied registry hacks. Problems also come up when users transfer or delete files without realizing that dozens of Registry entries aim to the old location.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
