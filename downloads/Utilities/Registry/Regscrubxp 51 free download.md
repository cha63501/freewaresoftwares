**Publisher's Description**  
  

A freeware registry cleaner/viewer program. RegScrubXP was designed not only
for casual users to safely repair the registry, but allows advanced users and
IT professionals to view customized defined sections of the registry on a
regular basis. This can significantly assist in deleting unwanted entries as a
result of un-clean uninstalls and programmer errors, or malicious attempts to
destroy the registry.

When problem results are displayed, you can even have Windows Explorer browse
right to the folder of the missing file reference, and have RegEdit browse
right to the referenced key. This saves significant time in verifying problems
that RegScrubXP detects.

Every repair that RegScrubXP performs can be completely and quickly restored.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
