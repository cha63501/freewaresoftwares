**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Registry is the heart and soul of any Windows system. It contains
information that controls how your system appears and how it behaves. Most
applications today use the registry to store configurations and other
important data. When you install an application, new registry entries will be
created. These entries automatically will be deleted when you uninstall the
application. Unfortunately, this process does not always work. Sometimes, some
applications fail to remove their own registry entries. These entries become
obsolete.

After a long period, after you install and uninstall a number of applications,
your Windows Registry will contain a large number of obsolete entries. This
will significantly increase the registry size and thus slow down your
computer, because Windows will need more time to load, search, and read data
from the registry. To keep your computer at top performance, it is recommended
you periodically clean your Windows Registry.
