**Publisher's Description**  
  


What Changed is a simple utility that searches for modified files and registry entries. It is useful for checking program installations. 

There are two steps for using What Changed: 

  1. First, take a snapshot of the state of the system 
  2. Second, run What Changed again to see the differences from the previous snapshot. 

What Changed uses the "brute force method" to check files and the registry. Since it is a free tool, no support is provided. Also, as a quick and dirty utility, it might be in need of various user-friendly features, but hey, itA's free.
