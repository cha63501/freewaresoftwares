If you have installed and uninstalled several programs on your computer, the
computerAs Windows registry most likely contains errors that affect its
performance. The more you use your computer, the more junk its registry will
accumulate. Some common errors are missing referenced application paths,
unused registration entries, missing references to shared DLLs, startup, Start
menu and sub-system components. However, it is not recommended that you tamper
with Windows registry unless you are sure of what you are doing. This is why
you need a suitable program that will help you fix registry errors without
creating further damage. Wise Registry Cleaner is such a program.

This free registry cleaner provides information about entries you can remove
and those you should not interfere with. It also creates a backup of original
entries before deleting anything.

**Features**

_Fast and Safe_

Wise Registry Cleaner uses a breakthrough algorithm that allows it to scan the
entire Windows registry in just a few seconds. The program also allows you to
undo your operations and restore your system to its former state.

_Cleaning Windows Registry_

The program helps to fix registry errors by removing invalid, redundant,
temporary and obsolete registry items.

_Defragmenting Registry_

The free registry cleaner analyzes Windows registry and defragments it so it
becomes tidier and more efficient.

_Tuning up the System_

The system tune-up feature stabilizes computer and network to make them
faster.

**Using Wise Registry Cleaner**

The user interface allowed us to access various functions easily. The left of
the program window displayed all registry areas we wanted to scan in a tree
view while the right part of the window displayed results of scans. At the
bottom of the application window were details of selected list entries and
number of problems found.

Many registry cleaners only offer the option to clean Windows registry without
differentiating between entries. However, Wise Registry Cleaner labeled
different entries as either unsafe or safe to fix. In addition, we liked the
back-up feature that we could use to restore our system in case we noticed any
problems. The first time we launched the program, it created a restore point
that saved all configurations in Windows before making any changes.

The software detected more errors than other similar programs. Although the
program did not remove as many errors on the first run, it removed all of them
the second time we ran it.

The program gave us the option to exclude some areas during the scanning
process. We could also choose the areas we wanted to fix or let the program
choose them automatically.

**Pros**

  * Easy to use 
  * Ability to restore former state 
  * Pausing and resuming scanning 
  * Showing safe and unsafe areas to fix 

**Cons**

  * Inability to fix all registry errors at first run
