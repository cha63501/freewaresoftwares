**Publisher's Description**  
  

System Path Commander is a tool which makes it easy to temporarily enable and
disable directories in the system path, rearrange their order, convert paths
to short form to reduce space, identify invalid paths, and add new
directories. Such a tool is useful in a variety of situations. For example,
the System Path sometimes grows too large and can cause problems if it isnA't
shortened. Being able to temporarily disable and enable directories on your
system path can be a great way to do this safely, while still keeping all the
paths available to you should you decide to re-enable them at a later time.
