**Publisher's Description**  
  

A neat little freeware utility that opens RegEdit (the Registry Editor) and
goes straight to the Key you want. You can also have RegEdit open at My
Computer or open at the last Key you opened. You can download Open RegEdit
from our Download Center.

Open RegEdit also will read a Registry Key for you. You can manually read most
Keys but Binary Keys need to be interpreted. Open RegEdit will display the
value both as numeric and as a string. Not all Binary Keys are numeric so it
interprets them both ways. It also can tell the Keys properties, such as how
many values, subkey and the date and time the Key was last written to.

If you want to go to the Key is HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ CLSID\
{00028C03-0000-0000-0000-000000000046}, simply select the Hive
"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\" and type in "CLSID\\{00028C" and it will take you to the
closest Key.

Open RegEdit can store a list for favorite Keys as well as recent Keys
visited. You can have Open RegEdit remember up to 20 of your favorite Keys you
have visited.
