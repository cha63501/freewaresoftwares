**Publisher's Description**  
  


Registry Smoker is a free utility that scans for and removes invalid Windows Registry entries. What makes Registry Smoker unique is the method used to find and remove the invalid entries. 

Rather than finding invalid registry entries and simply removing them, Registry Smoker triple checks the invalid entry to ensure the registry entry is actually invalid. Once this is determined, the entry is then added to the list of invalid entries.

Since making changes to the Windows Registry can render your system unusable and unstable if done improperly, Registry Smoker backs up the removed entries in case a mistake is made.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes 3rd Party Software which does not have to be installed to use the software.
