**Publisher's Description**  
  

RegAlyzer is a tool to browse and change the registry. It was created because
of a few features we missed in the original regedit tool, from support for
exotic value types over background and regular expression search to better
bookmarks, displaying .reg files in the accustomed style and a history view.

**Features:**

  * New: Undo and Redo logs in .reg format 
  * Improved search function (results list) 
  * Hierarchical bookmark support 
  * Jump to key by command line parameter 
  * Jump to key by typing/copying it into dialog (instead of browsing) 
  * DWord editing with parallel hex/decimal/binary display 
  * Support of QWord (64 bit integer) 
  * Display of .reg file contents without importing it 
  * Support of version 5 files (Unicode) even with Windows 95/NT 
  * Low-level display of security settings with option to export it 
  * Complete Unicode support 
  * Display and import support for some system stuff (REG_LINK, REG_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR, etc.) 
  * Changing security settings 
  * Remote connection doesnA't ask login yet 
  * Changing opened .reg file 
  * Editing binary data 
  * Working (add/delete/etc.) in remote registry
