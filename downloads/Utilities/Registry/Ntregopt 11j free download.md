**Publisher's Description**  
  

NTREGOPT will minimize the size of the registry files and optimize registry
access. The program works by recreating each registry hive "from scratch",
thus removing any slack space that may be left from previously modified or
deleted keys. The program does not change the contents of the registry in any
way, nor does it defrag the registry files "on-disk" (as the PageDefrag
program from SysInternals does).
