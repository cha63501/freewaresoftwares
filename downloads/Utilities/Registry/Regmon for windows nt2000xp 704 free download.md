**Publisher's Description**  
  

Regmon is a Registry monitoring utility that will show you which applications
are accessing your Registry, which keys they are accessing, and the Registry
data that they are reading and writing - all in real-time. This advanced
utility takes you one step beyond what static Registry tools can do, to let
you see and understand exactly how programs use the Registry. With static
tools you might be able to see what Registry values and keys changed.
