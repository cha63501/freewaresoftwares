**Publisher's Description**  
  

Registry Smoker is a free utility that scans for and removes invalid Windows
Registry entries. What makes Registry Smoker unique is the method used to find
and remove the invalid entries.

Rather than finding invalid registry entries and simply removing them,
Registry Smoker triple checks the invalid entry to ensure the registry entry
is actually invalid. Once this is determined, the entry is then added to the
list of invalid entries.

Since making changes to the Windows Registry can render your system unusable
and unstable if done improperly, Registry Smoker backs up the removed entries
in case a mistake is made.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes 3rd Party Software which does not have to be installed to use the software.
