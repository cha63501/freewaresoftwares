**Publisher's Description**  
  


A neat little freeware utility that opens RegEdit (the Registry Editor) and goes straight to the Key you want. You can also have RegEdit open at My Computer or open at the last Key you opened. You can download Open RegEdit from our Download Center. 

Open RegEdit also will read a Registry Key for you. You can manually read most Keys but Binary Keys need to be interpreted. Open RegEdit will display the value both as numeric and as a string. Not all Binary Keys are numeric so it interprets them both ways. It also can tell the Keys properties, such as how many values, subkey and the date and time the Key was last written to.

If you want to go to the Key is HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ CLSID\ {00028C03-0000-0000-0000-000000000046}, simply select the Hive "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\" and type in "CLSID\\{00028C" and it will take you to the closest Key.

Open RegEdit can store a list for favorite Keys as well as recent Keys visited. You can have Open RegEdit remember up to 20 of your favorite Keys you have visited.
