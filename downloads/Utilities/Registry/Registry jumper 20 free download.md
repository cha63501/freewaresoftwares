**Publisher's Description**  
  

Registry Jumper is a small and simple utility that enables one to quickly jump
to a specific registry path, without having to navigate there with RegEdit. It
also supports command-line launching and can handle custom protocol calls
(regjump://) to launch RegEdit from URLs. Additionally, Registry Jumper allows
to add the most frequently used registry locations to Favorites, organize
them, and export to HTML format.
