RegFromApp monitors the Registry changes made by the application that you

contains all the Registry changes made by the application. You can use the
generated .reg file to import these changes with RegEdit when itA's needed.

**System Requirements:** This utility works on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista (32-bit only). Older versions of Windows are not supported.

**WhatA's New in version 1.31:**

  * When you try to trace 32-bit program from RegFromApp 64-bit, it now clearly instructs you to use the 32-bit version of RegFromApp. (In previous versions it displayed 'Error code: 65518')
