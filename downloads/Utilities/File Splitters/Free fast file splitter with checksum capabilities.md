**Publisher's Description**  
  


EZSplit is a free program that allows you to split large file into smaller, more manageable parts. These smaller parts are much easier to transfer via e-mail or data storage device. 

**Why use EZSplit?**

  * For starters, if all youA're looking for is cutting files up, EZSplit works much faster than archivers such as winrar.

  * EZSplit creates a tiny auto-rebuilder to be sent along with split files making it much faster and easier to join your files again, especially if youA're sending them to a non computer savvy person. 
  * EZSplit integrates into explorer, allowing you to simply double click on your split files to join them. 
  * EZSplit reports progress information and speeds so you can see how well your computer is performing. It also supports pausing and can process multiple files at the same time. 
  * EZSplit now supports file hashing, with 6 hashing algorithms to choose from, including MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 and RIPEMD160. It can even calculate the checksum of the outcome of a split file to check if any data has been lost/changed! 
Requires: .Net framework 2.0 to run, and .Net framework 3.5 for the checksum features. Changelog from 2.0 to 2.0.1 
  * Hashing bugs fixed. 
  * Hashing speeds slightly improved.
