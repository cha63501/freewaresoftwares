**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free File Splitter enables you to easily split large files into smaller ones,
and creates a small executable file that can automatically rejoin the parts to
recreate the original file. This means that you can send the smaller parts to
anyone, and he can rejoin them without having to use this software (this is
especially handy for transferring large files via email).

This program can also be used to split large files into smaller parts so that
they could be stored in floppy disks or CDs. There are no limitations on the
file size, meaning that you can use the program to split huge files into any
size you wish.
