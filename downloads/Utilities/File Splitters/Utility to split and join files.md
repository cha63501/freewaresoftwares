**Publisher's Description**  
  


File Segregator is a program that splits and joins files without generating any special file formats, headers, or irreversible settings. The idea is to split up large files that would otherwise produce errors transferring over a network or for easy and compatible storage on CD-R/W, DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, DVD-RAM disks. It can also be used as a substitute for archive formats (.zip, .rar, etcA) where one desires to split up their large file into multiple smaller files.
