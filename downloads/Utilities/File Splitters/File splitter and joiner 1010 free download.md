**Publisher's Description**  
  

File Splitter and Joiner is a freeware program to split and recombine files.
The program is actually available on Windows platforms.

This free software enables you to split a file into several chunks, and then
join them together to recreate the original file. It somewhat resembles the
principle of a compression tool - you split a file into smaller chunks, copy
or move them into the desired source, then put them back together into the
original piece.

Installing the tool is a straighforward process, and it enables you to
integrate the software within the context menu of windows Explorer, thus
getting access to its features with very little effort.
