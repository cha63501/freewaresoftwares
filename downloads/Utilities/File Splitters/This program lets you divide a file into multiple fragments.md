**Publisher's Description**  
  


FileDivider is an application designed to allow you to divide a file into smaller sized fragments. If you have a file that is too big for a floppy or CD/DVD, you can divide the file into fragments, and copy the fragments to multiple floppies, or CDs/DVDs. FileDivider also allows you to merge the fragments back to a single file. 

When dividing a file into fragments, FileDivider can delete your file after it has been loaded into memory to prevent extra disk space from being used by the fragments. When merging the fragments together, FileDivider can also delete the fragments after they have been loaded to memory to prevent no extra disk space from being used by the merged file.

A Full Uninstall Application is included, as well a UserA's Manual.
