gtk-splitter can split files into smaller pieces and combine them back
together. It can also generate a DOS batch file so that the split files can be
combined on DOS/Windows systems. gtk-splitter is good for working around file
limitations with floppy disks, email attachments, etc. Binaries are available
on the project web site.
