**Publisher's Description**  
  


File Splitter and Joiner is a freeware program to split and recombine files. The program is actually available on Windows platforms. 

This free software enables you to split a file into several chunks, and then join them together to recreate the original file. It somewhat resembles the principle of a compression tool - you split a file into smaller chunks, copy or move them into the desired source, then put them back together into the original piece.

Installing the tool is a straighforward process, and it enables you to integrate the software within the context menu of windows Explorer, thus getting access to its features with very little effort.
