**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program makes possible to divide a file into several smaller files and to join again. This is practical if you want to accommodate big files on several diskettes or other media. It comes configured with some of the common media sizes (Floppy, CD etc.) and can also use custom sizes. 

The program can create a batch file, that can later join the split files. Splitting also integrates into the Windows Explorer right click menu and files can be split via the SendTo menu.
