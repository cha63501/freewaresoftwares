**Publisher's Description**  
  

When you need to exchange data between computers, some files may appear too
large to fit into the transport media or to be uploaded to the Internet.
SplitIt System is a program that is able to split large files into smaller
pieces, adding an executable self-assembler to reconstruct a copy of the
original file.
