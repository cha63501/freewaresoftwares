**Publisher's Description**  
  


This application is a free reliable file splitter that lets you split your large files (like Self-Extracting archives, Zip archives, disk images, multimedia, music, video, backup, image, archive, log, large text, document files...) into a set of smaller files called pieces. 

These pieces are easier to:

  * copy to floppies or any removable media. 
  * distribute over the Internet, networks or through email (forget attached file size restrictions imposed by some ISPA's and email servers). 
  * share with friends, colleagues or other users through networks and the Internet. 
  * archive to Zip disk, CD, DVD, USB Flash drive and key, and any other storage support. 
  * upload to host accounts, file delivery services... that have restrictions on file sizes. 

**Features:**

  * Create two types of pieces: disk spanned and blocked (specific size). You can enter the size for each piece file or the number of pieces you want to obtain. 
  * Generate small full-featured Self-Uniting programs to restore your split files professionally. They provide your users with an intuitive Windows interface whose appearance can be customized according to your needs. GSplit is then not required in order to restore the split file. 
  * Store file properties and restore them: fileA's date, attributes are not lost contrary to batch files. 
  * Perform fast checks to detect file corruption (size, offset, CRC32) and to give you the assurance that your files are successfully restored by your users. When a piece is corrupted, you are notified about it, so you just need to get a new copy of that piece, not the whole set. 
  * Split very large files (normally bigger than 4 GB). 
  * Customize piece files according to your needs (size, filenames, title, author...), leave additional space on disks, create pieces without headers (useful for text-based files like large server log files). 
  * Support splitting multiple files in one time, include batch (automating) and command line options. 
  * Show you elapsed and estimated times during the splitting & uniting operations. You can also pause/resume the splitting operation. 
  * Store settings into profiles and let you use these settings for different files, remember MRU files and folders, automatically try to find out the best splitting settings... 
  * Integrate Windows Explorer to let you split your files directly from the context menu. 

**Minimum requirements for GSplit:**

  * Microsoft Windows 95 OS2, 98, ME, 2000, XP, 2003 Server, Vista or higher. 
  * Intel Pentium 233 MHz (Recommended: Pentium 500MHz or greater). 
  * 128 MB RAM (Recommended: 256 MB RAM or greater). 
  * For Windows 95 users: you must have the COMCTL32.DLL update version 4.72 or higher, Microsoft Tahoma and Verdana fonts, Microsoft HTML Help. 

**What's New in version 3.0.1:**

  * Fixed: splitting by count of lines did not always work fine if the internal memory buffer size was superior to 64kb. 
  * Default size of the internal memory buffer now set to 64kb. 
  * Fixed input problem in some fields (the value resets to '0' when the field is empty). 
  * The filename of the piece currently being processed is now displayed. 
  * Fixed: GUnite.exe prompts for an incorrect file name when uniting a file split with custom filename mask. 
  * Updated memory manager and skin engine. 
  * New Check For Updates feature in Help menu. 
  * Minor improvements and bug fixes. 
  * Updated help file with a FAQ and troubleshooting section.
