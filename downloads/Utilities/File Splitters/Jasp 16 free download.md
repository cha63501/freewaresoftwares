**Publisher's Description**  
  

JASP is an File Spliting Utility. You can use this utility to Split Large
files into smaller parts and then merge them together when required. This
utility produces a .bat file which when you double click all the seperate
files will be merged into the original file.

When Merging you do not require the utility to be installed in the target
machine. This Utility comes in very handy when you have to either copy a large
file from one system to another or when you want to email a very large file,
which you cannot do at a single go beacuse of size limit.
