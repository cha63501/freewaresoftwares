**Publisher's Description**  
  

Memtest86 is thorough, stand alone memory test for x86 architecture computers.
BIOS based memory tests are a quick, cursory check and often miss many of the
failures that are detected by Memtest86.

Memtest86 was developed by Chris Brady with a first release in 1994. However,
the testing algorithms used have been under development since 1981 and have
been previously implemented on Dec PDP-11, VAX-11/780 and Cray XMP
architectures. Development and distribution of Memtest86 is now funded and
supported by BradyTech Inc.

Memtest86 is released under the terms of the Gnu Public License (GPL).

**Windows Installation**

For windows installation begin by downloading either the Pre-Compiled Windows
package to build a boot-able floppy disk or an ISO (zip version) to create a
boot-able CD-ROM. After the file is downloaded an extract must be done to
uncompress the file(s). To extract right click on the downloaded file and
select the "Extract All" option. The extract option will let you choose where
the files will be extracted to. To build a bootable floppy go the the folder
where the files were extracted and click on the Install icon. The floppy disk
will appear to be unformatted by Windows after the install is complete.

To build a boot-able CD-ROM use your CD burning software to create an image
from the un-zipped ISO file.

Note: Since Memtest86 is a standalone program it does not require any
operating system support for execution. It can be used with any PC regardless
of what operating system, if any, is installed. The test image may be loaded
from a floppy disk or may be loaded via LILO on Linux systems. Any Unix,
Windows or DOS system may be used to create a boot floppy or bootable CD-ROM.

Beginning with version 4.1.0 all images (CD, USB and Floppy Disk) use ISO-
Linux/Syslinux for booting providing a number of boot time options and the
three latest versions (currently 3.5b, 4.0b and 4.1.0) of Memtest86.
