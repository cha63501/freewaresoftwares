**Publisher's Description**  
  

SpeedFan monitors fan speeds, temperatures and voltages in computers with
hardware monitor chips. It can even access S.M.A.R.T. info for those hard
disks that support this feature and show hard disk temperatures too, if
supported. It can even change the FSB on some hardware. At the lowest level,
it is a hardware monitor software, but its main feature is that it can control
fan speeds according to the temperatures inside your pc, thus reducing noise
and power consumption.

**WhatA's New in version 4.49:**

  * fixed a typo that caused ACPI temperatures to be reported wrongly on some Windows 7 
  * changed the name of the installer to improve compatibility with Windows 8
