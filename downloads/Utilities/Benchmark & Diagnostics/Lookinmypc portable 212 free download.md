**Publisher's Description**  
  

LookInMyPC is an invaluable tool for troubleshooting problems and seeing what
is actually going on inside your computer.

LookInMyPC generates a complete, comprehensive system profile that includes
information on all installed hardware and software. Additionally it provides
system diagnostic information such as details on running processes, installed
services, startup programs, Windows updates and hot fixes, active network and
Internet connections, TCP/IP port usage, event log detail, and much more.

All this is provided in an easy to read, formatted report that you can view
and print using your web browser. We have also hyperlinked many items so you
can quickly and easily "Google" them to find out what they are or if some
programs might be spyware or viruses. It is also completely non-invasive and
makes no changes to your computers settings whatsoever.

We have even included a handy function that allows you to create a full system
profile and diagnostic report and automatically send it as an email ZIP file
attachment to a tech support or help desk person.
