**Publisher's Description**  
  


WhoCrashed is a comprehensible crash dump analysis tool. 

Whenever a computer running Windows suddenly reboots without displaying any notice or blue screen of death, the first thing that is often though about is a hardware failure. In reality, most crashes are caused by malfunctioning device drivers and kernel modules. In case of a kernel error, most computers running Windows do not show a blue screen unless they are configured to do so. Instead these systems suddenly reboot without any notice.

WhoCrashed shows the drivers which have been crashing computer with a single click. In most cases it can pinpoint the offending drivers which have been causing misery on your computer system in the past. It does post-mortem crashdump analysis and presents all gathered information in a comprehensible way.

Normally, debugging skills and a set of debugging tools are required to do post-mortem crash dump analysis. By using this utility you do not need any debugging skills to be able to find out what drivers are causing trouble to your computer.

**Note:** No longer requires download and installation of WinDbg package unless running on Windows XP or older.

WhoCrashed no longer needs to download and install the WinDbg debugger package from Microsoft. Only if you are still running Windows XP or Windows 2000 this is still required. For all later operating system versions (Windows Vista, Windows 7, etc) it will run without requiring you to download and install additional software packages. This saves installation time.
