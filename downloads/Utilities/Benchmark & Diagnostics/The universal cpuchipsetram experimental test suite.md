**Publisher's Description**  
  


RightMark Memory Analyzer aims the detailed, stable and accurate measurements of the most important low-level characteristics of the CPU/Chipset/RAM subsystem of your PC. 

Seven types of tests are implemented in the current release of the RightMark Memory Analyzer suite, that allow you to determine the following low-level parameters of the platform:

  * Average and peak memory bandwidth; 
  * Average and minimal L1/L2 data cache/memory latency; 
  * L1/L2 data cache associativity; 
  * L1-L2 data cache bus bandwidth; 
  * D-TLB size and associativity (of each level); 
  * L1 instructions cache size (including the "effective" size) and associativity; 
  * Decode efficiency of various simple x86 (ALU/FPU/MMX) instructions; 
  * I-TLB size and associativity (of each level). 

**What's New in version 3.8:**

  * RightMark Memory Stability Test (RMMS) component updated to version 1.2: Improved memory allocation scheme allowing testing up to 2000MB of memory at once, if available; added log file time stamp. 
  * RightMark Multi-Threaded Memory Test (RMMT) component updated to version 1.1: Added individual threads selection to the "All Threads" group, improved "Lock Virtual Memory Pages" feature behavior. 
  * Added EPP/XMP info to the RMMA System Info report. 
  * Added support for DDR3 SPD and Intel XMP (eXtreme Memory Profiles) SPD extension. 
  * Added limited support for Intel 3 series chipsets (Memory SPD reading). 
  * Added identification of several AMD Athlon 64 X2 NPT (revision F) CPU cores. 
  * Added identification of new Intel Core 2 CPUs, including 45nm cores. 
  * New CPU Database entries.
