**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Debug Diagnostic Tool (DebugDiag) is designed to assist in troubleshooting
issues such as hangs, slow performance, memory leaks or fragmentation, and
crashes in any Win32 user-mode process. The tool includes additional debugging
scripts focused on Internet Information Services (IIS) applications, web data
access components, COM+ and related Microsoft technologies.

DebugDiag was released as part of the IIS Diagnostic toolkit and as a
standalone tool. DebugDiag 1.1 is currently available as a standalone tool.

DebugDiag provides an extensible object model in the form of COM objects and
provides a script host with a built-in reporting framework.

It is composed of the following 3 components; a debugging service, a debugger
host, and the user interface.

**The Debugging Service**  
The debugger service (DbgSvc.exe) performs the following tasks:

  * Attach/Detach the host to processes 
  * Collect performance monitor data 
  * Implement HTTP ping to detect hangs 
  * Inject leak monitor in running processes 
  * Collect debugging session state information 
  * Shows the state of each rule defined 

**The Debugger Host**  
The Debugger Host (DbgHost.exe) hosts the Windows Symbolic Debugger Engine
(dbgeng.dll) to attach to processes and generate memory dumps. It also hosts
the main analyzer module to analyze memory dumps. Dbghost.exe has no
dependency on the service ADbgSvc.exeA and can be used separately.

**The User Interface**  
The user interfaces (DebugDiag.exe and DebugDiagAnalysisOnly.exe) present an
interface to analyze memory dumps, automate the creation of control scripts
and show the status of running processes, including services.

**It is composed of 3 views:**

  * Rules: Creates control script for the debugger host through a wizard. The script is located under \scripts 
  * Advanced Analysis: Runs a selected AAnalysis ScriptA against one or more memory dumps. 
  * Processes: Shows status of running processes/services 
Note: DebugDiagAnalysisOnly.exe does not require elevation on operating
systems beginning with Vista, so it only contains the Advanced Analysis view.
