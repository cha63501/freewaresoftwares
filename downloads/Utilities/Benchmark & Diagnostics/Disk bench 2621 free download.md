**Publisher's Description**  
  

How fast are my disks really? Disk Bench will test your hard drive speed in a
real life situation not in a benchmarking environment.

All it does is copies a file from A to B, times the time it took, and deletes
the file from B again.

The other way to benchmark is to choose Create File. This way it just creates
a file (consisting of a repeated 128 byte string). So if you only have one
harddisk, this is the optimal test for you.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html).

**WhatA's New in version 2.6.2.1:**
