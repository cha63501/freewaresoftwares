**Publisher's Description**  
  

This test allows you to completely test your video RAM (accessible to
DirectX). The best way to check stability after overclocking.

The archive contains a README file, which must by read before use of program.

  * DirectX 7.0 or better must be installed (DirectX 9 is recommended). 
  * Before testing, all graphical applications (editors, viewers, players, games etc.) must be closed. 
  * Monitor standby function must be deactivated. 
  * Before the program starts testing, it prompts for changing video mode to 640x480x16 (to be able to capture more video RAM), and it is recommended to agree. Your actual video mode will be restored after the test ending (or canceling).
