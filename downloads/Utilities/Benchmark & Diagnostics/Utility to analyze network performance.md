**Publisher's Description**  
  


Net Runner is an accurate and fast performing analyzer for testing the performance of a network. It does this by communicating with its counterpart, Net Node. Firstly you install Net Node on other computers within the network. Net Node will then act as a server for Net Runner. You then instruct Net Runner to connect to a certain node and it will start testing. Depending on the options you chose, Net Runner will continue to test the performance of the network until all tests have been completed. The end result illustrates a speed vs. time graph.
