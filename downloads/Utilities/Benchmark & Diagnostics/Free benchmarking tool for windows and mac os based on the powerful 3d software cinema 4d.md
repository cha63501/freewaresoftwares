**Publisher's Description**  
  


CINEBENCH is the free benchmarking tool for Windows and Mac OS based on the powerful 3D software CINEMA 4D. Consequently, the results of tests conducted using CINEBENCH carry significant weight when analyzing a computerAs performance in everyday use. Especially a systemAs CPU and the OpenGL capabilities of its graphics card are put through their paces (even multiprocessor systems with up to 16 dedicated CPUs or processor cores). During the testing procedure, all relevant data is ascertained with which the performance of different computers can subsequently be compared, regardless of operating system. 

CINEBENCH includes render tasks that test the performance of up to 16 multiprocessors on the same computer as well as software-only shading tests and OpenGL shading tests on huge numbers of animated polygons that will push any computer to its limits.

CINEBENCH is available for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems and as a AUniversal BinaryA version for Apple Macintosh computers with PowerPC or Intel Core Duo processors. The database functionality and simple export allow for easy statistical data collection. CINEBENCH is used extensively by leading trade journals and hardware manufacturers such as Intel, AMD and Apple to compare computer performance.
