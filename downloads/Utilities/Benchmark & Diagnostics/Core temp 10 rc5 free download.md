**Publisher's Description**  
  

Core Temp is a compact, no fuss, small footprint program to monitor CPU
temperature.

The uniqueness of it is that it shows the temperature of each individual core
in a each processor in your system! You can see in real time how the CPU
temperature varies when you load your CPU.

Intel and AMD recently published detailed, public information about the "DTS"
(Digital Thermal Sensor), which provides much higher accuracy and more
relevant temperature reading than the standard thermal diode sensors do. (How
it works).

This feature is supported on all Intel Core and Core 2 series of processors as
well as the whole AMDA's AMD64 line of CPUs. (for a full list of supported
CPUs: (CPU Support List).

Core Temp also has a logging feature, allowing a user to easily record the
temperature of his processor(s) over any period of time, then the data can be
easily transfered into an excel datasheet for easy graphing.

**What's New in version 1.0 RC5:**

  * New: Multilingual interface. Core Temp now natively supports adding non-English languages. 
  * New: Plugin system - 3rd party developers can now create plugins and extensions for Core Temp, both native code and .Net is supported, please see this for more information. 
  * New: Added support for Intel Pentium and AMD K5 and newer processors. (detection only) 
  * New: Added support for VIA processors. (C3 - detection only, Temperature) 
  * New: Intel Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, AMD Bulldozer, Piledriver and Fusion (Trinity, Llano, Brazos) support. 
  * New: Max TDP detection on supporting processors. 
  * New: Active power consumption on Intel's Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors. 
  * Fix: All of the user reported bugs and many more unreported problems. 
  * Update: Optimized the startup code, Core Temp should now launch 2 to 4 times faster. 
  * Update: Optimized many other aspects of the code, Core Temp should now consume much less CPU time than before. 
  * Update: Restored support for older OS: Windows XP is now fully supported, Windows 2000 requires security updates KB935839, KB835732 and GDI+. In some cases hotfix KB816542 may be needed as well.
