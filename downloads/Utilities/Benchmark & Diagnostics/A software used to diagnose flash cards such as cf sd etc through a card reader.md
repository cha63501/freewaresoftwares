**Publisher's Description**  
  


CardTest is a software used to diagnose flash cards such as CF, SD, etc through a card reader. 

CardTest is able to detect defect sectors of a flash card (CF, SD, MMC cards, etc.). CardTest detects potential defect sectors by accessing every sector on the flash memory card. CardTest supports several pattern tests besides filling the flash memory with 0 or 1, it aims to detects whether the flash memory is stable or not.

NOTE: Currently, CardTest supports no larger than 2GB flash card. CardTest may not detect the defect sectors repeatedly due to the internal management of defect sectors of certern flash media.
