**Publisher's Description**  
  

Heavyload is intended to stress all resources of a PC (like CPU, RAM,
harddisk, network, operating system, etc.) in order to test, if it will run
reliable under heavy load. This is useful for testing important NT file or
database servers before using them productively, or just to check if your new
PC might get too hot when used intensively.

To stress your PC or server, HeavyLoad writes a large test-file to the temp
folder, it allocates physical and virtual memory and it draws patterns in its
window.
