**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Microsoft DynamicsA CRM 3.0 Performance and Stress Testing Toolkit is a
tool that was created by the MicrosoftA(r) CRM product team to formalize
performance testing of Microsoft CRM 3.0. This toolkit facilitates load
testing for particular customer scenarios. Taking the time to carefully
consider and gather dataset and workload requirements, together with accurate
modeling of those requirements may prevent added expense if a performance or
scalability design is discovered late in the implementation process. This
document, together with the code and examples in the toolkit, are designed to
provide a solid foundation for running robust and meaningful performance
tests.
