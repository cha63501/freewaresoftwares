**Publisher's Description**  
  


With Speed Test you can monitor CPU (over 8 cores) and RAM usage by itself and it has the ability to test: 

  * Maximum bandwidth speed (Internet Speed Test) 
  * Your own website download speed, response time and errors 
  * Hard drive space and activity 
  * Ping response times 
  * WIFI Signal strength 
  * Battery Charge status 
  * LAN bandwidth 
  * Upload and download data transfers 
  * Single process memory usage 
  * and so much more 
You can view all this information in a graph, allowing you to see the results even after they happened. Imagine something on your computer slowing down and by the time you look at any other utility, the problem has vanished, but not with Speed Test and its graph. 

Speed Test also has cross-hairs that allow you to put your cursor over the line you are inquiring about and detailed information is shown with the time and value of that point on the graph.

Comes with 19 Skins and 73 Backgrounds. Very easy and intuitive interface.
