**Publisher's Description**  
  


IntelBurnTest - Tool that helps Intel(R) Core 2(tm)-based (or others) test for system stability in a relatively short time (greatly shorter than Prime95). 

The program utilizes Intel(R)A's very own CPU stress testing binaries for the most stressful, and speedy testing. This software will put even the highest end Intel(R) Core 2(tm) Extreme rigs to their knees, and shows how REALLY stable the system is. 

It is highly recommended to use a 64-bit Windows operating system (XP x64 preferred) for the most accurate testing and using maximum amount of free system memory. It will work on even Intel(R) Pentium III processors, but unfortunately, Intel(R) designed the binaries in a way that makes it not run at all on any AMD CPUs. Donations are appreciated!

**Caution:** Not for beginning overclockers. This program **WILL** stress the CPU, Memory, North Bridge, and other system components to their highest extent! Make sure your PC is properly cooled and ventilated!

**WhatA's New in version 2.54:**

  * Linpack binaries updated (7-20-2012) + patched for AMD CPUs 
  * Improved effectiveness of Xtreme Stress Mode
