**Publisher's Description**  
  

The purpose of this utility is to detect the optical driveA's (CD / DVD
drives) Read/Write capabilities. When looking at the front of a computer which
is not your own it is often difficult to tell whether the optical drive
installed is either a CD ROM, CD Writer, CD Rewriter, DVD ROM, CD Rewriter +
DVD Combo, DVD/CD Rewriter etc.

A utility like this is useful because CD and DVD drives donA't often display
their capabilities in the front and sometimes even if they do, they still
canA't been seen due to the design of the PCA's case.

People quite often have more than one optical drive installed in their
machine. They can have for example the original CD ROM or Writer drive and
also a newer DVD drive. Another advange of this utility is allows you to see
by selecting the drive letter for one of the drives, which is which. It also
allows you to see which of the two or more drives is the faster for reading /
writing.
