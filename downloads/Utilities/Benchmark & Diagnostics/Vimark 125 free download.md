**Publisher's Description**  
  

ViMark is the relevant PC benchmark for most users. Other benchmark may
measure the system speed, but you are unlikely to see the difference. After
all, your typing and mouse clicking wonA't become faster on the latest PC.
ViMark measures the only lengthy process most people do on the computer -
video encoding. You convert video to upload to your portable devices, whether
thatA's a iPod, phone, or Zune and you burn home DVDA's. Those tasks may take
hours to complete, and ViMark measures that.

ViMark is easy. It does require QuickTime and DirectX. Other than those two
standard video related system components, there is no extra codec download.
Run ViMark and you will get your result in minutes. ViMark is a uniformed
benchmark. Want to compare your result with other people? Submit to ViMark
website and you can easily compare to results running the same CPU or same OS.

ViMark helps you to tune your performance. If you see your own result is
substantially lower than others who use the same CPU and OS, you know there is
a problem. Discuss with others in our discussion forum. It helps you to tune
your system for the best performance.

It is a free software and free service. Download, install, run and compare.
