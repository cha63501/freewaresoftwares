**Publisher's Description**  
  


Lamark is an updated remake of the popular 80s and 90s benchmarking tool Landmark Speed Test by Landmark Research International Corporation. 

When launched, it starts performing a continuous series of speed tests, including CPU, FPU and Memory. Results are normalized according to an Athlon XP 2400+ where CPU and FPU run at 2000 Mhz, and memory has a bandwidth of 266 Mhz.

Values shown, represent the processing power while dealing with CPU operations (integer calculations), FPU operations (floating point calculations), and Memory (memory reads) extrapolated to all system cores/processors in raw synthetic 32 bit execution. 

**Quick Facts:**

  * Blazing fast program execution. 
  * Very low resource usage while testing. 
  * Small footprint, can be run from floppy disks, USB devices, hard disks, ... 
  * Quick startup time. 

**Key Features:**

  * CPU speed test. 
  * FPU speed test. 
  * Memory bandwidth test. 

**What's New in version 0.95.165:**

  * Added GDI performance test; 
  * Added disk performance test writting using memory mapped access if available to a file in order to assure maximum performance; 
  * Assembly loops are now aligned in a paragraph instead of in a double word boundary, making CPU, FPU and memory benchmarks more precise; 
  * Enhanced progress bars to be animated on the first time.
