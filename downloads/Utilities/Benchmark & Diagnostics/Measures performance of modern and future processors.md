**Publisher's Description**  
  


The CPU RightMark suite is meant for objective measurement of performance of modern and future processors in different computational tasks such as numerical modeling of physical processes and solving of 3D graphic problems. It focuses on testing the loaded FPU/SIMD units and the CPU/RAM tandem. 

As a result, we get pure CPU performance, an objective parameter obtained without the influence of other subsystems, like video and disc systems, except the memory one. CPU RightMark allows users to compare the true performance of different processors irrespective of a type of other system components. ItA's obtained by dealing only with the CPU and measuring the CPU time spent for execution of computational tasks.
