**Publisher's Description**  
  

NBenchmark is a framework and a tool to create benchmarks to measure Hardware
and Software performance, identify system bottlenecks, optimize code, automate
performance testing. Designed for .NET Full and Compact Frameworks.

**Features:**

  * Gets _measurable_ results of performance testing (numbers you can analyze and compare) 
  * Makes performance tests _reproducable_ (repeat tests in different environments by different people at a different time) 
  * Tests specific narrow scenarios we well as realistic combinations of such scenarios 
  * Measures impact of the environment (HW and SW) to the results of the tests 
  * Provides a set of standard tests for HW and OS to investigate system bottlenecks, certify HW 
  * Generates reports to quickly communicate the results and keep for historical records 
  * Supports majority of Windows operating systems: Windows XP, Vista, 2003, Windows Mobile 5.0+, CE 6.0+. Makes the results of tests on different platforms _comparable_ 
  * Provides framework to implement application-level benchmarks 
  * Integrates benchmarking into continuous building process and regression testing 
  * Integrates into Visual Studio to benchmark applications and perform profiling 

Supports Windows 2003, 2008, XP, Vista, Mobile 5.0+, CE 5.0+.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).

**WhatA's New in version 1.0.0:**

  * Benchmarking framework for implementing application-level benchmarks 
  * Customizable test frequencies within test suites for representing various realistic scenarios 
  * Test configurations, customizable by the user running the tests 
  * Report generation containing benchmark results, configurations and enviroment characteristics 
  * Standard benchmarking of hardware, including disk, cpu, video, network 
  * Graphical and console utilities for benchmark execution on full and compact .NET frameworks 
  * Support for multi-threaded and nominal benchmarking 
  * Installers Defects fixed: none
