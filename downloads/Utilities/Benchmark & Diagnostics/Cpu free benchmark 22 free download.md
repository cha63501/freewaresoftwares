**Publisher's Description**  
  

A CPU benchmarking tool that includes test involving CPUA's registries, FPU,
and ALU.

There are 3 major tests (registry, floating-point operations & integer
operations).

Each test is built based on some equations & operations depending on the test.

Every major test contains 3 identical tests. For every identical test the
seconds and milliseconds are calculated. At the end of a major test, an
arithmetic average is made from the seconds & milliseconds times saved from
those 3 tests. So if u get a wrong time at a "mini"-test the other 2 can make
the error be ignored.

The program was compiled with no optimization (speed, floating-point), so
tests cannot be in favour of a certain processor type.

**WhatA's New in version 2.2:**

  * Name was changed. All three tests were combined in one test. Results are NOT compatible with older versions of CPU Free BenchMark. The score is made in seconds with two decimal precision!
