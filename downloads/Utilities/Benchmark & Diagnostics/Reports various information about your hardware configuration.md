VSO-Inspector is a free add-on to report various information about your hardware configuration. 

Using this freeware, you can check the listed cd and dvd readers and writers connected to your computer, check the firmware used. The details about the media used and the speed supported by a given writer with this media. 

Also you can scan a burnt media for read errors and be confident about the readability of your fresh backup.

**Detect and list the features of your CD/DVD writers:**

  * Supported formats 
  * Region details 
  * Firmware versions 
  * Buffer size 
  * Region Code 
  * Read modes 
  * Write modes 
  * Etc 

**Detect and list information about the inserted media:**

  * Media type 
  * Capacity 
  * Media ID (manufacturer and/or model) 
  * Number of layers 
  * Supported speeds (with current writer) 

**Media Analysis:**

  * Sector reading 
  * Definition of the area to check
