**Publisher's Description**  
  


Despite the name, XPBench is not really designed to be a skinning benchmark program (we suggest checking out programs like SkinBench for that). 

XPBench is rather specifically designed to query which Windows XP features are supported by a video card/driver combination and then demonstrate the performance improvements supporting the XP APIA's makes.

At this time, XPBench checks for the following:

  * Does the driver support constant alpha blending (this improves the performance of fade effects as an example) 
  * Does the driver support per pixel alpha blending (window shadows make use of this)
