**Publisher's Description**  
  


winLogAnalyzer is a program that allows to detect anomalies in Windows, user processes and hardware behavior which can appear because of attacks, viruses activity, software & hardware failures and other potentially dangerous states of computer by performance counters data real-time analysis implemented by specific data mining algorithms. 

Anomalies in Windows subsystems (such as virtual memory, file systems, net connections), hardware (such as processor, hard disk, Ethernet card) and user processes are detected as deviations from normal behavior templates discovered by program and not explicitly allowed by user. Detecting is based on Windows performance counters data analysis. You should know that not all negative situations lead to deviations which can be successfully detected through this analysis. Nevertheless this method allows to detect unlimited range of dangerous and potentially dangerous states, failures and actions in the work of software and hardware. 

**Features:**

  * Variety of analyzing plug-ins: you can use the most appropriate one for each log. 
  * Expansibility of analysis methods: to improve analysis you can get new official and third-party plug-ins or develop your own. 
  * Powerful notification abilities: you can filter messages by content, warning level, source, etc. and define notification conditions for each method: email, net send, special program executing. 
  * Customizable monitoring: you can monitor Windows subsystems, applications and hardware that you need with consumption of system resources that you want.
