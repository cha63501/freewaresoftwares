**Publisher's Description**  
  

CardTest is a software used to diagnose flash cards such as CF, SD, etc
through a card reader.

CardTest is able to detect defect sectors of a flash card (CF, SD, MMC cards,
etc.). CardTest detects potential defect sectors by accessing every sector on
the flash memory card. CardTest supports several pattern tests besides filling
the flash memory with 0 or 1, it aims to detects whether the flash memory is
stable or not.

NOTE: Currently, CardTest supports no larger than 2GB flash card. CardTest may
not detect the defect sectors repeatedly due to the internal management of
defect sectors of certern flash media.
