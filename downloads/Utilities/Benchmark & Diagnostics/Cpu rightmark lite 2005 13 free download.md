**Publisher's Description**  
  

The CPU RightMark suite is meant for objective measurement of performance of
modern and future processors in different computational tasks such as
numerical modeling of physical processes and solving of 3D graphic problems.
It focuses on testing the loaded FPU/SIMD units and the CPU/RAM tandem.

As a result, we get pure CPU performance, an objective parameter obtained
without the influence of other subsystems, like video and disc systems, except
the memory one. CPU RightMark allows users to compare the true performance of
different processors irrespective of a type of other system components. ItA's
obtained by dealing only with the CPU and measuring the CPU time spent for
execution of computational tasks.
