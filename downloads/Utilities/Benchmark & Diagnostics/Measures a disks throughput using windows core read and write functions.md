**Publisher's Description**  
  


DiskTT measures a diskA's thruput under 32/64-bit windows using Windows core read and write functions. Your actual disk performance under Windows is determined not only by the speed of your harddrive (as measured by most disk benchmarks) but also by factors such as the mainboard chipset, UDMA/PIO mode, RAID configuration, CPU speed, RAM size and the quality of drivers. 

DiskTT simply tries to give you an indication of the amount of Megabytes per second read and write speed you get under your normal Windows environment. DiskTT is freeware.
