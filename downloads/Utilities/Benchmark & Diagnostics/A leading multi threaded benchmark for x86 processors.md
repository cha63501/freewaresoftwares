**Publisher's Description**  
  


wPrime is a leading multi-threaded benchmark for x86 processors that tests your processor performance by calculating square roots with a recursive call of NewtonA's method for estimating functions, with f(x)=x2-k, where k is the number weA're sqrting, until Sgn(f(x)/fA'(x)) does not equal that of the previous iteration, starting with an estimation of k/2. 

It then uses an iterative calling of the estimation method a set amount of times to increase the accuracy of the results. It then confirms that n(k)2=k to ensure the calculation was correct. It repeats this for all numbers from 1 to the requested maximum. 

**Note:** Please run in compatibility mode in 64 bit OS and as Administrator on Windows Vista or 7. 

**WhatA's New in version 2.09:**

  * Updates CPUz to 1.60 for the latest hardware detection
