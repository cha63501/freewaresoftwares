**Publisher's Description**  
  

A simulation of real world file transfer performance. Generates files and then
transfers them using the Windows Shell or Finder in OS X. Outputs performance
results to .csv and has an optional plotting feature.

**WhatA's New in version 3.2.0:**

  * External script mode now supports absolute paths for logfiles. 
  * External script mode now supports running presets. Use the command "preset " where the available presets are "slow", "medium", "fast", and "onegig". You do not need to issue a plot command to generate the medians in this mode. 
  * Fixed Applescript timeout issue that affected large file transfers in OS X. 
  * Partially fixed the plot command in external script mode. It will generate the medians for the last test run. It will not generate plots, though. 
  * Improved error handling during file transfers. If Copymark detects that the drive has fallen off the bus, it will issue a warning.
