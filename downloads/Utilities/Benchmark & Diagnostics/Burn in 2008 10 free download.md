**Publisher's Description**  
  

Burn In 2008 is a windows based utility that uses cutting edged algorithms to
test the stability of your processor. With two settings you can not only make
sure your overclocked processor is computing the correct values, but you can
also do a burn in to ensure you have enough cooling capabilities.

Unofficial tests have shown that Burn In 2008 produces more heat in the CPU
Burn In mode than the leading Burn In programs. Along with pushing your CPU to
its maximum Burn In 2008 also is built to work with all processors, 32-bit and
64-bit, and can put even dual quad cores to their maximum usage and heat
production.
