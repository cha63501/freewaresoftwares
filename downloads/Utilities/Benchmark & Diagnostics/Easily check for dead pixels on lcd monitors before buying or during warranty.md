**Publisher's Description**  
  


InjuredPixels allows you to easily check for defective (hot, dead or stuck) pixels on LCD monitors. InjuredPixels can be used to test a new LCD monitor before purchasing, or an already purchased monitor during the warranty period (as you may get a replacement according to the manufacturerA's dead pixel policy). 

InjuredPixels fills the entire screen with a primary or custom color, allowing you to inspect the screen for pixels that do not match the selected color. The program is easy to use: click or use the arrow keys to cycle through colors or right-click to get the menu with the main commands.

InjuredPixels can be run directly without having to install it on your computer: just download and run.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) or above.
