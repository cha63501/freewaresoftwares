**Publisher's Description**  
  


How fast are my disks really? Disk Bench will test your hard drive speed in a real life situation not in a benchmarking environment. 

All it does is copies a file from A to B, times the time it took, and deletes the file from B again.

The other way to benchmark is to choose Create File. This way it just creates a file (consisting of a repeated 128 byte string). So if you only have one harddisk, this is the optimal test for you. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html). 

**WhatA's New in version 2.6.2.1:**

  * Minor change to work better on larger text sizes
