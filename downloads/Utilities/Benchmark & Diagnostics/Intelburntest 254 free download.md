**Publisher's Description**  
  

IntelBurnTest - Tool that helps Intel(R) Core 2(tm)-based (or others) test for
system stability in a relatively short time (greatly shorter than Prime95).

The program utilizes Intel(R)A's very own CPU stress testing binaries for the
most stressful, and speedy testing. This software will put even the highest
end Intel(R) Core 2(tm) Extreme rigs to their knees, and shows how REALLY
stable the system is.

It is highly recommended to use a 64-bit Windows operating system (XP x64
preferred) for the most accurate testing and using maximum amount of free
system memory. It will work on even Intel(R) Pentium III processors, but
unfortunately, Intel(R) designed the binaries in a way that makes it not run
at all on any AMD CPUs. Donations are appreciated!

**Caution:** Not for beginning overclockers. This program **WILL** stress the CPU, Memory, North Bridge, and other system components to their highest extent! Make sure your PC is properly cooled and ventilated!

**WhatA's New in version 2.54:**

  * Linpack binaries updated (7-20-2012) + patched for AMD CPUs 
  * Improved effectiveness of Xtreme Stress Mode
