**Publisher's Description**  
  

V-Grep is an easy to use while feature-rich application that brings - well
known in the Unix world - regular expressions power to the typical Windows
users.

Even in DOS you could use masks, to speed-up searching for files. These masks
were later adopted for use in Windows. Masks are special types of strings that
with the help of reserved characters - here it would be an asterik and
question mark - allow you to easily describe complex patterns.

Sounds complicated ? But it isnA't - very simple expression A'*.txtA'
describes every string that ends with A'.txtA' phrase. Regular expressions are
using basic concept of the masks but they add even more special characters
that can represent definite number of characters, optional phrases etc.

You can specify expressions representing complex patterns that are difficult
or impossible to find using only masks, such as: e-mail addresses, telephone
numbers, IP addresses etc. In the Unix-class systems regular expressions are
handled by a program called GREP (Global Regular Expression Print).

V-Grep (Visual GREP) gives you whole functionality of GREP and lots of other
very useful options - all packed in a typical Windows GUI. V-Grep allows you
also to search for files even without any knowledge about regular expression,
but even then itA's much better way to do this than by using Windows built-in
search feature, mainly because of a more legible search results.
