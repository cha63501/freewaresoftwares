**Publisher's Description**  
  

BanishCD will stop Windows from searching for CAB files on the CD.

One of the best ways to make Windows more convenient is to copy the CAB files
from the CD onto your harddrive, so whenever you install any new hardware, you
donA't need to put the CD in your system. Unfortunately, Windows still ASKS
for the CD, and you need to point it to where you copied the CAB files to,
until now...

AnalogX BanishCD is a small utility that allows you to change the path that
Windows will look for the CAB files. Normally, the only way this could be done
would be to modify the registry manually, which is a very tricky process, and
if you make a mistake it can be hard to repair. With BanishCD, you can quickly
browse through your system and select the path; and just in case you make a
mistake it will store the original path!
