**Publisher's Description**  
  

Disktective is a disk reporting tool that allows you to visualize your hard
disk usage with pie charts, allowing you to quickly spot which directories use
up the most space. You can navigate the directory tree and get a pie chart for
each selected item, which can also be printed (in full color) or exported to
HTML (text based) or proprietary tree format.

The program is simple to use and does not require installation - just run the
executable.
