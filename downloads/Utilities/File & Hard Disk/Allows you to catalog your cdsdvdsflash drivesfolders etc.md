If you are tired of putting in dozens of CDs/DVDs or any other media every time you need to find a file, or if youA're just not happy with the speed and capabilities of Windows file search for searching local files, CD Sync is for you. 

CD Sync allows you to catalog your CDs/DVDs/Flash Drives/Folders etc. With CD Sync, you get the ability to browse and search (even in multiple discs at once) your data, even when the source media is not available. Just image all your discs and you will notice how easy it is to find the file you want.
