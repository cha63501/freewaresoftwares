**Publisher's Description**  
  

Do your programs use large temporary files on hard disk? Do you need to be
warned when space has expired? FreeSpace monitors and tells you in real time
how much free space is available on your hard disk. An attractive interface
shows your total and free space for each drive as well as the cumulative
totals. You can set alarms to keep you informed when minimum free space
threshold levels have been reached.

FreeSpace also allows you to conduct performance tests for your hard drives,
and displays the results in an good-looking 3D graph.

You can also retrieve detailed information about the contents of drives and
folders. After a quick scan, total, system, hidden, and read-only numbers of
files and folders are returned, as well as the disk space they consume.

printing files of unpredictable size, and it is especially designed for
workstations graphics.
