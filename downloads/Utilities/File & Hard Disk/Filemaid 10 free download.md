If youA're the administrator of a network with 500+ users chances are your
file servers are holding several million files. ThereA's also a good chance
that youA're more than suspicious that a large amount of the data are no
longer in use. With FileMaid you can examine any size file server to see what
data is not being used and simply delete it. FileMaid is designed with an
appealing, intuitive graphical user interface to allow easy detection and
selection of unused data. FileMaid will allow you to browse files in an
Explorer-like interface, selecting files and folders for deletion.
Multithreading is used for performance and responsiveness and extensive error
handling makes FileMaid a very robust application.
