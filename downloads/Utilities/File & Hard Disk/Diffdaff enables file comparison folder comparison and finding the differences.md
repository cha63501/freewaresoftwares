**Publisher's Description**  
  


DiffDaff enables easy comparison of files, folder comparison and the detection of differences between two web pages. The variations are classified as changes, deleted, non existing, and identical content. The variations are also color marked. The source code is accessible and parallel scrolling through the results is possible. Numerous options facilitate the work and simplify the location of differences. 

Additionally, the results can be numbered line by line or the line-breaks can be eliminated. DiffDaff is suitable for searches involving version differences, differences between websites, debugging source code, help with the version administration, comparison of backups, folder relations and much more. A learning curve is not necessary since the software and the results are self explanatory.
