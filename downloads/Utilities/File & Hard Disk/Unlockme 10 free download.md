**Publisher's Description**  
  

UnlockMe enables you to delete, move or rename files or folders that are
temporarily locked by other processes.

UnlockMe was designed to be a useful Windows Explorer extension allowing users
with a simple right click on a file or folder to easily get rid of error
messages and end the process locking the item. If you ever tried to work with
a file and get one of these annoying messages:

  * Cannot delete file: Access is denied. 
  * There has been a sharing violation. 
  * The source or destination file may be in use. 
  * The file is in use by another program or user. 
  * Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use. 
UnlockMe is the solution! It integrates into the Windows right-click menu
which unlocks the file with one click. Simply right click the folder or file
and select UnlockMe. The folder or file will be unlocked.
