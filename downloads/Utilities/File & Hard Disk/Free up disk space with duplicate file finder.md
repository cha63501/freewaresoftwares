**Publisher's Description**  
  


Most computer users create and download different files on a daily basis. As time goes by, hard disks get packed with documents, pictures, music, videos, and other files. And then suddenly there is almost no free disk space left! But that is only partly true. 

Most people are unaware of how many duplicate files there are cluttering their hard disks. All those songs that have been downloaded twice, holiday photos uploaded multiple times, documents copied and pasted, so that you have them in two folders at once! All that wasted disk space can be reclaimed by simply deleting duplicate files.

Apart from using up hard disk space, having too many duplicate files can make your computer run slower. Deleting them will help you speed up disk defragmentation, Windows search, and anti-virus scans.

Auslogics Duplicate File Finder is a nifty free utility that will help you get rid of useless duplicates and reclaim up to 50% of free hard disk space. It will ask you for duplicate files search criteria - you can match files by name, date and time they were created, size, and even contents. Then it will do a quick but thorough search and present you with the list of duplicate files. You can review them before deleting any. That way you can avoid deleting any files that are not duplicates, but match your search criteria.

**WhatA's New in version 4.5.3.0:**

  * fixed a critical bug that could cause significant performance loss on certain systems running Windows 8.1; 
  * improved program stability; 
  * improved program launch speed.
