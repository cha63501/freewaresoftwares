**Publisher's Description**  
  

Visual CD is a disk cataloging tool to index the contents of your media
storage such as CDs, DVDs, HD-DVDs, BlueRay Discs, USB disks, hard disks,
folders and allow you to search the contents at a later date.

Visual CD can index the files from the media by name, date, ID3 tag data,
audio-video and picture information, generate thumbnail from picture and video
files, and even catalog files which are contained in Zip/Cab/Rar/7-Zip archive
files. Additionally, you can password protect catalogs in case you want to
hide sensitive filenames from prying eyes, create MP3 playlist file without
having the physical disks in the drive. Upon insertion of the corresponding
disk, you can open files, extract Zip/Cab/Rar/7-Zip archive, splitting files,
and more.

The flexibility of Visual CD allows you to move the catalogs from one folder
to another, import/export them, update the collections, renaming, and more.

Visual CD is easy to use! The Windows Explorer-like style ensures that you
will not find any difficulties to use it. Visual CD also support full Windows
visual style and user friendly interface. Just try it and love it!
