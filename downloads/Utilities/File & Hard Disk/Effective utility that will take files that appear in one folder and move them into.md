**Publisher's Description**  
  


File Mover is a simple yet effective utility that will take files that appear in one folder, and move them into another. This is useful when a program (or remote server) dumps files into a folder & you want to move them somewhere else. An added bonus with this utility is that itA'll (optionally) run a program each time a file is moved; this could be useful for firing off email notification.
