**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pathbuddy is a program that lets you define hotkeys for selecting folders in
almost any programA's Open & Save dialogs and in the file Explorer. You can
immediately change to predefined folders through hotkeys. Use the Quicklist
function instead of the hotkeys to browse your predefined folders to make a
selection.

Example applications: multimedia workstations - easy and fast access to large
media pools (works with networks too), laptops - access folders much faster
and easier than with built-in touchpads, software/html developers - fast
access to frequently used folders during developement or debugging.
