**Publisher's Description**  
  


Urfin is a tool that turns an old dream of many people into reality: to find any file located in shared directories in local area network just per a single mouse click. 

How does it work? Urfin is a Windows NT service, that periodically searches all the available in Windows LAN computers and domains and collects all found information about files in its database. Using any browser users can access Urfin as a usual Web site, enter search criteria for files they need (e.g. *.mp3, *.gif, or even using regular expressions like *notep*.exe) and get results in browser as URLA's pointing on these files.

There are two versions of Urfin available: free and advanced. The advanced version has a set of useful features. For example, using Urfin HotAgent feature, user is able to save his search criteria and get results per email periodically (e.g. search criteria "*.mp3" and "show recent for three days" will sent to user by email newest mp3 files downloaded by the other users of LAN).
