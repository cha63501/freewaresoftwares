**Publisher's Description**  
  


A Windows Utility to calculate checksums, crc16, crc32 AND md5 values for multiple files using a Windows Explorer style interface. Useful for finding duplicate files and/or files that have changed between directories. 

Please note, there are various different CRC methods, I have chosen as default the methods I believe to be the most popular, although alternatives can be configured too. See readme.txt Notes section for more detail. 

The intended audience for this utility is not the complete novice, and as such, performing certain tasks requires a couple or more tasks to be performed. In this way, the functionalty will remain, without sacrificing flexibility.

Example: Removing identical files from the list requires that you first sort the list to group identical files together (preferrably md5). Now the list is sorted, clicking flag adjacent identicals will flag all files next to each other in the list where all calculated values are the same. The flexibility in this approach is that you have the option to have sorted the list in whatever fashion before this operation.

eg1. You may have also sorted by file name so that only identical files with also the same name are flagged.

eg2. You may have flagged some files you want excluded from this operation and sorted the list by flagged first. (then removed all flagged).
