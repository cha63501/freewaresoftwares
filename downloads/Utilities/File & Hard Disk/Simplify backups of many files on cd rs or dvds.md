**Publisher's Description**  
  


The New Fileorder was created to simplify backups of many files on CD-Rs with 650 MB, 700 MB ,DVDs or any size. In the long run it is not acceptable to copy big data volumes into 650 repectively 700 MB (or more) sized folders by hand to burn them afterwards. This job is now done by The New Fileorder. 

The New Fileorder is completely realeased in Java. Therefore the Java Development Kit is needed. Download the JRE or SDK from sun.com. **[JRE / SDK Sun.com**](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html)
