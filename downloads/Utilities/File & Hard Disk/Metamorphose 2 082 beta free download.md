MA(c)tamorphose is a free, open source mass renaming program that combines
great flexability with an intuitive interface.

Allows many command line renaming operations in a single utility, perfect for
those of us that need to rename large numbers of files and/or folders on a
regular basis.

However, the ease of the interface ensures a one-time user (I need to rename 5
gigs of mp3A's) will not find it too frustrating to use.

  * Sequential numbering (enumerating) options:
