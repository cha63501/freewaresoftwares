**Publisher's Description**  
  

FileStats is a simple utility that scans a folder and its sub-folders and
returns statistics on the files found. It returns a by-extension break down of
number of files, file size and number of lines.

Counting the lines of files works for all operating systemsA' End-Of-Line
delimiters of common text files, i.e. UNIC (LF ASCII 10), DOS (CRLF ASCII
13+10) and MAC (CR ASCII 13).

FileStats will only count the number of files specified as "text" in the user
preferences, so you can define exactly which files you would like the program
to attempt opening and counting its lines.
