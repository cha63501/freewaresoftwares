**Publisher's Description**  
  

Hidecalc is a program that makes it easier to set the registry up for hiding
drives within Windows. This is useful if you need to lock down a machine to
stop users from doing damage where they shouldnA't be or saving data where
they shouldnA't be.

It is ideal for hiding drives in Terminal Server/Citrix.

Running hidecalc will not alter anything in your Registry. It is the data
files it creates that will make changes when executed.

**Features:**

  * Export to ADMX Group Policy templates for Server 2008/Vista/Windows 7. 
  * Export to ADM Group Policy Templates for Server 2000/ 2003/ 2008/ Workstations NT4/ 2000/ XP/ Vista/ Windows 7. 
  * Export for Kix Scripts. 
  * Export for Powershell Scripts. 
  * Export to a .REG file. 
  * Hides Drives that you specify. 
  * Prevents Drives that you specify. (Some legacy applications file manager will undo the Hide Drive Setting, this stops access if it does )
