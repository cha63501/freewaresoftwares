**Publisher's Description**  
  

Copy Handler is a small tool designed for copy/move files and folders between
different storage medias (hard disks, floppy disks, local networks, CD-ROMs
and many other).

** Advantages of the program:**

  * copying data at up to 6-7 times faster than standard MS Windows copying (when copying data from one partiton to another on the same physical hard disk)
  * allow full-control over the copying/moving process by pause, resume, restart and cancel features
  * fully customizable - over 60 detailed options - from setting language (multiple languages) through auto-resume on error, shutting down system after copying finished to very detailed and technical (customizing copy/move thread - buffer sizes, thread priority, ...) ending on sounds on specific events
  * multiple languages support - and more may appear, since the translation process is quite easy
  * provides detailed informations about copy/move process (currect file, buffer sizes, priority, progress by size and visual bar, status, current and average speed, time elapsed/left, ...)
  * can automatically resume all unfinished operations when system starts
  * limiting count of simultaneously processing tasks (copyings/movings) - tasks are set into a queue and are processed in order it was inserted into queue
  * integration with system - adds additional commands to context menus of folders and drag&drop menus
  * this program is open source - just download and use...

**What's New in version 1.31 Beta:**

  * Bugfix: changing language directory caused crash in some cases, 
  * Remove options for changing languages and help directories, 
  * Changed translation system to allow positioning of formatting parameters, 
  * Added functionality to check the home page for updates,

  * Added new library to the build - libchcore, which eventually will become the engine core, 
  * Replaced CArchive-based serialization with libicpf-based one, 
  * Bugfix: code detecting if the partitions lies on the same physical disk sometimes fell into an infinite loop, 
  * Added code for checking shell extension version at CH startup, 
  * Bugfix: miniview task selection was improperly painted on Vista, 
  * Mandatory registration of shell extension when installing CH, 
  * Added dbghelp.dll to the installation version of CH (win2000 have too old version),
