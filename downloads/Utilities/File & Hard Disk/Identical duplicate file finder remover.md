PackIt finds identical / duplicate files on your hard drives and/or network storage media (e.g. server drives, CD-ROMs etc.) using user-definable matching scheme, from partial to full match and byte-for-byte to CRC32 compare. PackIt complements Windows Disk Cleanup by searching for files that are copied to your hard drive and located in a few folders several times. PackIt can find files that have different file names, like "song.mp3" and "Copy of song.mp3". It is also very useful for finding and cleaning up identical downloads, especially on a multi-user computer. Redeem your lost hard disk space now!
