**Publisher's Description**  
  


The xcopy-command under W2K does not work correctly. Because of that, the author of From A to B decided to created a workable version. Of course the author extended the whole thing a bit... 

With this software youA'll have no problems copying all your data with an archive-flag from one folder A into an other folder B. This extended version is able to copy from n:n A and B folders. You can also use the regular copy-function. The created copy-report after copying can be saved in RTF, TXT or HTML.
