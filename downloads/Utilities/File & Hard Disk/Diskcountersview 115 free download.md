**Publisher's Description**  
  

DiskCountersView displays the system counters of each disk drive in your
system, including the total number of read/write operations and the total
number of read/write bytes.

It also displays general drive information, like disk name, partition number,
partition location, etc.

**System Requirements:**

This utility works on Windows XP, 2003, 2008, Vista, and Windows 7. Windows
2000 is also partly supported, but if you have one disk with multiple
partitions, all partitions will be displayed with the same counters.

**WhatA's New in version 1.15:**

  * Added 'Read Speed' and 'Write Speed' columns. The speed values are calculated according to the bytes counter change, and they are updated around every 3 seconds.
