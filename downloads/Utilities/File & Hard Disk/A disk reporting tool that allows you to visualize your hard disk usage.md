Disktective is a disk reporting tool that allows you to visualize your hard disk usage with pie charts, allowing you to quickly spot which directories use up the most space. You can navigate the directory tree and get a pie chart for each selected item, which can also be printed (in full color) or exported to HTML (text based) or proprietary tree format. 

The program is simple to use and does not require installation - just run the executable.
