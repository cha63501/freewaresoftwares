**Publisher's Description**  
  


NDFF is command-line utility that performs extra fast file searching on local NTFS partition. The main advantage over any other file searching tool currently available (including the one found in Windows Explorer) that it looks for file directly in MFT, which is system data table of NTFS. This approach lets avoid reading all the directories contained on the volume, thus speeding up the operation by many times.
