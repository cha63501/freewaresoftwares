**Publisher's Description**  
  

Drive Hider is a free tool to hide your local, removable, network or floppy
drives from being shown in My Computer or any File Explorer. When you run the
program, it presents the user with a list of all possible drives on a system.
The easy to use interface allows you to quickly hide a drive by simply ticking
the drive letter and saving the change. Once saved, users must reboot their
computers for the changes to take effect.

For added security, the program features password protection to prevent others
from "unhiding" your hidden drives.
