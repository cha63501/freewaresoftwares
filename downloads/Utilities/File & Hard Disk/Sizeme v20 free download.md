**Publisher's Description**  
  

SizeMe scans a selected directory for the size of each item. Then it compares
that to the given media size, and gives you a list over how many items you
need. Each item will contain how many percent a item takes. When you want to
copy/move/burn you can just dragA'nA'drop the items into any given place.

Example: If you want to burn your "My Documents" you might select CD (700MB)
and then it will create several discs as close to 100% full!
