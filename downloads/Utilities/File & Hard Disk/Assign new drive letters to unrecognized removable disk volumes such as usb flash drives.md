**Publisher's Description**  
  


SeeMe allows the user to assign new disk drive letters to unrecognized removable disk volumes, such as USB flash drives. When the application is run, it will identify all disk volumes. Removable disk volumes containing data but no drive letters (i.e., unrecognized volumes) will be prefixed with an asterisk. 

To assign a new drive letter, select an unrecognized removable disk volume that contains data. Click the A'GoA' button, or press the ENTER key. This will assign the selected disk volume to the next available disk drive letter.

**WhatA's New in version 1.1.3:**

  * Added: disk numbers are now shown in display.
