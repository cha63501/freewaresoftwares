**Publisher's Description**  
  

A Windows Utility to calculate checksums, crc16, crc32 AND md5 values for
multiple files using a Windows Explorer style interface. Useful for finding
duplicate files and/or files that have changed between directories.

Please note, there are various different CRC methods, I have chosen as default
the methods I believe to be the most popular, although alternatives can be
configured too. See readme.txt Notes section for more detail.

The intended audience for this utility is not the complete novice, and as
such, performing certain tasks requires a couple or more tasks to be
performed. In this way, the functionalty will remain, without sacrificing
flexibility.

Example: Removing identical files from the list requires that you first sort
the list to group identical files together (preferrably md5). Now the list is
sorted, clicking flag adjacent identicals will flag all files next to each
other in the list where all calculated values are the same. The flexibility in
this approach is that you have the option to have sorted the list in whatever
fashion before this operation.

eg1. You may have also sorted by file name so that only identical files with
also the same name are flagged.

eg2. You may have flagged some files you want excluded from this operation and
sorted the list by flagged first. (then removed all flagged).
