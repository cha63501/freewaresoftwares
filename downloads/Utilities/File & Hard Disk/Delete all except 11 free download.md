**Publisher's Description**  
  

This tool can be used to delete files in a folder tree leaving out certain
files. Right now only two types of filters are supported:

  1. Complete filename: Example - if abcd.doc is entered, all files except abcd.doc will be deleted. 
  2. Only extension: Example - if *.doc is entered, all files except files with extension .doc will be deleted. This means if you have files like MyDoc.doc, Resume.doc etc will not be deleted. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.1:**

  * Multiple filters can be entered. They have to be comma separated.
