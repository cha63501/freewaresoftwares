Primitive Disk Indexer is a simple program that will allow you to save the
file structure of any disk. It will allow you to view what folders and files
there are on a disk even if you do not have this disk.

For example, if you have a large CD and DVD collection, you will be able to
view what files there are on any disk without even having to touch that disk
and insert it into the CD drive. Disks of any type are supported.

The program is absolutely free and does not require installation. The program
has an Explorer-like interface. Disks of any type are supported: floppy disks,
CDs, DVDs, hard disks, USB disks and others.
