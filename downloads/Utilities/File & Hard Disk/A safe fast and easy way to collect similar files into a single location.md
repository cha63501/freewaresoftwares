**Publisher's Description**  
  


A safe, fast and easy way to collect similar files into a single location. 

**Features:**

  * Performs a recursive search for all files matching the specified mask(s) [both DEFAULT and USER].
  * Will work with any drive (Local, Remote (Mapped) or UNC).
  * A list of A'collectionA' candidates is generated to select from. The candidates are automatically sorted into categories (USER, AUDIO, IMAGES, DOCUMENTS, MOVIES, DATA and OTHER).
  * A option to compare file contents when collecting automatically makes copies of files containing differing data but a duplicate name. This option negates the need for any user input when collecting and ensures that A'zeroA' data is ommitted.
  * 50+ default filespecs.
  * A'AdvancedA' incremental column sorting.
  * Fast.
  * Monolithic [Independent] [?](http://optionalreaction.com/articles/informative/MONOLITHIC_INDEPENDENT_SOFTWARE).
  * Useful for A'search and backupA' tasks. Especially useful for pre-windows-reinstall data collection (if used in conjunction with the Microsoft A'File and Settings Transfer WizardA').
