**Publisher's Description**  
  


File Blender is an extensible and customizable file conversion and processing tool. 

It uses external command line programs to convert or otherwise process files that are being dropped onto the interface.

You can easily extend its functionality by adding any program that supports command line arguments to its Actions folder, along with a simple configuration file that tells Flie Blender which files should be handled by each action and how.

File Blender requires no installation. The application itself is built of a single executable and a configuration file.

This download file is preconfigured with:

  * Image Converter (BMP, JPG, PNG, GIF, TIF) 
  * Audio Converter (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG) 
  * PDF/TIFF Splitter and Joiner
