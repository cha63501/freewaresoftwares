Starting from Windows Vista, Microsoft uses symbolic links and junction points
of the NTFS file system in order to make changes in the folders structure of
Windows and keep the compatibility of applications written for older versions
of Windows.

This utility simply shows you a list of all symbolic links and junctions in
the specified folder, and their target paths. It also allows you to save the
symbolic links/junctions list into text/html/xml/csv file.

NTFSLinksView doesnA't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
NTFSLinksView.exe.

**WhatA's New in version 1.12:**

  * You can now specify environment variables (For example: 'localappdata') in the folder path to scan.
