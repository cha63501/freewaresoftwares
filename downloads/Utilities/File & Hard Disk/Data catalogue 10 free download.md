Data Catalogue is an application that can be used to catalogue all files and
folders on your entire network including your local drives, removeable media
such as CDs/USB sticks and network drives. Using the integrated scheduler you
can keep historical records of the structure of all your file systems making

have been deleted or moved. The reporting tool integrated in Data Catalogue
lets you compare these historical instances so you can track how your file
