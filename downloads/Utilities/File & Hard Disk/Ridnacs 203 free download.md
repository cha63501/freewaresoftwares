**Publisher's Description**  
  

RidNacs RidNacs is a very fast disk space usage analyzer for Microsoft
Windows. It scans your local drives, network drives or single directories and
produces a tree view with a percentage bar chart column. This gives the user a
quick and easy way to identify the largest directories and it's very useful
for cleaning up the disk.

The result of the scan can be exported in different formats (XML, HTML, CSV,
TXT), so it could be printed or compared with future scans. Besides of all
these benefits RidNacs has an outstanding scan performance and it scores with
a small memory footprint.
