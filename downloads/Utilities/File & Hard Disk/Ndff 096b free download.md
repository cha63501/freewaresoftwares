**Publisher's Description**  
  

NDFF is command-line utility that performs extra fast file searching on local
NTFS partition. The main advantage over any other file searching tool
currently available (including the one found in Windows Explorer) that it
looks for file directly in MFT, which is system data table of NTFS. This
approach lets avoid reading all the directories contained on the volume, thus
speeding up the operation by many times.
