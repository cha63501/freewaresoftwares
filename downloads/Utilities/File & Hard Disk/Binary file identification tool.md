**Publisher's Description**  
  


Have you ever been in a situation where you donA't know what application can handle a file? Maybe because itA's without any extensions, or it just doesnA't make sense? This tool can help! 

TrID is a utility designed to identify file types from their binary signatures. While there are similar utilities with hard coded rules, TriID has no such rules. Instead, it is extensible and can be trained to recognize new formats in a fast and automatic way. 

TrID uses an XML-based database of definitions which describe recurring patterns for supported file types. The first 2,000 bytes of a file are examined for this patterns.

The database of definitions is constantly expanding; the more that are available, the more accurate an analysis of an unknown file can be. You can help! Use the program to both recognize unknown file types and develop new definitions that can be added to the library. 

Everyone will benefit from new definitions.
