If youA're the administrator of a network with 500+ users chances are your file servers are holding several million files.

With FileMaid you can examine any size file server to see what data is not being used and simply delete it. FileMaid is designed with an appealing, intuitive graphical user interface to allow easy detection and selection of unused data. FileMaid will allow you to browse files in an Explorer-like interface, selecting files and folders for deletion. Multithreading is used for performance and responsiveness and extensive error handling makes FileMaid a very robust application.
