**Publisher's Description**  
  


Hddb is a useful utility for finding required files within a few seconds. The need to search for and get files quickly becomes apparent to anyone who has used a computer for some time, as people accumulate files surprisingly fast. There are high chances that you have even forgotten about some files on your computer, let alone forgetting where they are located. 

You do not need administrator permission to use Hddb. You will only get a UAC prompt when you are building your database, not when you are making searches. If you install a build service, you will not get any UAC prompt.

Please note that you will need to build your Hddb database manually because the application does not auto scan for file changes whenever you launch it. The time it takes to build the database will depend on the size of the hard drive and number of files contained.

You can search for files using only parts of their names and extensions and then sort them by either time or size. The tool can also display folder sizes. Once you enter the required keyword, the application will give you a list of all relevant files. You can import the list to a text file. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.0.6:**

  * Fixed a critical bug that can cause database build failure. 
  * Improved installer to overwrite Hddb_Srv without error prompt. 
  * Fixed a small bug in keyword parsing
