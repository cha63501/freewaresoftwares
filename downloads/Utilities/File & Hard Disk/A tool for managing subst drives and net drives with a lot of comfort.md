**Publisher's Description**  
  


XSubst is a freeware tool for managing subst drives and net drives with a lot of comfort. It can create temporary or permanent subst drives, can create drive icons (shortcuts) to the desktop manually or automatically. With the optional shell context extension (sce) it can integrate the basic functions connect and disconnect into file explorer or professional file managers like total commander. 

Another comfortable function is to change the path of a subst or net drive without manual disconnect the drive, XSubst will do this in one step. XSubst shows all available drives (a-z) in a drive list with their corresponding paths and drive types. There are more comfort functions but i think for a first description this is enough.
