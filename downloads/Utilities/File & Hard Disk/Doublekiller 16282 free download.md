**Publisher's Description**  
  

DoubleKiller is a fast and easy to use application for finding and removing
duplicate files.

DoubleKiller searches single or multiple directories for duplicate files by
comparing any combination of file name, size, modification date and content.
Using user-defined masks like *.mp3 or *.dll you can limit the scan to files
that interest you or protect important files from being scanned. Furthermore
you can exclude files in a particular file size range or files with certain
attributes, like hidden or system files.

When the scan is finished a list containing all duplicates found is displayed
and you can manually or automatically select the files to be removed. The
result list can be sorted and exported to a textfile readable by both humans
and spreadsheet applications.

DoubleKiller is a stand-alone executable that does not need to be installed,
just extracted and run, and does not alter the system in any way without the
userA's prior permission.
