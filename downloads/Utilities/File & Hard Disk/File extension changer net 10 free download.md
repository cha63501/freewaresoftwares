**Publisher's Description**  
  

File Extension Changer .NET integrates in context menu of files and makes it
simple to change file extensions. You can obviously do it manually in Windows
but in that case either you have to enable the property of displaying file
extensions which will make them always visible or use other techniques like
Command Prompt and type it out manually.

File Extension Changer .NET avoids both and provides the easy way.
Furthermore, it does not install any shell extensions for context menu
integration instead it uses registry. Thus your system resources are not used
unnecessarily.

An advanced version of File Extension Changer supporting multiple files and
DragA'nA'Drop is also available as freeware.

**Features:**

  * Integrates in context menu of files for easy access. 
  * Can work with read-only, hidden or system files. 
  * Very simple interface and easy to use. 
  * Simple to install and remove. 
  * Completely FREEWARE. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
