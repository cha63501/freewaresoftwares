**Publisher's Description**  
  

The utility shows relative size of all elements (both files and directories)
in a directory on disk using a columnar diagram. It allows you to quickly
estimate how many space a file or subdirectory occupies on parent directory
and how space is distributed among the directoryA's elements.

**You can also:**

  * change parent directory 
  * view filesA' metadata (creation date etc) 
  * select sort order (by size and name) 
  * select linear, logarithmic and root scale of diagram columns 
  * view size in bytes, Kbytes and Mbytes. 
The utility uses color coding to present size information, so bigger elements
will be indicated with red and smaller one with green. It supports also
localization so youA'll be able to make it speaking your native language.

In addition, the utility saves parameters of its appearance between sessions
and can be controlled with command line parameters.
