**Publisher's Description**  
  

With MyFormat:

  * You can use it to format a 1.44Mb floppy. 
  * You can also format a floppy with TRACK 0 BAD. 
  * You can make this TRACK 0 BAD FLOPPY BOOTABLE using A'sysA' command after the format is complete. 
MyFormat is especially meant for floppies with TRACK 0 BAD. You can use it for
normal floppies as well. As per the developerA's knowledge the program is more
reliable than other format utilities. It can handle any number of bad sectors
on TRACK 0, except a bad BOOT sector.

The developer has tested the formatted floppies (by MyFormat) on all Microsoft
Operating Systems and the floppies worked perfectly.
