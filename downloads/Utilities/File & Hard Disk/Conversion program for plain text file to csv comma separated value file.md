Conversion program for plain text file to CSV (Comma Separated Value) file. The CSV files are often used to exchange data between different programs. Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet programs also use them. 

The plain text file (.txt) to convert must contains some control character (CRLF, TAB, ESC...) for data field delimitation. The text file may also contain some control character for line delimiter. If no line delimiter are present in the file, the conversion can be done by specify the number of field per line. During the conversion, it is possible to remove columns and/or lines by specify the number or by using filter value. If the resulting CSV file is not compatible with your program, you can try to fix the problem by changing the line delimiter and/or forcing the field separation with double quote.
