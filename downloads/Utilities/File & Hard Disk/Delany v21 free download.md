**Publisher's Description**  
  

DelAny is lightweight and powerful file deletion utility meant for files that
cannot be accessed/deleted with usual methods (Windows Explorer, Command
Prompt etc.).

DelAny is capable of deleting most files on non-rootkited Windows system.
DelAny supports interactive and command line modes.

Unlike other similar software DelAny doesn't install anything (no files,
services, drivers, hooks - not even temporary), it only efficiently uses
existing Windows features to accomplish its task. DelAny is designed as small
and simple tool for rare use so it has no great GUI - only open file dialog
box and a couple of simple questions. DelAny also supports command line mode.
