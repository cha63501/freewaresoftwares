**Publisher's Description**  
  


Disk2vhd is a utility that creates VHD (Virtual Hard Disk - MicrosoftAs Virtual Machine disk format) versions of physical disks for use in Microsoft Virtual PC or Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs). 

The difference between Disk2vhd and other physical-to-virtual tools is that you can run Disk2vhd on a system thatAs online. Disk2vhd uses WindowsA Volume Snapshot capability, introduced in Windows XP, to create consistent point-in-time snapshots of the volumes you want to include in a conversion. 

You can even have Disk2vhd create the VHDs on local volumes, even ones being converted (though performance is better when the VHD is on a disk different than ones being converted).

Disk2vhd runs Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP1, and higher, including x64 systems.

**WhatA's New in version 2.01:**

  * This update fixes a bug that could result in Disk2vhd crashing when converting to VHDX format and adds a command-line switch, -c, to have Disk2vhd use online copy instead of Volume Shadow Copy.
