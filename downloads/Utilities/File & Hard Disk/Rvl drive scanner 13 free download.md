**Publisher's Description**  
  

With RVL Drive Scanner, you can scan drives or folders. And in addition to
determining the total number of folders and files in a particular drive or
folder, the application also displays the number of normal, hidden, and system
files and folders. This display and the display of the current path can be
turned off if you are only interested in checking paths for CD or DVD
recording. This speeds up operation considerably.

This program provides additional useful functionality in that it can scan for
paths that will not be recordable on CDROM or DVDROM. Checking is provided for
the two most popular recording formats in use today: Joliet and UDF (Universal
Disc Format) with Joliet bridge.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
