**Publisher's Description**  
  

The New Fileorder was created to simplify backups of many files on CD-Rs with
650 MB, 700 MB ,DVDs or any size. In the long run it is not acceptable to copy
big data volumes into 650 repectively 700 MB (or more) sized folders by hand
to burn them afterwards. This job is now done by The New Fileorder.

The New Fileorder is completely realeased in Java. Therefore the Java
Development Kit is needed. Download the JRE or SDK from sun.com. **[JRE / SDK
