**Publisher's Description**  
  


The utility shows relative size of all elements (both files and directories) in a directory on disk using a columnar diagram. It allows you to quickly estimate how many space a file or subdirectory occupies on parent directory and how space is distributed among the directoryA's elements. 

**You can also:**

  * change parent directory 
  * view filesA' metadata (creation date etc) 
  * select sort order (by size and name) 
  * select linear, logarithmic and root scale of diagram columns 
  * view size in bytes, Kbytes and Mbytes. 
The utility uses color coding to present size information, so bigger elements will be indicated with red and smaller one with green. It supports also localization so youA'll be able to make it speaking your native language. 

In addition, the utility saves parameters of its appearance between sessions and can be controlled with command line parameters.
