**Publisher's Description**  
  

TestDisk is a powerful free data recovery utility. TestDisk was primarily
designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks
bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software, certain
types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally erasing your Partition
Table).

TestDisk is a free and useful program which queries the BIOS ( DOS/Win9x) or
the OS ( Linux, FreeBSD) in order to find the Hard Disks and their
characteristics ( LBA size and CHS geometry). TestDisk does a quick check of
your diskA's structure and compares it with your Partition Table for entry
errors. If the Partition Table has entry errors, TestDisk can repair them. If
you have missing partitions or a completely empty Partition Table, TestDisk
can search for partitions and create a new Table or even a new MBR if
necessary.

However, itA's up to the user to look over the list of possible partitions
found by TestDisk and to select the one(s) which were being used just before
the drive failed to boot or the partition(s) were lost. In some cases,
especially after initiating a detailed search for lost partitions, TestDisk
may show partition data which is simply from the remnants of a partition that
had been deleted and overwritten long ago.

TestDisk has features for both novices and experts. For those who know little
or nothing about data recovery techniques, the command line parameters /log
and /debug can be used to collect detailed information about a non-booting
drive which can then be sent to a tech for further analysis. Those more
familiar with such procedures should find TestDisk a handy tool in performing
onsite recovery.

TestDisk can find lost partitions for all of these file systems:

  * BeFS ( BeOS ) 
  * BSD disklabel ( FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD ) 
  * CramFS, Compressed File System 
  * DOS/Windows FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 
  * HFS and HFS+, Hierarchical File System 
  * JFS, IBMA's Journaled File System 
  * Linux Ext2 and Ext3 
  * Linux Raid 
    * RAID 1: mirroring 
    * RAID 4: striped array with parity device 
    * RAID 5: striped array with distributed parity information 
    * RAID 6: striped array with distributed dual redundancy information 
  * Linux Swap (versions 1 and 2) 
  * LVM and LVM2, Linux Logical Volume Manager 
  * Mac partition map 
  * Novell Storage Services NSS 
  * NTFS ( Windows NT/2K/XP/2003 ) 
  * ReiserFS 3.5, 3.6 and 4 
  * Sun Solaris i386 disklabel 
  * Unix File System UFS and UFS2 (Sun/BSD/...) 
  * XFS, SGIA's Journaled File System 

PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost pictures
(Photo Recovery) from digital camera memory and lost files including video,
documents and archives from Hard Disks and CDRom. PhotoRec ignores the
filesystem and goes after the underlying data, so itA'll work even if your
mediaA's filesystem is severely damaged or formatted. PhotoRec is safe to use,
it will never attempt to write to the drive or memory support you are about to
recover from. Recovered files are instead written in the directory from where
you are running the PhotoRec program.

PhotoRec is free, this open source multi-platform application is distributed
under GNU Public License. PhotoRec is a companion program to TestDisk and is
included in the download.

Downloads available for DOS, Linux, Mac OS X are located on the [developerA's
download page](http://www.cgsecurity.org).
