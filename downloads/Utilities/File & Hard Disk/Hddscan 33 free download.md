**Publisher's Description**  
  

HDDScan is a **freeware utility for hard drive diagnostics (RAID arrays, Flash
USB and SSD drives are also supported)**. The program can test storage device
for errors (bad sectors and bad blocks), show S.M.A.R.T. attributes and change
some HDD parameters such as AAM, APM, etc.

HDDScan can be useful for performing the regular **health test for your
drive** and predicting its degradation, so you will be able to prevent data
loss and backup your files _before you will have to contact a data recovery
service_.

Additionally, software can be used as a _hard disk temperature monitor_ and
reading/writing benchmark A performance graph is displayed for every test.

Supported storage devices:

  * IDE (ATA) and SATA HDD.
  * SCSI (SAS) HDD.
  * External USB drives and all major USB boxes (see Appendix A).
  * FireWire or IEEE 1394 HDD (see Appendix A).
  * RAID volumes made of ATA (IDE) / SATA / SCSI HDDs (surface tests only).
  * USB Flash (pen drives) A surface tests only.
  * SATA / ATA SSD A solid state drives.

Storage device tests:

  * Verification in linear mode A helps to determine if your drive needs data rescue, has recoverable errors or in its perfect shape.
  * Reading in linear mode A simpler, but faster disk check.
  * Erasing in linear mode.
  * Reading in Butterfly mode (synthetic random read).

  * S.M.A.R.T. tests running on ATA/SATA/USB/FireWire HDD.
  * Temperature monitor for ATA/SATA/USB/FireWire/SCSI HDD.

Additional features:

  * Reading and analyzing identity information from ATA/SATA/USB/FireWire/SCSI HDD.
  * Changing AAM, APM, PM parameters on ATA/SATA/USB/FireWire HDD.
  * Reporting defect information on SCSI HDD.
  * Spindle start/stop function on ATA/SATA/USB/FireWire/SCSI HDD.
  * Reports can be saved in MHT format.
  * Reports can be printed.
  * Skins support.
  * Command line support.
  * SSD SMART and Identity reports.
