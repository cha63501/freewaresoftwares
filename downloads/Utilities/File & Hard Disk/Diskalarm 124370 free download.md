**Publisher's Description**  
  

DiskAlarm allows you to view and to be alerted of temperature of your hard
drive in real time. Sounds and visual alarms are activated if the temperature
exceeds the programmed value. Temperatures are displayed in Celsius and
Fahrenheit. With the "System Tray" option, balloon tips appear in the taskbar
tray.

The "Options" button opens DiskAlarm options: run at Windows startup; show
alert messages when an application is in full screen mode; shows a button to
stop or resume the alarm; load or open a sound file for the alarm; when alarm,
Windows can go to sleep mode or you can run an application; few options for
the graph are also available.

Settings are automatically saved to a text file. A log file informs you of
most of the DiskAlarm events (start time, temperature, alarm, resuming from
sleep...). A graph allows you easily view changes in temperature for the
selected hard drive.

This program works with all version of Windows. If your system is Windows XP
or older, it requires the [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-
