Last Changed Files finds the 100 recent changed files on your hard disk or

created or last changed files on your hard disk. You see the following columns
in the top 100 largest files list: file name, full folder path, file size and
date of last change.

Furthermore you can select another drive or a specific directory (including
subdirectories) if you want. The file finder software starts automatically to

than 30 seconds to scan 200 GB. You can define an exclude list of folders,
which will not be scanned.
