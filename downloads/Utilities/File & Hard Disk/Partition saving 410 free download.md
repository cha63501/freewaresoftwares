**Publisher's Description**  
  

Partition Saving is a DOS, Windows and Linux program that is used to save,
restore and copy hard-drive, partitions, floppy disk on DOS, Windows or Linux
devices.

With this program you could save all data on a partition to a file (such as
you could save this file on a CD for example). Then if something goes wrong,
you can completely restore the partition from the backup file. You no longer
have to reinstall every piece of software from scratch. All you have to do is
restore the partition from the backup file and then update any software that
was modified since the backup was created.

Note: beware of software which installs or modifies files on multiple
partitions (e.g. Windows programs which update the registry or DLLs that may
be on other partitions). If one partition is saved or restored, you must
include others (otherwise, inconsistencies could prevent software from
running).

Partition Saving is able to compress data (using the gzip compression
algorithm) and split it up into several files (e.g. if you need to save a 2 Gb
partition onto a CD, this can be done by compressing it and, if necessary,
splitting it up into 650 Mb files). Most partition types are supported. In the
case of FAT (12, 16 and 32), ext2/3 and NTFS partitions, you can choose
between saving all sectors or in-use sectors only.

**Features:**

  * saving an element (hard disk, partition, floppy disk, device) 
  * restoring an element that was saved before 
  * copying an element 
  * copying a backup file created by this program, modifying its size or compression rate 
  * verifying created files 
  * updating partition definition in Windows 2000/XP/Vista registry 
  * updating BOOTSECT.DOS/BOOTSECT.BAK file 
  * exploring a partition 
  * simulating elements with created files 
  * creating files on a NTFS drive under Windows for use in saving 
  * cancelling bad sectors information of a filesystem 

**WhatA's New in version 4.10:**

  * it is the first 64 bits version for Windows and Linux. There is no major difference with 32 bits version, less fact that 64 bits Windows version is not compressed (so binaries are bigger). 
  * use of 1.2.8 zlib version. 
  * add of A'swapfile.sysA' file into list of swap files to ignore (added by Windows 8). 
  * clear to 0 of begin of swap files when restoring backup done with ignoring swap files. In case Windows is in hibernation mode when the restore is done, this avoid incoherency because Windows restarts from its hibernation state and disk content was modified. This does not change anything on backup files: restoring a backup created with previous version will reset begin of swap files and restoring with a previous version a backup created with this version will not reset begin of swap files. 
  * a correction to avoid program to block in some cases in case of execution cancel during a backup/restore. 

**Some minor changes into interface as:**

* pre-filling of file name and maximum size when several files are needed (as if automatic naming is used but with letting user capability to modify these values) as suggested by Barry Akin. In command line interface, pre-filled values appear between square brackets and hitting Enter key allows validating this pre-filled value. 
* display of directory content when asking for filename in command line mode if enterred filename contains wildcards characters or is a directory name.
