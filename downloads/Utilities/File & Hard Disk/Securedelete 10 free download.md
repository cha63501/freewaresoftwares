**Publisher's Description**  
  

SecureDelete is the tool you need if you have to securely delete a file.

SecureDelete rewrites the file 100 times, saves it to disk each time, and
finally deletes it. The original file is now forever erased and a disk reader
will find only ~ characters on disk where the file used to be.

SecureDelete can delete only one file at a time. Selecting Options --> Disable
warning will prevent a dialog appearing asking to confirm your desire to
delete the file. You must set this option each time you use SecureDelete since
the program is too simple to use Windows Registry to save persistent data.
