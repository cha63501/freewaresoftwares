**Publisher's Description**  
  

File identifier is a command line tool that permits identification of
different files, as well as extracting the metadata associated with those
files. Furthermore, the identification part of the software relies on a text
database (similar to the UNIX magic file) that can easily be modified and
extended.

Currently identifies about 600 file formats, and extracts metadata from about
30 major file formats including PDF, PNG, OLE (DOC), RIFF (AVI, WAVE), IFF
(AIFF, ILBM), EXE, SGML (HTML), RTF, MP3, ASF (WMA, WMV), TIFF and JPEG.

Optionally the metadata can be saved to a database that is compatible with
4DOS/4NT Description files. The tool can also generate simple HTML reports
that are configurable via CSS, as well as SFV Compatible CRC-32 integrity
verification files.

File identifier also automatically detects embedded xmp metadata and maps all
the extracted metadata to XMP schemas (including dublincore - ref. ISO 15836)
for easy classification. Finally, the identified files are classified
according to their MIME types, File format identifier (FFID) types and file
extensions.

Extraction of metadata stored in multiple languages is also supported.

This is the freeware version. The professional version also supports saving
reports to CSV files of all the extracted metadata.
