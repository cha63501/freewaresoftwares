**Publisher's Description**  
  


A free command line utility for MD5 and SFV files creation and verification.  
Fsum allows to generate and verify file hash values and/or checksums using any of the 11 most popular hash and checksum algorithms: MD2, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 (SHA256, SHA384, SHA512), RIPEMD-160, PANAMA, TIGER, ADLER32, CRC32.   
  
The most common use for fsum is checking data files for corruption (data integrity checking). A message digest or check sum calculation might be performed on data before transferring it from one location to another. Making the same calculation after the transfer and comparing the before and after results, you can determine if the received data is corrupted or not. If the results match, then the received data is likely accurate.   
  
Major features: 

  * Possibility to act recursively (fsum can operate not only on files from a specific directory, but also on files from all subdirectories of the specified directory);

  * Handles large size files (Tested on files with size up to 15 GB); 
  * Full compatibility with md5sum utility; 
  * Full .MD5 and .SFV (Simple File Verification with CRC 32 checksums) file formats support; 
  * Automatic recognition of checksum file format (.MD5 or .SFV) while checking; 
  * Reports files missing; 
  * Very fast (fsum was implemented using fast and highly optimized QuickHash Library).
