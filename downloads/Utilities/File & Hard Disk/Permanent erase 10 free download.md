**Publisher's Description**  
  

The purpose of this software is to permanently erase files, making them
unrecoverable by file recovery utilities.

A file is opened and each bit is overwritten with a NULL character. The file
is then saved with the new NULL content, and then deleted. You can optionally
add a menu item to the explorer context menu which enables you to delete files
when you right click on them.
