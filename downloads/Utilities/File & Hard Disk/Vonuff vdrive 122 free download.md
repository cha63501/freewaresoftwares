**Publisher's Description**  
  

Vonuff vDrive is a tool for mapping directories to a drive. It is very easy to
use, because it will bind to your Windows file explorer and generate a new
entry in your right-click context menu called "Map virtual drive...".

This menu will only appear when you focused on a directory, and if you focus
on a virtual drive mounted by this software, the popup menu will be "Unmap
virtual drive...".

To mount a directory as virtual drive follows the steps below:

  1. Choose a directory you want to mount as a drive, and then right click you will see the popup menu "Map virtual drive..." 
  2. Choose the "Map virtual drive..." menu and Select Map options: 
    * Permanent means the mounted drive will not disappear when you restart your computer. 
    * Temporary means the mounted drive will no more exist when you restart your computer. 
  3. Click the "OK" button, you will see a new drive mounted and the mount process will be finished. 
If you want to unmount the drive, please follow this steps:

  1. Choose the mount drive you want to unmap. 
  2. This drive will disappear, all done!
