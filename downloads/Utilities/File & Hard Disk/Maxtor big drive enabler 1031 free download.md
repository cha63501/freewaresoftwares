MaxtorA's Big Drive Enabler is a one step executable that enables support for
drives larger than 137 Gigabytes in Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 and XP Service
Pack 1. Maxtor Big Drive Enabler will take the guess work out of editing the
Windows registry by fixing an OS limitation. This utility is needed anytime a
Hard Disk Drive larger than 137 GB is connected to the motherboardA's ATA bus,
regardless of any system BIOS that supports 48-bit LBA.
