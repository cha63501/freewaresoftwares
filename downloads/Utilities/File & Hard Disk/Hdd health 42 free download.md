**Publisher's Description**  
  

HDD Health is a full-featured failure-prediction agent for machines using
Windows 95, 98, NT, Me, 2000 and XP.

Sitting in the system tray, it monitors hard disks and alerts you to impending
failure. The program uses Self Monitoring and Reporting Technology
(S.M.A.R.T.) built into all new hard disks, and can predict failures on your
hard drives.

A host of alerting features include email, local pop-up messages, net
messages, and event logging, while using no system resources.
