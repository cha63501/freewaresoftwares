**Publisher's Description**  
  

Use Log Dispatcher to simultaneously monitor several logs as they are updated
by their driver applications in real time.

Log Dispatcher supports custom filter lists. Each monitored log can have itA's
own individual filter list. Use Filters to store and apply filter strings that
invoke specified OS commands if the filter string should appear in the
monitored file. This could be used to configure a set of alarms or even build
a remote scheduler or command dispatcher by appending filter strings into a
remote control file that is being monitored by Log Dispatcher in real time.

Log Dispatcher could run on several servers each monitoring a single, common
control file. Filter strings could then be used to invoke simultaneous or
cascading actions on each server by appending them to the common control file.

To use filters, select A'FiltersA' from the A'EditA' menu item after opening a
log for monitoring. You can add or delete filter strings and their
corresponding commands here. The filter string can be any free form text. The
filter command can be any executable, script name, link etc... that is within
the execution space that Log Dispatcher is running on.
