**Publisher's Description**  
  


Access your hard disk on physical level and view areas usually hidden from you. 

DiskSpy enables you to view every sector of any installed hard disk drive. It is irrelevant if these sectors are bootsectors, partition tables, file system entries or simple data files. Also areas protected by the operating system are accessible, since DiskSpy is completely operating-system-independent. 

It has special features like text search, 8-, 16- and 32-bit display modes as well as big- and little-endian notation.
