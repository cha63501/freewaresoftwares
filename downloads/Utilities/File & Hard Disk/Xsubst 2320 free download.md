**Publisher's Description**  
  

XSubst is a freeware tool for managing subst drives and net drives with a lot
of comfort. It can create temporary or permanent subst drives, can create
drive icons (shortcuts) to the desktop manually or automatically. With the
optional shell context extension (sce) it can integrate the basic functions
connect and disconnect into file explorer or professional file managers like
total commander.

Another comfortable function is to change the path of a subst or net drive
without manual disconnect the drive, XSubst will do this in one step. XSubst
shows all available drives (a-z) in a drive list with their corresponding
paths and drive types. There are more comfort functions but i think for a
first description this is enough.
