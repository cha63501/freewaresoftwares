**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pismo File Mount Audit Package is a Windows application that allows users to
mount the contents of files to the file system as read-only and read-write
folders. Support for a variety of file formats is included.

Developers can add support for additional file formats and virtual file
systems using the included developer documentation and support files.

**Features:**

  * **ZIP reader** \- Most zip archive files can be mounted as read-only folders to allow access to contents, including the ability to execute contained applications. 
  * **ISO CD and DVD image reader** \- DVD and CD ISO image files can be mounted in place as a read-only folder. This allows direct access to contents through the file system, without first burning to media. 
  * **Private Folders** \- Private folder file systems can be created and used to store sensitive data files and applications in an encrypted and compressed container file. Private folders are created using a password to generate the encryption key. Once the password is provided at mount time, the protected contents of the private folder become accessible in place through the file system. 
  * **Explorer integration** \- Most functionality is available in the shell using context menus and drag-drop operations. 
  * **Full file system support** \- All built-in Windows file systems and 3rd party file systems are supported. Files on local, removable, and network device, can be mounted. 
  * **Command line interface** \- All functionality is available through the command line, allowing scripting and automation.
