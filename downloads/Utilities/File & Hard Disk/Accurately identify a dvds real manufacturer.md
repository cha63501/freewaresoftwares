**Publisher's Description**  
  


DVD Identifier retrieves and interprets the pre-recorded information that is present on all DVD+R/+RW, DVD-R/-RW and DVD-RAM media. This information contains a variety of parameters such as disc manufacturing information and supported write speeds. Even though this information is usually printed on the packaging, the brand name may differ from the actual manufacturer or sometimes there might not even be any packaging information at all. 

**What's New in version 5.2.0:**

  * Added detection of 6x bd-r discs (blu-ray). 
  * Updated manufacturer database, now containing over 900 discs from nearly 100 different manufacturers. 
  * Several other small changes and improvements.
