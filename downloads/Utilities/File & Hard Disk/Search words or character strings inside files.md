PRGrep is a combination of the standard search tool provided with Windows and the Unix "grep" utility: it searches a string (or words) in files and displays the lines containing this data. 

It is very easy to use (integrated in the Windows explorer) and offers a lot of advanced capabilities such as recursive search in sub-directories, filters on file names, various search modes (plain text, all words, one of the words, binary datas), results exportation, direct edition of found files, search inside compressed files, more.
