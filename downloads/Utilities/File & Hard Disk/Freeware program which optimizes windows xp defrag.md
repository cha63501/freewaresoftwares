**Publisher's Description**  
  


SpeeDefrag is the exclusive freeware program which optimizes Windows XP defrag. It restarts your computer which refreshes the RAM and then loads just the defrag.exe program. This imposes mininal load on the system and therefore defragmentation speed is increased. This program will also shutdown or restart your computer automatically once defrag is over. 

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The program offers 3rd party software which does not have to be installed to use the software.
