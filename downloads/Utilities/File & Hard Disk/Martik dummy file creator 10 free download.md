**Publisher's Description**  
  

Often we need test files during development, either to see how an application
behaves with differently sized files or just as a "payload" for various tests.

Martik Dummy File Creator is written just for this purpose - to create files.
They can be between 1 byte and 18 Eb (Exabytes, thats about
18.432.000.000.000.000.000 bytes) filled with garbage, random values or
zeroes.

**How to use**  
Choose a filename (type or click on the "Browse ..." button) and a size. The
size is made up by the number in the size field and a unit from the dropdown
list. The dropdown list offers Bytes, Kb, Mb, Gb, Tb, Pb and Eb (each being a
1000 times bigger than the previous). The resulting file size in bytes is
shown in the field at the bottom.

The checkbox "Random Content" fills the file with, who would have guessed
this, random bytes. The "Quick Create" checkbox is used to create a file quick
and filled with garbage. Technically it uses SetFilePointer() to set the end
of the file, which results in nothing being written to the file but allocates
the disk space for its contents.

By default, the quick create also checks the random content.

If you are using NTFS with file compression enabled, you can easily create a
10 Tb (or even bigger) file on any hard disk if you do not enable the random
content or quick create options.

Simple, if none of these options is enabled then the program will write a
stream of zeroes to the disk which get compressed to literally nothing on the
file system. Any file which contains only all the same bytes allocates only
one unit for the directory entry.
