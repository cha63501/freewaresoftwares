**Publisher's Description**  
  


Drive Hider is a free tool to hide your local, removable, network or floppy drives from being shown in My Computer or any File Explorer. When you run the program, it presents the user with a list of all possible drives on a system. The easy to use interface allows you to quickly hide a drive by simply ticking the drive letter and saving the change. Once saved, users must reboot their computers for the changes to take effect. 

For added security, the program features password protection to prevent others from "unhiding" your hidden drives.
