**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pocket Killbox deletes files that cannot be erased from Windows Explorer. Get
rid of files that stubbornly refuse to allow you to delete them.

**Usage Information:**

Download this file and run the killbox.exe file. When it loads type the full
path to the file you would like to delete in the field and press the Delete
File button (looks like a red circle with a white X). It will prompt you to
reboot, allow it to do so, and hopefully your file will now be deleted.
