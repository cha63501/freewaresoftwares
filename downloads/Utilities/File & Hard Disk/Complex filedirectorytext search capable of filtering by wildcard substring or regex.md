**Publisher's Description**  
  


rexCrawler is a complex file-searching utility built on the Microsoft .NET v3.5 Framework. It is capable of searching both file names and file contents using plain text or regular expression matching. File names can also be filtered using the familiar Wildcard format (*.doc, etc.). The output of a given search can list both filenames and lines that match the contents filter. These results can be sent to both a file (CSV or text) and a DataGridView on-screen. Copying information from the on-screen display to the Windows Clipboard is also possible. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
