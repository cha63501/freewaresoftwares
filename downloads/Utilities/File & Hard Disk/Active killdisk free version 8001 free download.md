**Publisher's Description**  
  

Active@ KillDisk - Hard Drive Eraser is powerful and compact software that
allows you to destroy all data on hard and floppy drives completely, excluding
any possibility of future recovery of deleted files and folders. It's a hard
drive and partition eraser utility.

If you use FDISK, FORMAT utilities, or DELETE standard operating system
command for data removal, there is always a chance to recover deleted files
(using undelete file or some data recovery software) and use against the
owner's will. We highly recommend you to run this FREE utility for the hard
and floppy drives you want to dispose of, recycle, re-use, sell or donate to
somebody.

Active@ KillDisk conforms to US Department of Defense clearing and sanitizing
standard DoD 5220.22-M. The most secure Gutmann's data destruction method is
also implemented. You can be sure that once you clean up with Active@
KillDisk, sensitive information is purged out forever.

  * New Wipe function that wipes out all unused space on existing drives, not touching existing data. 
  * Professional package now includes Windows Vista-based Bootable Disk Creator that allows you to boot Windows Vista from CD/DVD, and to erase or wipe out your disks in Windows environment. USB Plug'n'Play devices are supported. 
  * The FREE application can be registered with a registration key without re-installation to be able to erase data using DoD 5220.22-M and other methods. 
This is security software for unrecoverable data elimination for any computer
capable of booting in DOS mode from floppy drive. It uses access to the
driveAs data on a physical level via BIOS bypassing logical drive structure
organization, thus it does not matter operating systems and file systems
located on the machine, it can be DOS, Windows 95/98, Windows NT / 2000 / XP /
Vista / 7 / 8, Linux, Unix for PC.
