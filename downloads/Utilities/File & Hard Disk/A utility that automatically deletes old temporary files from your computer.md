**Publisher's Description**  
  


EraseTemp is a utility that automatically deletes old temporary files from your computer. Unlike most other tools that by default delete all the temp files, this one only deletes the ones that are at least a day old (avoiding problems with files that may be needed). 

If you just run the application it deletes everything older than one day in the Temp folder(s). It looks in you personal Temp folder in Documents and Settings, the Temp folder in the Windows folder and, if present, C:Temp.

You can also use EraseTemp to delete old files, any number of days old, in any folder. The program also accepts command line parameters and can remove empty subdirectories. EraseTemp deletes files immediately after it is started, recommended for advanced users that want to take advantage of the commandline options. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html).
