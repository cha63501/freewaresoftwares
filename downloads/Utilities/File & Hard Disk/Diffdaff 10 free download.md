**Publisher's Description**  
  

DiffDaff enables easy comparison of files, folder comparison and the detection
of differences between two web pages. The variations are classified as
changes, deleted, non existing, and identical content. The variations are also
color marked. The source code is accessible and parallel scrolling through the
results is possible. Numerous options facilitate the work and simplify the
location of differences.

Additionally, the results can be numbered line by line or the line-breaks can
be eliminated. DiffDaff is suitable for searches involving version
differences, differences between websites, debugging source code, help with
the version administration, comparison of backups, folder relations and much
more. A learning curve is not necessary since the software and the results are
self explanatory.
