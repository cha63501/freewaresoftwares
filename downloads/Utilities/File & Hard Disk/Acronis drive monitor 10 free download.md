**Publisher's Description**  
  

Be alerted to possible hard drive failures, before they happen.

Acronis Drive Monitor is a free tool that will keep a close eye on your hard
drives, and alert you to problems that could indicate an imminent failure.

The program works with S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology) compatible drives, monitoring their spin-up time, temperature,
seek errors and more than 20 other parameters. If thereA's a problem then you
get an immediate alert, a warning icon appears in your system tray, and
double-clicking this provides more information.

The alerts are provided in a very clear and non-technical way, but if you want
access to the raw S.M.A.R.T. data then thatA's available, too - just click the
"S.M.A.R.T. parameters" tab and get an in-depth view on your driveA's health.

Drive Monitor also monitors the Windows event log for critical events that may
indicate worsening drive problems. These include file system corruption,
failed read and write operations, Volume Shadow Copy failures, and more.

And if you have an Acronis backup tool then youA'll also be warned if the last
backup failed, or youA've not backed up at all recently. (Of course if the
program is reporting significant problems then youA'd be advised to make a
full backup, right away, just in case the drive is about to crash.)

Drive Monitor is lightweight, easy to use, and doesnA't just rely on
S.M.A.R.T. data, like competing tools. And so itA's well placed to provide an
early warning of impending hard drive doom.
