**Publisher's Description**  
  


SyncToy 2.1 for Windows is an easy to use, customizable application helps you copy, move, rename, and delete files between folders and computers. 

There are files from all kinds of sources that we want to store and manage. Files are created by our digital cameras, e-mail, cell phones, portable media players, camcorders, PDAs, and laptops. Increasingly, computer users are using different folders, drives, and even different computers (such as a laptop and a desktop) to store, manage, retrieve and view files. Yet managing hundreds or thousands of files is still largely a manual operation. In some cases it is necessary to regularly get copies of files from another location to add to primary location; in other cases there is a need to keep two storage locations exactly in sync. Some users manage files manually, dragging and dropping from one place to another and keeping track of whether the locations are synchronized in their heads. Other users may use two or more applications to provide this functionality.

Now there is an easier way. SyncToy, a free PowerToy for Microsoft Windows, is an easy to use, highly customizable program that helps users to do the heavy lifting involved with the copying, moving, and synchronization of different directories. Most common operations can be performed with just a few clicks of the mouse, and additional customization is available without additional complexity. SyncToy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time; it can combine files from two folders in one case, and mimic renames and deletes in another case. Unlike other applications, SyncToy actually keeps track of renames to files and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder.

We have collected feedback from the discussion forum on the Windows XP Professional Photography web site, from customer feedback surveys, from a large number of professional and hobbyist photographers at Microsoft, and from various world-wide forums, sites, reviews and blogs on the web. Based on your feedback, the following features were added to this release of SyncToy:

  * Dynamic Drive Letter Assignment: Drive letter reassignment will now be detected and updated in the folder pair definition. 
  * True Folder Sync: Folder creates, renames and deletes are now synchronized for all SyncToy actions. 
  * Exclusion Filtering Based on Name: File exclusion based on name with exact or fuzzy matching. 
  * Filtering Based on File Attributes: The ability to exclude files based on one or more file attributes (Read-Only, System, Hidden). 
  * Unattended Folder Pair Execution: Addressed issues related to running scheduled folder pairs while logged off. 
  * Folder Pairs With Shared Endpoints: Ability for folder pairs associated with the same or different instances of SyncToy to share end-points.

  * Re-Architect Sync Engine: The SyncToy engine has been rearchitected to provide scalability and the ability to add significant enhancements in future releases. 
  * Sync engine is also more robust insomuch that many single, file level errors are skipped without affecting the entire sync operation. 
  * Sync Encrypted Files: Sync of Encrypted files works when local folder and files are encrypted, which addresses the common scenario involving sync between local, encrypted laptop PC folder and remote, unencrypted desktop PC folder.

  * Folder pair rename
