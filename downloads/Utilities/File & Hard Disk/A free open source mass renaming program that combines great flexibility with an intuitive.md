MA(c)tamorphose is a free, open source mass renaming program that combines great flexability with an intuitive interface. 

Allows many command line renaming operations in a single utility, perfect for those of us that need to rename large numbers of files and/or folders on a regular basis.

However, the ease of the interface ensures a one-time user (I need to rename 5 gigs of mp3A's) will not find it too frustrating to use.

**Main Features:**

  * Preview **every** item to be renamed before comiting changes.
  * Load all files in directory **and** in subdirectories (recursive renaming).
  * Undo renaming operation in case of mistakes.
  * Save **all** program settings to file for later use!

    1. Prefix
    2. Suffix

    6. Length modifications (padding, truncating, or both).
  * Renaming styles: combination of: user text, numbering, id3 tags, date, time.
  * Modifications: UPPERCASE, lowercase, Capitalize first, Title Style, sWAP cASE, A'DoRkIfYA'
  * Sequential numbering (enumerating) options:  

    1. Use integers, alphabetical, or roman numerals
    2. Pad with any valid character to any width.(integers only)
    3. Control step size, starting number, reset count.
