This tool is to assist users in working with Alternate Data Streams. The GUI

manner. After creation you can launch the file itself from the ADS or launch
via another application. This program is mainly designed to assit programmers

several purposes. So letAs say if you saved an executable to an ADS you can
launch the exe directly through the tool. If you wanted to view a text file
