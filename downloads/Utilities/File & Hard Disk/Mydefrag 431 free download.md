**Publisher's Description**  
  

MyDefrag is a disk defragmenter and optimizer (a maintenance utility to make
your harddisk faster) for Windows 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, 2008, and for X64. It
is freeware, no time limit, fully functional, no advertisements. Fast, low
overhead, with many optimization strategies, can handle floppies, USB disks,
memory sticks, and anything else that looks like a disk to Windows. Included
are a set of easy to use scripts for end users, a scripting engine for
demanding users, a screensaver, and a combined Windows plus commandline
version that can be scheduled by the Windows task scheduler or for use from
administrator scripts.

MyDefrag is extremely solid because it is based on the standard
defragmentation API by Microsoft, a system library that is included in Windows
2000, 2003, XP, Vista, and 2008. Most defragmenters are based on this API,
including the free defragmenter that comes with Windows and many commercial
defragmenters. Basically all MyDefrag does is send "move this file to that
location" commands to the API. The API is part of the operating system and can
safely move almost any file on the disk, without risk and while the computer
is in full use.

**WhatA's New in version 4.3.1:**

  * Added the Windows "bootstat.dat" file to the build-in list of special exceptions. 
  * To my great chagrin I have found that some programs can crash (most notably MySQL and uTorrent) if the disk on which they have open files is dismounted with the MyDefrag DismountVolume command. The command was used in the DataDisk scripts that were introduced in the previous version. I have now removed it.
