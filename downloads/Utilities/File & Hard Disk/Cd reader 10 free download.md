**Publisher's Description**  
  

This program was written for recovering data from corrupted CDs and DVDs. It
can reread for recovery, but the main goal of the program is doing this very
fast and also preventing the computer from becoming non-reacting. For this you
must use a CD-ROM drive whose data cable does not share hddA's cable. Using a
CD-RW drive also speeds up the process and can recover more data.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
