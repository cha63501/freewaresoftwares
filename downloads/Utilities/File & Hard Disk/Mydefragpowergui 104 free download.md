MyDefragPowerGUI is a Graphical User Interface which allows you to easily
select all the features of MyDefrag, a freeware defragmentation tool. But it
can do a lot more. MyDefragPowerGUI can schedule a defragmentation, install
MyDefrag or its screensaver but can also do some small maintenance to your
computer. It can be used to schedule a defragmentation of your system files
like pagefile and registry files.

MyDefragPowerGUI also supports CCleaner which can be used instead of the
internal cleaning function. It can also erase any information which is left
behind on your hard disk after erasing files.

MyDefragPowerGUI was created for people who donA't have the skills of an
advanced user but still want to use the powerful features MyDefrag has to
offer or for those people who like a GUI instead of using the command line.

MyDefragPowerGUI is compatible with U3, Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008
and Windows 7. The update function is more advanced and it updates the GUI
automatic without user intervention.
