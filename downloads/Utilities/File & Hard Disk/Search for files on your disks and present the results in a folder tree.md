**Publisher's Description**  
  


WildReplace is a search and replace tool that lets you search for files on your disks and presents the results in a folder tree highlighting the folders and files that have been found. Most programs of its kind display a plain list of results; WildReplace presents the information by mainting the folder structure of your disk, and highlighting the folders that contain files that have matched your search criteria. 

You can search for files with special attributes (Read-Only, System, Archive, etc.), files that contain a matching phrase (works with both Text and Binary files). WildReplace can also replace text on files, a feature that is really very powerful but should be treated with care. WildReplace can create backups of modified files, delete files that match your search criteria or move all matching files to a new location while preserving the same folder structure.
