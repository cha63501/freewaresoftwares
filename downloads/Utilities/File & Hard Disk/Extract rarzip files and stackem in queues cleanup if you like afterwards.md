**Publisher's Description**  
  


UnPacker is a fully automated extracting tool. This is not a WinRAR or WinZIP replacement but quite a useful utility when you want to extract large quantum of archives. 

The program makes a queue of every rar added to the list and extracts them one by one. This way you can peacefully play your games (or sleep) while extracting. It also has optional functions to cleanup (removing archives after extract). 

You should try it, it is free and youA'll get a notice when a program update is available to ensure youA'll always have the latest version. Other functions like minimize to tray, thread priority, etc. are also available.

  * Made the cleanup functions smarter, and fixed a small bug in the renaming feature 
  * Now possible to save unfinished extraction queue to file on exit and reload it on startup (or a crash) 
  * Logfile support added 
  * Also possible to rename the directory youAve extracted from 
  * Possible to pause/resume on Unpacker & Autocopy 
  * AutoCopy can now operate in quiet mode 
  * Possible to set thread priority 
  * Autoscan directories by given interval 
  * Check autoscanned archives against the SFV file
