**Publisher's Description**  
  

ImageUSB is a free utility which lets you write an image concurrently to
multiple USB Flash Drives. Capable of creating exact bit-level copies of USB
Flash Drive (UFDs), ImageUSB is an extremely effective tool for the mass
duplication of UFDs. ImageUSB can also be used to install OSFClone to a USB
Drive for use with PassMark OSForensicsA.

Unlike other USB duplication tools, ImageUSB can preserve all unused and slack
space during the cloning process, including the Master Boot Record (MBR).
ImageUSB can perform flawless mass duplications of all UFD images, including
bootable UFDs.

**Warning:** Due to the forensic nature of image duplication by ImageUSB, please ensure that you select UFDs with a storage size similar to the image you wish to duplicate. For example, if a 2GB image is copied to an 8GB USB Flash Drive, the drive will only be able to use two out of the eight gigabytes of storage space. In this scenario, users will need to reformat the UFD in order to access the rest of the storage space.

**WhatA's New in version 1.1.1014:**

  * Option to Zero the Master Boot Record. This will allow Windows to see the full size of the drive after reinserting. Windows should automatically prompt to format unrecognized drive. 
  * New warning message if you try to write an image located on any of the drives selected as destination drives.
