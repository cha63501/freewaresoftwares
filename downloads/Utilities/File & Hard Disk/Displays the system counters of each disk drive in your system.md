It also displays general drive information, like disk name, partition number, partition location, etc.

**System Requirements:**

This utility works on Windows XP, 2003, 2008, Vista, and Windows 7. Windows 2000 is also partly supported, but if you have one disk with multiple partitions, all partitions will be displayed with the same counters.
