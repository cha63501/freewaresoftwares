Do your programs use large temporary files on hard disk? Do you need to be warned when space has expired? FreeSpace monitors and tells you in real time how much free space is available on your hard disk. An attractive interface shows your total and free space for each drive as well as the cumulative totals. You can set alarms to keep you informed when minimum free space threshold levels have been reached. 

FreeSpace also allows you to conduct performance tests for your hard drives, and displays the results in an good-looking 3D graph.

You can also retrieve detailed information about the contents of drives and folders. After a quick scan, total, system, hidden, and read-only numbers of files and folders are returned, as well as the disk space they consume.
