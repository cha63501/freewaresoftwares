**Publisher's Description**  
  


File Extension Changer .NET integrates in context menu of files and makes it simple to change file extensions. You can obviously do it manually in Windows but in that case either you have to enable the property of displaying file extensions which will make them always visible or use other techniques like Command Prompt and type it out manually. 

File Extension Changer .NET avoids both and provides the easy way. Furthermore, it does not install any shell extensions for context menu integration instead it uses registry. Thus your system resources are not used unnecessarily.

An advanced version of File Extension Changer supporting multiple files and DragA'nA'Drop is also available as freeware.

**Features:**

  * Integrates in context menu of files for easy access. 
  * Can work with read-only, hidden or system files. 
  * Very simple interface and easy to use. 
  * Simple to install and remove. 
  * Completely FREEWARE. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
