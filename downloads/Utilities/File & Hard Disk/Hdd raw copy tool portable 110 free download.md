**Publisher's Description**  
  

HDD Raw Copy Tool is a utility for low-level, sector-by-sector hard disk
duplication and image creation.

  * Supported interfaces: S-ATA (SATA), IDE (E-IDE), SCSI, SAS, USB, FIREWIRE. 
  * Big drives (LBA-48) are supported. 
  * Supported HDD/SSD Manufacturers: Intel, OCZ, Samsung, Kingston, Maxtor, Hitachi, Seagate, Samsung, Toshiba, Fujitsu, IBM, Quantum, Western Digital, and almost any other not listed here. 
  * The program also supports low-level duplication of FLASH cards (SD/MMC, MemoryStick, CompactFlash, SmartMedia, XD) using a card-reader. 

HDD Raw Copy tool makes an exact duplicate of a SATA, IDE, SAS, SCSI or SSD
hard disk drive. Will also work with any USB and FIREWIRE external drive
enclosures as well as SD, MMC, MemoryStick and CompactFlash media.

The tool creates a sector-by-sector copy of all areas of the hard drive (MBR,
boot records, all partitions as well as space in between). HDD Raw Copy does
not care about the operating system on the drive A it could be Windows, Linux,
Mac, or any other OS with any number of partitions (including hidden ones).
Bad sectors are skipped by the tool.

If your media has a supported interface then it can be copied with HDD Raw
Copy!

In addition, HDD Raw Copy can create an exact raw (dd) or compressed image of
the entire media (including service data such as MBR, Boot records, etc).
Again, all filesystems (even hidden) are supported.
