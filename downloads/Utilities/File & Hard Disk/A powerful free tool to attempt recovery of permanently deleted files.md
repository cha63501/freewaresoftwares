**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pandora Recovery is a powerful free tool that provides its users an effective way to attempt recovery of permanently deleted files. And that does not mean restoration of a file from Recycle Bin. Pandora Recovery actually recovers files permanently removed from Recycle Bin, files originally deleted using Shift + Delete keys bypassing Recycle Bin and files deleted from DOS prompt. 

Pandora Recovery can scan the master file table on a drive to provide a quick view of files that have been deleted. A disk surface scan is also provided which allows a user to scan the entire surface of the disk for JPG, BMP, GIF and PNG files that may not be able to be detected otherwise. This even enables the recovery of the above mentioned file types after a drive has been formatted.
