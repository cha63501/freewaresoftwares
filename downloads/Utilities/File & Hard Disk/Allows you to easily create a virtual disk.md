Have you ever considered using a RAM disk? This is a virtual disk that you create in your computerAs Random Access Memory or RAM. One of the advantages of using a RAM disk is that it works faster than a physical hard drive. However, how do you create it? This is where SoftPerfect RAM Disk comes to your rescue.
