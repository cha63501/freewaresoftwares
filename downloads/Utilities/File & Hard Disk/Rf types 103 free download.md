**Publisher's Description**  
  

RF Types (Registered File Types) is a small utility that simplifies the
viewing of registered file extensions on your system.

Unlike the Windows utility that allows the same, RF Types allows you to see
which fileA's are registered for the "Open With" dialog, without your having
to actually do anything first.

**Features:**

  * View registered file types 
  * Filter "Open With" keyA's 
  * Import/Export registry keyA's (individual key, list of keyA's, whole registry) 
  * Backup registry and/or registry keyA's 
  * Save list of file types for viewing in Notepad, or alternative editor(s)
