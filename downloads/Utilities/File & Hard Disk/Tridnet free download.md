**Publisher's Description**  
  

TrIDNet is the GUI-.NET version of TrID.

Have you ever been in a situation where you donA't know what application can
handle a file? Maybe because itA's without any extensions, or it just doesnA't
make sense? This tool can help!

TrID is a utility designed to identify file types from their binary
signatures. While there are similar utilities with hard coded rules, TriID has
no such rules. Instead, it is extensible and can be trained to recognize new
formats in a fast and automatic way.

TrID uses an XML-based database of definitions which describe recurring
patterns for supported file types. The first 2,000 bytes of a file are
examined for this patterns.

The database of definitions is constantly expanding; the more that are
available, the more accurate an analysis of an unknown file can be. You can
help! Use the program to both recognize unknown file types and develop new
definitions that can be added to the library. Everyone will benefit from new
definitions.

N.B. You need to download the TrIDA's package (witch contains over 500
filetypes defs) to use this program. See the homepage for more info.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.
