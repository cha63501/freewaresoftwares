**Publisher's Description**  
  

Create Virtual Drives by associating folders of your disks with Drive letters.

Drive Folder associates folders with Drive letters making them to behave as
physical Drives. This is very convenient if you use specific folders to store
data files, multimedia, downloads etc. and you have each time to follow a
complex Explorer trespass.

In order to do so you have to create an appropriate batch file using the three
steps Wizard, and run it from the Batch Files Management panel.
