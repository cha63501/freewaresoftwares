**Publisher's Description**  
  


With RVL Drive Scanner, you can scan drives or folders. And in addition to determining the total number of folders and files in a particular drive or folder, the application also displays the number of normal, hidden, and system files and folders. This display and the display of the current path can be turned off if you are only interested in checking paths for CD or DVD recording. This speeds up operation considerably. 

This program provides additional useful functionality in that it can scan for paths that will not be recordable on CDROM or DVDROM. Checking is provided for the two most popular recording formats in use today: Joliet and UDF (Universal Disc Format) with Joliet bridge.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
