**Publisher's Description**  
  

DiskSmartView is a small utility that retrieves the S.M.A.R.T information
(S.M.A.R.T = Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) from IDE
disks. This information includes the disk model/firmware/serial number,
cylinders/heads, power-on hours (POH), internal temperature, disk errors rate,
and more.

You can use the S.M.A.R.T information retrieved by DiskSmartView to find out
whether there is any significant problem in your disk drive.

**System Requirements:**

  * Any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000, and up to Windows 7. 
  * IDE/SATA disk. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.05:**

  * Added 'Mark Odd/Even Rows' option, under the View menu. When it's turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to make it easier to read a single line. 
  * Fixed issue: The properties dialog-box and other windows opened in the wrong monitor, on multi-monitors system. 
  * Added 'Auto Size Columns+Headers' option, which allows you to automatically resize the columns according to the row values and column headers.
