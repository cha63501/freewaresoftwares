**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bytessence DuplicateFinder is a freeware program designed to detect all the
cloned files that you might have on your computer. Duplicate files have a
negative impact over your system because they waste valuable space, they
increase the antivirus scan time, they make defragmenting take ages and they
make it harder for you to organize your files.

BDF employs optimized detection algorithms and file filters so the scanning
time is greatly minimized. The detected files can be removed in no time with
the help of the automatic file selector and the predefined set of actions
(copying, moving or recycling).

  * Very easy to use
  * Wizard-like, multi-language user interface

  * Optimized detection algorithms (file size, CRC32 and bytewise comparison)
  * Duplicate detection by contents, dates, name, size
  * Employs file filters (date, attributes, size) to minimize scan time
