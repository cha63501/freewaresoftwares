**Publisher's Description**  
  

Monidir 2000 is a freeware tool that will monitor up to 20 different folders.
Files that are deleted, changed or added to the folders are reported via
e-mail or via an audible and visible alarm.

The program runs in the system tray and will scan your folders in user defined
intervals. When a change occurs, the filenames are gathered and sent via
e-mail to one or more recipients. Monidir 2000 requires a minimum of memory
and can monitor folders over a network.
