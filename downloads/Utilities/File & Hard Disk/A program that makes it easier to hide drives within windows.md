**Publisher's Description**  
  


Hidecalc is a program that makes it easier to set the registry up for hiding drives within Windows. This is useful if you need to lock down a machine to stop users from doing damage where they shouldnA't be or saving data where they shouldnA't be. 

It is ideal for hiding drives in Terminal Server/Citrix.

Running hidecalc will not alter anything in your Registry. It is the data files it creates that will make changes when executed.

**Features:**
