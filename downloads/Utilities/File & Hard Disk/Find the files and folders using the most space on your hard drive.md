Your computer has most likely collected some files and junk that you would like to remove to free up your system. To do this, you must first know whatAs taking up that precious space, which is where WizTree comes in handy. This free disk space analyzer scans NTFS volumes fast and displays the files and folders taking the largest space. 

**Display**

WizTree provides a simple list that displays the largest folders and files on top. Although the display may not be as intuitive as some users would like, it makes it easy to zero in on whatAs taking too much space. You do not need technical skills to use it.

**Using WizTree**

We noticed that we did not have to click the scan button for WizTree to start doing its thing. As soon as we selected a drive or partition, the application started assessing it. The initial scan assessed the entire drive, and the analyzer displayed folders and sub-folders, including hidden items, actual sizes and percentages. It sorted the contents of sub-folders by size, but we had the option to sort them by:

  * Name 
  * Modification time 
  * Number of folders 
  * Number of files 
  * Number of items 

WizTree also displayed the time it took to complete the analysis in seconds, which is the ideal measurement because it literally takes seconds to scan large drives. It works fast because it reads the partitionAs Master File Table containing all details about stored files. The application provides the choice to send unwanted files to the recycle bin or delete them permanently.

We opened folders up to the file level, and the application displayed details for substructures in real time without doing another scan. However, we noticed that it did not automatically reflect changes we made to drive contents when it was open.

WizTree has another section that displays the 1,000 files according to their sizes, which are calculated in terms of the drive percentage occupied. The context menu that appeared when we clicked on items included options to open containing folder, start Command Prompt console and copy location path.

**Pros**

  * Portable 
  * Blazing fast 
  * Easy to use 

**Cons**

  * Only compatible with NTFS drives partitions 
  * Does not refresh automatically
