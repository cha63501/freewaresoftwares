Maxiorel GUI4UPX is a simple frontend for the well known Ultimate Packer for
eXecutables, UPX. With this frontend you can choose file, set the compression
ratio and run the process. You can decompress files too. There is a visible
command for UPX. Since version 2.0 there is a possibility to process more than
one file. With Maxiorel GUI4UPX you can create BAT file with prepared
commands. I find it useful for developers.

**Features:**

  * simple use 
  * decompress ability 
  * commands for more than one file 
  * can create BAT file 

**How to use:**

Set path to the upx.exe. Check compression ratio. The nine is the best, the
one is the fast. Add files you would like to compress. Click RUN and wait.
