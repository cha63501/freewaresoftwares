**Publisher's Description**  
  

FIR is an archiver, files compressor, files encryptor, and converter.

FIR converts data files into ONE single BMP/GIF graphics file or FIR archive
file, with options to compress and to encrypt the data.

Data files can be of any type, for example, DOC, SCR, EXE, PDF, MPEG, BMP, and
HTM, etc.

The bitmap and GIF graphics files FIR generates are 8-bit graphicsA' which
look like a stereo picture; they are no difference from any other bitmap and
GIF files which you may open them with graphics software to view.
Alternatively you may simply archive your data files as A'FIRA' archive files,
which have the file extension A'.firA'.
