Although Windows comes with its own decent zip tool, there are many third-
party applications that pack more punch than the built-in program. One good
free zip utility is known as Bandizip, which comes in both portable and full
installer versions. The former is 4.0MB while the latter is 2.2MB. The program
is compatible with all Windows Operating Systems from Windows XP.

**Features**

Bandizip has a range of features that will suit both experienced and novice
users. For example, seasoned users can choose the elements they want to
include in menus, configure compression methods and select file associations
among others. The miscellaneous tab allows users to change the interface
language or choose a temporary folder although the program automatically
extracts files directly to chosen folders. They can also integrate it with
Windows Explorer via right-click menus for fast access.

This free archiver can pack and unpack Zip, ZipX, TGZ, TAR, EXE and 7Z
formats. It can also unpack many other file compression formats, including
RAR, JAR, CAB, ACE, APK, ALZ, ARJ, BZ, BH, BZ2, J2J, GZ, ISO IPA, IMG, LZH,
LZMA, LHA, TBZ, TBZ2, PMA, TGZ, UDF, TXZ, TLZ, WIM, WAR, Z and XZ.

Users can test the integrity of their archives, customize columns, edit
archive comments or rename files. Other features include:

  * High Speed Archiving 
  * Drag and Drop 
  * Multi-core compression 
  * Preview Archive 
  * Automatic extraction 
  * Creating self-extracting archives 
  * Creating or extracting multiple files 
  * Support for split archives 
  * Password protection 
  * Search function 
  * Support for Unicode 
  * Illustrated Help file 

**Why is this Free Archiver Special?**

One unique feature of Bandizip is its ability to skip already archived file
formats, which allows it to pack files faster than many archivers. The program
also extracts files directly to the chosen destination without using a
temporary folder, which further increases its speed. However, users can
designate temporary folders if they want. It is also possible to configure the
program to delete original files automatically after completing its tasks.
This flexibility lets it accommodate people with different preferences.

**Test Results**

We tested Bandizip with different file formats to gauge its actual
performance. Packing a mix of file types and programs was pretty fast.
However, compressing media files alone, which are already compressed, took
relatively longer.

Overall, using this free zip utility was straightforward because of its
minimalistic appearance. However, the lack of an Explorer-based layout when
browsing files can make it difficult for some users to find files quickly.
Nevertheless, we were impressed with the way Bandizip responded to mouse and
keyboard commands.

While itAs almost impossible to find one program that pleases everybody,
Bandizip is a robust free zip utility that brings many types of people on
board. Although the free archiver installs easily, it can only be installed in
individual user accounts. While this does not affect many people, it makes it
challenging when dealing with multi-user systems because it will need multiple
installs and more storage space.
