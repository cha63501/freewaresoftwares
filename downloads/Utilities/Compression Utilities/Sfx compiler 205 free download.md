**Publisher's Description**  
  

SFX Compiler is a freeware program which enables you to add multiple files
into one self-extracting file. This can be useful for distribution. If you are
a software developer and need to send your program to your users, you can
easily compile all your required files into one archive with a .Exe extension.
Non-software developers can benefit from this program too.
