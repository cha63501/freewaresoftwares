**Publisher's Description**  
  


Based on the Delphi-Zip library and coded by Ccy for S2 Services, this simple command line unzipper offers the advantage of not requiring command switches. Commands are interpreted according to argument order. The first argument is the zip file, the second is the unarchive folder and the third and more are files to be unarchived. 

If the second argument is extension-less, it is interpreted as a folder. Also note if no extension-less argument is provided in the second position the unzip folder is the current one. Several files to be unzipped can be placed in the 3rd, 4th, 5th etc arguments with a space as a separator (or 2nd, 3rd etc if no folder name is indicated).

No-frills has some additional advantages over for example zlib based unzippers. It unzips Microsoft Office 2007 files without an added a zip extension. It excels at unzipping corrupted zip and Microsoft Office 2007 files without the specification of additional options.
