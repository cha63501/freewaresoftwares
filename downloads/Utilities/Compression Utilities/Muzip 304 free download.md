**Publisher's Description**  
  

Muzip is an archiver which supports many formats: Zip, Tar, GZip, UUE, etc.

**Features:**

  * All formats are available for reading and writing: you can uncompress but create your own archives too in Zip, Tar, GZip and UUE formats! 
  * In an add request, you can compress a whole directory without particular files or sub-directories. 
  * Muzip displays the directories tree as the Explorer, whereas WinZip only has a simple list. 
  * The files and directories can be manipulated using various functions: you can add, delete, copy, move, rename, and create sub-directories... 
  * The selected file content is always visible in a preview area, which supports many formats. 
  * You can list the contents of an archive using various formats: plain text, HTML, CSV... 
  * Using scripts you can do a complex backup in a single click. With the Windows Task Scheduler you will even be able to do it automatically! 
  * An exclusive feature: it is possible to build the archive manually and not at each modification. This is very useful when you manipulate very big archives: with other compressors, each time you delete a single file, the whole archive is regenerated, which takes a lot of time. With the manual rebuild, you can make all modifications you want, and apply them at once. Muzip can even automatically switch to manual rebuild when the archive has a big size! 
  * Creation of very small self-extracting archives: with less than 16 Kb in addition of the Zip archive size, any Windows user can uncompress your archive without specific software. 
  * Muzip has a complete support of drag and drop: compress, move or copy the files of an archive with a single drag and drop 
  * Muzip is reachable in the Explorer context menu: you can compress files and folders and uncompress archives without needing to launch Muzip. 
  * Whereas many archivers only have a basic set of options, Muzip offers extended compression settings. You can compress an entire directory without only certain files, use a separate compression rate according to the files type, and more.
