**Publisher's Description**  
  


Universal Extractor is a program do to exactly what it says: extract files from any type of archive, whether itA's a simple zip file, an installation program, or even a Windows Installer (.msi) package. This is still a work in progress, but so far itA's proven quite useful and I feel others can also benefit from it. 

I should stress that Universal Extractor is not intended to be a general purpose archiving software. It will never replace WinRAR, 7-Zip, etc. What it will do is allow you to extract files from virtually any type of archive, regardless of source, compression method, etc.

The original motivation behind this project was that I wanted an easy, convenient way to extract files from installation packages, such as Inno Setup or Windows Installer packages, without pulling up a command line every time. In the process I got a little carried away and ended up throwing in support for every kind of archive format I possibly could find. 

It also, of course, includes support for additional formats, as well as the latest versions of support binaries such as 7-Zip.

**What's New in version 1.6.1:**

  * Added support for environmental variables (eg., specify 'temp' for debug dir) 
  * Added: support for XZ compressed files and txz/tlz archives via 7-Zip 
  * Added: support for Windows Installer merge modules (.msm) via MsiX 
  * Added: support for NBH files via NBHextract 
  * Added: translations for Armenian, Czeck, Persian (Farsi), Serbian, Swedish 
  * Changed: 7-Zip unpacking behavior; now attempts brute force extraction only after External PEiD scan; change due to aggressive .exe resource extraction in new versions 
  * Changed: Windows installer support (.msi, .msp) to use MsiX instead of msi2xml 
  * Changed: LZMA support to use 7-Zip for extraction 
  * Changed: FEAD support to use PEiD rather than TrID for detection
