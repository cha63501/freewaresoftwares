QuickZip is a powerful and fast compression utility.

QuickZip features no ads, no spyware and has been a completely free archiver

we aim to provide a cleaner and more powerful interface.

multimedia viewer, enhanced file list generation with grouping support. A
backup script generator Is included to provide one step backup support for
your files.

QuickZip provides easy to use filtering techniques (e.g. filename wildcards,
size) to search for files inside of an archive. You can also use archive
finder to search for matching archives on your hard drive.
