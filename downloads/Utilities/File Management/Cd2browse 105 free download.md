**Publisher's Description**  
  

CD2Browse allows you to easily create browsable HTML-based menus from ordinary
directory structures, and publish these menus on CD or any other media.

CD2Browse employs Javascript tree menus (or, optionally, a web-inspired self-
expanding menu structure) to provide a clean, easily navigated view of your
files. Manually creating an HTML index would take quite a bit of time.
