**Publisher's Description**  
  


FastCopy is the Fastest Copy/Delete Software on Windows. It can copy/delete unicode and over MAX_PATH(260byte) pathname files. 

Automatically, after whether the copy origin and copy destinations are HDD according to same physical HDD or is judged, it operates as follows.

  * Diff HDD: Reading and writing are done with the MultiThreading in parallel. 
  * Same HDD: Using big buffer, reading until the buffer becomes full, and writing in bulk. 

Because Read/Write doesnA't use the cache of OS at all, other processes (application) do not become heavy easily.

Read/Write performance is a near the limit of the device. Include/Exclude Filter (UNIX Wildcard style) can be specified.

It operates lightly because MFC is not used, and it makes it only from Win32 API.

Because all source codes have been opened to the public in the BSD license, you can modify this software.
