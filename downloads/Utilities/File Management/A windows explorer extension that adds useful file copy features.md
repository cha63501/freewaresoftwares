A Windows Explorer extension that adds useful file copy features. 

Windows has no built in way to copy a filename or folder listing to the clipboard. For a single file, you can use File > Rename, CTRL+C, then ESC to copy a filename to the clipboard, but this is quite tedious if you have to do this frequently or for lots of files.

CopyFilenames comes to the rescue! This adds an extra menu command to the context menu in Windows Explorer (this is the menu that pops up when you right click on a file). This command lets you copy the filename in one operation.

CopyFilenames can also be used to copy lots of filenames all in one go. By default, the filenames will be copied one per line. 

CopyFilenames also makes it very easy to copy the full path to a file. If you hold down SHIFT while selecting the Copy Filenames command, the full path to the file will be copied instead of just the filename. This path can then be pasted into any application that has a field for a path to a file, or into a file open panel.

This can be a real timesaver when you already have the right folder open in Windows Explorer, since you do no longer need to nagivate to that same folder in another application to use a file in that folder! 

**Features:**

  * Copies one or many file or folder names as text to the Windows clipboard 
  * Option to add file size 
  * Option to add file date/time 
  * Option to add full path to file 
  * Option to double up back-slashes, or use forward slashes, if full path added 
  * Option to quote filenames with single or double quotes 
  * Option to separate multiple filenames with newline, space, tab or comma 
  * Command to rename a file with text from clipboard (Paste Filename) 
  * Command to copy filename and delete file in a single operation
