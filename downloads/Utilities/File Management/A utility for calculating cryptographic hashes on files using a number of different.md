**Publisher's Description**  
  


FileVerifier++ is a Win32 application for verifying the integrity of files. FileVerifier supports various algorithms by means of dynamically loadable hash libraries. It is a pure Win32 C++ application and doesnA't have any dependencies other than what comes with Windows. Permanent installation is not required and may be burned to a CD or used from a flash drive. 

The FileVerifier++ Shell Extension is a useful addition to FileVerifier++. The extension adds a context-menu handler to Windows Explorer that allows one to hash a set of files and/or directories. The menu allows one to choose between the default hash algorithm and each installed algorithm.

**Features:**

  * Can load and save results to and from various formats. 
  * Hash algorithms can be added through the DLL interface. 
  * Hash verification. Can load hash results and compare to what is actually on your disk. 
  * Color coding of validity states 
  * Verification considers file size, file attributes, and modification date to be significant. 
  * Drag and drop support. 
  * Recursive directory processing. 
  * Calculates hashes on strings. 
  * Search and grep using regular expressions. 
  * Selective verification. 
  * Unicode support (recognizes Unicode file names and writes results encoded in UTF-8 (without BOM)) 
  * Supports Windows XP Visual Styles 
  * Shell Integration (Shell extension). 
  * Can be installed using installer or without. 

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows 2000 IA32 
  * Windows XP Home/Professional IA32 
  * Windows Server 2003 IA32 

**What's New in version 0.6.3.5830:**

  * A situation where the program would crash upon recalculating or verifying a list where a significant number of files are skipped initially has been fixed. 
  * A situation where the program will crash upon writing lists with entries with dates prior to 1/1/1970 has been fixed. Any dates prior to this will be set to 1/1/1970. This restriction will be lifted in future versions. 
  * A workaround for a condition causing a brief delay in the program exit on certain systems has been applied.
