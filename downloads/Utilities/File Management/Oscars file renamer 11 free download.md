**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Renamer takes and enhances the idea of editing files in directory in a
full featured Text editor and then writing all the changes at once into the
files.

It works simply: Open Renamer, select directory and the files will appear in
the File Name Editor which is a normal full featured text editor with some
additional changes (f.e. you canA't add or delete line). You can use all the
editor functions like Quick find, Replace, multiple Undo/Redo, Macros and of
course normal editing. Each file is on a new line and can easily move with
arrows like in a normal text. When the files you wanted to rename are done
simply click Apply Changes and all files will be physically renamed.

**Features:**

  * Fast Editing of long list of file names - exactly like in a text editor 
  * All changes to files themselves are done at the very end when you press Apply Changes, not during editing. 
  * During Editing you can use Undo/Redo, and various tools like Upper Case/Lower Case or numbering. 
  * All changed lines are visibly marked 
  * It doesnA't let you enter wrong characters 
  * A File List shows the original names on the disk. 
  * You can record a keyboard macro and apply to the file names. 
  * You can undo changes even after you write to disk 
  * It can integrate into windows Shell.
