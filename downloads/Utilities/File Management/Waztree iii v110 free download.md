**Publisher's Description**  
  

Waztree III file manager is similar to your operating system file manager with
a twist. It has two modes, Single drive path view with tabs to depict drives
and and traditional view with all drives in path view. The file manager is the
default starting point for all file viewing and file tools. WazTree III for
Microsoft WindowsA(r) XP/VISTAA(r) is a complete rewrite of WazTree II for
WindowsA(r). I have carried forward features that still make sense and added
of modified others to provide a more robust multi-purpose tool for your PC. So
whether you were a user or not, the program is made up of what people want
along with stuff that I just want to do.
