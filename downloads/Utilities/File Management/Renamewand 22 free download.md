**Publisher's Description**  
  

RenameWand is a simple command-line utility for renaming files or directories
using an intuitive but powerful syntax. Perform string operations (e.g. case
conversions, rearrangements of substrings), arithmetic operations (e.g. on the
numbers in the file name), insert running counters (e.g. to number files in
order of name, size, time), date and time stamps, and many more with ease!
RenameWand supports pattern matching using glob patterns and wildcards `*`,
`?`, `[ ]`, and `{ }`, as well as the special `_a_`>` capturing group
construct. RenameWandA's pattern matching is backed by JavaA's Regular
Expressions matcher. Runs on any OS with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE
5.0+). RenameWand is free software written in Java and released under the GNU
GPL license (version 2).

**Main Features**

  * Supports the common glob patterns and wildcards `*`, `?`, `[ ]`, and `{ }` for matching file names.
  * Use up to 26 registers to capture substrings using the `_a_`>` capturing group construct. For example, given the file "foobar.txt", the source pattern "`.****`" would have the effect of assigning registers `a`=foobar, and `b`=txt.`
  * A wide range of operations can be applied to the registers: case conversions (e.g. `AA`, `aa`, `Aa`), string truncations (e.g. ``), arithmetic operations (e.g. `b+c*da3`), and more.
  * Conveniently access the file name (e.g. `FN`), file size (e.g. `FS.kB`, `FS.MB`), file time (e.g. `FT.date`, `FT.time`), the current time (e.g. `CT.time`), and variants of these attributes through macros.
  * Use running counters for registers (e.g. `#`_a_), file name (`#FN`), file size (`#FS`) or file time (`#FT`) to automatically number files in order.
