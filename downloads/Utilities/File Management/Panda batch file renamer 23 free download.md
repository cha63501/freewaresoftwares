**Publisher's Description**  
  

Panda Batch File Renamer is an easy to use utility for changing the names of
multiple files. The intuitive interface provides a flexible way to quickly
alter file names.  
  
The current and final file names are shown side-by-side on the screen and any
changes are displayed on screen immediately. Information taken directly from
the ID tags of photo and music files can be inserted into the file name.  
  
Multiple renaming options can be queued up to make very detailed changes to
file names if required. A history of changes is kept, allowing them to be
undone if a mistake is made. Renaming options can be saved so that you do not
have to repeatedly recreate them.  
  
Many renaming options are available, including:

  * Insert [text / sequential number / date+time / music info / photo info / file info / image info].
  * Replace [block of text / section of text / accented characters / regex].
  * Remove [characters / numbers / letters / symbols / all text].
  * Change case / reverse text / trim text.
  
There is multiple language support.  
Further details can be found on the Animal Software forum.
