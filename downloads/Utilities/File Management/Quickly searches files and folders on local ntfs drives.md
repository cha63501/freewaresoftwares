**Publisher's Description**  
  


UltraSearch searches files and folders on local NTFS drives and provides the results within just a few seconds. 

UltraSearch does not use a background process to built an index, it achieves its speed by working directly on the Master File Table (MFT) of the NTFS partitions. You can enter a file name or a pattern like *.exe and will see the results already while typing. 

Additional information like file size and last change date will be shown for the listed files and the Explorer context menu is available inside UltraSearch. 

UltraSearch lets you exclude folders, files or file types by providing an exclude filter. The search results can also be printed or exported as text, RTF, HTML, CSV and Excel file.

**WhatA's New in version 1.8.1:**

  * Fixed 'Duplicates are not allowed' error on UltraSearch startup. 
  * Fixed access violations during search. 
  * Fixed 'Cannot focus disabled or invisible window' error when opening the exclude filter. 
  * When UltraSearch was started via the context menu, an additional blank was added to the search pattern erroneously. This is no longer the case. 
  * The advert banner is no longer displayed, if TreeSize Professional or Personal is installed. 
  * The settings of the portable version are now saved correctly. 
  * Numerous other bugfixes have been implemented.
