**Publisher's Description**  
  


Very cool, ultralight MD5 checksum utility. 109,630 bytes, no installation required. You can use MD5check.exe to verify the data integrity and authenticity of Microprosa download files (or any file, if you know the MD5 checksum of the original file). 

What is MD5? . For practical purposes, when numerically processed, every file or string of data bytes has a unique 128 bit, MD5 checksum. . So, if a single bit of data in a file is changed, its MD5 checksum will be different. An MD5 checksum (hash) is usually displayed as 32 hexadecimal characters, one for each 4 bits of the hash.

This is exactly the same MD5 process used by Microsoft and VeriSign, and other Certificate Authorities to verify software publishers and file data integrity using Digital Signatures. . Except, you check the fileA's MD5 checksum, manually, instead of Windows going online to VeriSign to check it with a digital signature. 

**MD5check.exe _Instructions:**

  1. Run MD5check.exe 
  2. In its window, click its "Open" button. 
  3. Then in the file selector pop-up window, select a file to check. 
  4. The fileA's 32 character, MD5 checksum (hash) will be displayed. 
  5. ThatA's it. So simple.
