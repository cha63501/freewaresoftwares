**Publisher's Description**  
  

HFSExplorer is an application that can read Mac-formatted hard disks and disk
images. It can read the file systems HFS (Mac OS Standard), HFS+ (Mac OS
Extended) and HFSX (Mac OS Extended with case sensitive file names).

HFSExplorer allows you to browse your Mac volumes with a graphical file system
browser, extract files (copy to hard disk), view detailed information about
the volume and create disk images from the volume.

HFSExplorer can also read most .dmg disk images created on a Mac, including
zlib / bzip2 compressed images and AES-128 encrypted images. It supports the
partition schemes Master Boot Record, GUID Partition Table and Apple Partition
Map natively.

You may be interested in the application if youA're:

  * A user of an Intel Mac running Windows with Boot Camp in need of accessing the files on the Mac OS X hard drive. 
  * Owners of HFS+-formatted iPods, that wish to access their content from within Windows or elsewhere (a user emailed me and verified that this works). 
  * Users of PearPC or similar Mac emulation/virtualization software that wish to access the contents of their virtual hard disks (will only work if the disk image is stored in raw format, as in PearPC). 
  * People that need to access the contents of HFS+-formatted .dmg files. 

HFSExplorer is written mostly in Java 5, optionally using some Java 6
features, with some Windows-specific parts written in C in order to be able to
get raw access to block devices, and to create a practical launcher
application.

Linux and OS X users should in most cases not need HFSExplorer for browsing
file systems on devices, since there are native file system drivers available
on those systems, but it seems to work fine if you need it. Linux users might
find use for opening .dmg files.
