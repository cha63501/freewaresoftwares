**Publisher's Description**  
  


Free utility to verify downloads with an MD5 checksum from the makers of MidWavi Pro (itA's only 100K and this is a true Windows program!). 

Tiny (100K unzipped) full Windows program to verify (and create) MD5 checksums (that is, where an MD5 code is given for a download file, using this software, if the codes match, the download is good).

You can also create your own MD5 checksum if required. It is truly a A'stand-aloneA' program in as much that is DOES NOT require ANY support software (i.e. NET Framework, or any DLLA's).

A Help file (59K) is available for download at: www.midwavi.com/md5.chm

No install offered, because it simply does not need it...just run md5.exe, and thatA's it!
