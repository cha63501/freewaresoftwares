**Publisher's Description**  
  

DragTargets is an attempt to make dragging/dropping files and folders a little
easier by providing convenient targets for regularly used folders, so avoiding
having to open Explorer each time.

It also provides a simple option for accessing folders that are used
frequently.

With DragTargets you can create a target button for a folder, including
external drives. Dropping files on a target will copy or move the dropped
files to that folder. Clicking on the target button will open the folder. You
can set up and save targets for future use.

Using DragTargets makes dragging as simple and convenient as it gets.
