**Publisher's Description**  
  


There would appear to be no easy (and free) way to search quickly for certain pictures within a given folder. Use this application to add search tags to JPEG image files and then search in a selected folder for images with such tags (This should work with both Vista and W7 with UAC turned off). 

Now has the option of writing bogus GPS data in order to obscure the location of pictures posted online, and linking this data automatically to Google Maps if desired.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
