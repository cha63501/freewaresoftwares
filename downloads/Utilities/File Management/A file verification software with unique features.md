**Publisher's Description**  
  


HashNET is another file verification software. The software is similar in functionality to QuickSFV and the now discontinued hkSFV. 

**Features:**

  * Support of multiple hash algorithms including CRC32, MD5, SHA1 & SHA256. 
  * Option of simultaneous file output, with different hashing algorithms. 
  * A new file format that supports Unicode and multiple hash strings in a single file. 
  * Nice GUI (Graphical User Interface) 
  * Partial Unicode Support 
  * Recognises and fully supports standard ".sfv" and ".md5" file formats (QuickSFV & Win-SFV32 compatible) 
  * Multithreaded Single Instance Application: This means only one instance of the application is running and operations are done in a queue, using a sexy interface. 
  * Integerates with Windows Explorer (thanks to AlexA's Library). 
  * Checks filenames for CRC match i.e. if the file name contains a matching CRC it will display it in the results list (See Help Guide). 

It has the ability to support all hash algorithms provided by the .NET framework though currently it supports four, functionality to support more can be easily coded in.

The program fully supports Unicode when creating simple verification files from the menu. However, currently explorerA's context menu depends on a great third party library, Fast Explorer Context Menu Extension DLL, written by Alex Yakovlev.

The new file format has the extension ".uvf" (Unicode Verification File or Unicode Validation File).

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows XP and newer NT based system (Vista, Server 2003) 
  * [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-x-Final_program_16026.html)
