Creates a Folder from any File and moves that File to its newly created
Folder. Primary Driver for this Application was the need to shift movies into
their own folders to hold their metadata.

Running the Application, you can select at root level and include all sub-
folders or register the application with the shell and "right-click" on any
group of files to create their own folders and immediately move them into
their new folders.
