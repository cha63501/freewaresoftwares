**Publisher's Description**  
  


Simple file verification (SFV) is a file format for storing CRC32 checksums of files to verify the integrity of files. SFV is used to verify that a file has not been corrupted, but does not otherwise verify its authenticity. The ".sfv" file extension is usually used for SFV files. 

Simple SFV Manager is extremely easy to use and simple application to both create SFV files and verify existing files and folders against existing SFV file(s).

On validating existing files it checks all existing SFV files from the same folder. Also, when creating checksums, it first checks if thereA's already SFV file that contain the selected files instead of directly creating new SFV file. All result lists can be easily used for any other purpose by first selecting lines and then right clicking for popup to copy selection to clipboard.

**WhatA's New in version 0.9.2.2:**

  * fixed bug on including .sfv files into verify and create checksums too
