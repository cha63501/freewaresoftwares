**Publisher's Description**  
  


FileOrganiser was developed to replace A'ExplorerA', the main difference is that this uses 2 panes and has A'bookmarksA'. To make life much easier, especially for teachers. Two windows makes it simpler to copy FROM and TO. 

This is also several programs in one.

**Features:**

  * Replacement File Explorer. On restart returning to where you were. (AND MUCH MORE!) 
  * More accessible A'findA' or search function. 
  * Camera and USB pen detection. autodetects folder where your photos are. 
  * Info button, to find out where all the disk space is used. 
  * Extensive, flexible file renaming. (To make searches easier in the future!!) 
  * Save file/ folder structure to a text file, so this can be printed. 
  * Save to an html document your favourite internet links. (from Internet Explorer) This can then be uploaded to your Web site. 

**WhatA's new in version 1.800:**

  * Jam still at V8.13 and will probably remain, as maintainence is expensive, bearing in mind that I work on FileOrganiser for nothing!! 
  * Faster operation. 
  * Added valid drives icon to RIGHT side. 
  * 5 more rename profiles. (also fixed a few minor bugs around this area!) 
  * Added extra feature in renaming- fixed length text deletion. 
  * NAS icon automatically added to a drive button if A'NASA' found in its path. (can be re-defined under A'configurationA', then features 2) 
  * Download icon automatically added to a drive button if A'downloadA' found in its path. 
  * Back and up button (right click up button) now displays folder contents correctly. 
  * Fixed display to fileList: saves twice!! showing folder names only fixed 
  * Fixed A'find filesA' issue with invalid pointers. (appeared in JAM V8.3) 
  * When network path dosnt exist in drive icons fixed, causing an annoying delay. 
  * MyComputer icon now works correctly. And several other minor bugs. 
  * EXIFtool now at V9.39.
