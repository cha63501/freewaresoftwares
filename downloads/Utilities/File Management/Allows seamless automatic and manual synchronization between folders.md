**Publisher's Description**  
  


FileMyster is an administration tool that allows seamless automatic and manual synchronization between folders. It was developed to make life easier for admins where they can depend on FileMyster to do all their server synchronizations automatically. FileMyster can also be used to sync your music, movies, documents, etc.. between your computers. So FileMyster is perfect for office and home. 

FileMyster only copies latest or new files from source to destination folders based on user select file types, so say goodbye to manually checking file versions and types and let FileMyster do the rest. Sit back and relax!

FileMyster allows you to sync any folder you want automatically where you can assign different times for different folders (access permissions to the selected folders/machines is required).

FileMyster keeps a fully detailed log of every synchronization process. No worries sync and review everything later.
