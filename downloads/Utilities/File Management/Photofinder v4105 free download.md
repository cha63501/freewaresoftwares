**Publisher's Description**  
  

There would appear to be no easy (and free) way to search quickly for certain
pictures within a given folder. Use this application to add search tags to
JPEG image files and then search in a selected folder for images with such
tags (This should work with both Vista and W7 with UAC turned off).

Now has the option of writing bogus GPS data in order to obscure the location
of pictures posted online, and linking this data automatically to Google Maps
if desired.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
