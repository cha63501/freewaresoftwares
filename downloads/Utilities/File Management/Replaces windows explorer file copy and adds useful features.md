**Publisher's Description**  
  


NiceCopier replaces Windows Explorer file copy. It adds many features like pausing, resuming and it calculates the best copy speed. Its main goal is to improve the copy organization and GUI. 

**Features:**

  * File Transfer resuming/pausing 
  * Calculates best speed 
  * Better copy progress display 
  * a bit faster than windows copy 
  * Automatic Copy list saving/loading ( you can shutdow windows anytime. Nicecopier will continue when windows starts ) 
  * Save file-transfer status every 10 sec, in case of of a power loss, diconnect etc. 

NiceCopier shows a treeview of all files to be copied in the collision dialog. You can ignore, replace and rename the files there, if nothing is set the files will be REPLACED!

Since v. 11.9.1 you can set a folder to "replace existing". So all subfiles that exist will be replaced. That is know the default if you click the ignore-button in the collision dialog. To fully ignore a Folder you can tick the ignore checkbox or right-click the item and select ignore from the context menu.

At the moment itA's set to queue new transfers if one of the volumes your copying to/from is the same. There are seperate queues for local network and copying over the internet.

This program wonA't intercept move operations if itA's on the same disk. Windows does that fast enough (itA's just renaming anyway, elsewhere my program would copy it, and then delete the source... not very effective.)
