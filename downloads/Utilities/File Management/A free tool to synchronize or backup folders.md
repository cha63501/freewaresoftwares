**Publisher's Description**  
  


Analyzes two folders and compares the differences. Great for synchronizing large collections of media files such as MP3s, Videos, Etc. without copying every file. Save time by only copying the files that are new or different. Use "Clone Mode" to synchronize a folder to match a master folder. 

Also works as a great backup utility. Backup only the files that have changed for speedy backups. (not to be used for backing up entire hard drive as the program does not have the ability to backup system files)

**WhatA's New in version 4.1:**

  * Removed auto-update check as no further development is planned
