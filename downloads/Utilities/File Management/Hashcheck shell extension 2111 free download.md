**Publisher's Description**  
  

The HashCheck Shell Extension makes it easy for you to calculate and verify
file hashes/checksums from Windows Explorer.

First, HashCheck can process and verify the hashes/checksums stored in
checksum files--these are files with a .sfv, .md4, .md5, or .sha1 file
extension. Just double-click on the checksum file, and HashCheck will check
the actual checksums of the listed files against those specified in the
checksum file.

Second, HashCheck will add a "File Hashes" tab to the Explorer file properties
dialog so that you could easily check the hash of a file (or even multiple
files and directories) from Explorer. You can also save the results to a
checksum file.

Finally, if you want to create a checksum file but think that opening the file
properties dialog, navigating to the "File Hashes" tab and then clicking
"Save" is too much trouble, HashCheck simplifies the task by adding an
optional "Create Checksum File" command to ExplorerA's context menu. Simply
select the files and directories that you want to hash and create a checksum
file for, right-click on them, and select "Create Checksum File".

With HashCheck, you can consolidate the md4sum, md5sum, and sha1sum tools--as
well as any SFV creation/verification utilities that you might have--into one
fast, simple, free, light-weight (on 32-bit systems, the final installed size
is just 60 KiB), and open-source utility.

**What's New in version 2.1.11:**

  * [Installer] On Windows 7 RC and newer, Windows will no longer incorrectly display the "This program might not have installed correctly" message after installation. 
  * [HashSave] Fixed a bug that prevented HashCheck from appearing in the context menu when invoked from Total Commander on versions of Windows prior to Vista. 
  * [Localizations] Added Russian and Ukrainian translations. (translator: Yurii Petrashko) 
  * [Installer] Moved the installer's UAC elevation to right before the actual installation, instead of when the installer is first launched.
