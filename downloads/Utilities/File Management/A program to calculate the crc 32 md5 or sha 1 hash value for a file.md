A program to calculate the CRC-32, MD5, or SHA-1 hash value for a file. It is implemented as a shell extension, i.e. right-click on a file, in Windows Explorer, to calculate the hash value for a file. ItA's that simple!

Many web sites for example list the MD5 value of a file, so that when you download it you can check to see if the file on your computer is correct. Some FTP servers also let you retrieve the MD5 value of a file (via the XMD5 FTP extension).
