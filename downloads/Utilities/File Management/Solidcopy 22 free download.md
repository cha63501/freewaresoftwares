**Publisher's Description**  
  

SolidCopy is an industrial-grade FileCopy utility with safe result previewing,
extensive logging and fail-over retry mode for unstable media or network
conditions. Jobs/scripts may be defined and automated.

Extra cleanup options allow for removing named or partially named files,
removing files by filespec, removing files that exist in the target folder but
not the source, and removing files after a successful copy (move operation).

Safety features include a preview window prior to batched overwrites, complete
atomic logging details (with stats and ComputerName of executing machine), and
a NoCopy mode where a job can be tested without actually copying, or if only
delete operations are wanted.

SolidCopy is lightweight. It comprises about 1mb in a stand-alone executable,
perfect for keychain drives.

Free for personal, non-commercial usage.

  * added: multiple folders/filespecs 
  * added: Files to Skip option (suggested by Stephen Michael) 
  * added: persistent window positions 
  * added: main/preview buttons auto-resize
