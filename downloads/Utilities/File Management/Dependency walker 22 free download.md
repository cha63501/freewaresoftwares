**Publisher's Description**  
  

Dependency Walker is a free application that will scan any 32-bit or 64-bit
Windows module (ocx, dll, exe, sys, etc.) and build a hierarchical tree
diagram of all dependent modules. For each module found, it lists all the
functions that are exported by that module and which of those functions are
actually being called by other modules. Another view displays the minimum set
of required files, along with detailed information about each file including a
full path to the file, base address, version numbers, machine type, debug
information, and more.

Dependency Walker is also very useful for troubleshooting system errors
related to loading and executing modules. Dependency Walker detects many
common application problems such as missing modules, invalid modules,
import/export mismatches, circular dependency errors, mismatched machine types
of modules, and module initialization failures.

Dependency Walker runs on Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP, and 2003. It can
process any 32-bit or 64-bit Windows module, including ones designed for
Windows CE. It can be run as graphical application or as a console
application. Dependency Walker handles all types of module dependencies,
including implicit, explicit (dynamic / runtime), forwarded, delay-loaded, and
injected. A detailed help is included.
