**Publisher's Description**  
  

Visual Subst is a small tool which allows you to associate the most accessed
directories with virtual drives. It uses the same API like console A'substA'
utility, but makes it easier to create and remove virtual drives in a GUI way.

For example, you can reduce a long path like A'C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Platform SDK\Samples\Multimedia\DirectShowA' to just one letter. This provides
a quick and simple way to access most used files and directories.

Visual Subst does not require installation. It is fully portable because all
settings are stored into an INI-file.
