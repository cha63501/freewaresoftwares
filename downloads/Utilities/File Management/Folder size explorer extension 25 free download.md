**Publisher's Description**  
  

Folder Size for Windows adds a new column to the Details view in Windows
Explorer. The new column shows not only the size of files, but also the size
of folders. It keeps track of which folders you view, and scans them in the
background so you can see complete size of all files within the folder. ItA's
very useful for cleaning up your disk. Once you get used to having that
information available, a directory listing simply looks incomplete without it!
