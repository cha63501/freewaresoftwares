**Publisher's Description**  
  


With AnalyzeIt you can inspect any file to find extra information about it. You can discover the real file type [based on the content of the file] and fully detailed extension information: Program and/or extension function, File classification, MIME type, specific characters, Program ID, General notes and the company [+link] of the software used to create that type of file 

There is a special section for information about analyzed executables: ImageBase, EntryPoint, CheckSum, Import and Export table, PE Directories [Resource, Exceptions, Reloc, Debug Datas, Description, Global PTR, TLS table, Local Config, Bound Import] and PE Sections with specific info: Name, RVA-Relative Virtual Address, Virtual Size, RAW Offset-File offset, RAW Size, Characteristics. It can also detect what packer/cryptor/compressor/compiler processed the executable.

There is also a function to detect the OEP [Original Entry Point].
