**Publisher's Description**  
  

As you use your computer and create files and folders, their thumbnail images
will pile up on your drives. However, you may not even be aware of them
because they are stored in hidden archives. The files are preview images that
make it easy for Microsoft operating systems to open folders. All the current
Microsoft operating systems store the preview files in the Thumbs.db format.

The operating systems store the thumbs whenever users view folders as
thumbnails via Windows Explorer. Unfortunately, the systems do not remove the
files automatically, which means computers gather thousands of the files
stored in different parts of the hard drives. More often than not, users are
not aware of the existence of such loads on their computers.

So, how do you remove thumbs.db files that you do not even see?

This is where Thumbs Remover comes in handy. The program searches both
internal and external hard drives for Thumbs.db files. You can also use it to
search for the files in flash drives or selected folders. It then displays the
files found so you can browse them if you want. You can then select the ones
you want to delete.

If you are using Windows XP, 8 or 8.1, you can also use Thumbs Remover to
prevent your operating system from creating the files in both remote and local
folders. If you are using Windows 7 or Vista, then you can use it to stop the
process in remote folders.

You can integrate Thumbs Remover into the Windows Explorer context menu.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
