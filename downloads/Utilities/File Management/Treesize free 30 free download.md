**Publisher's Description**  
  

TreeSize tells you where precious disk space has gone to. It can be started
from the context menu of a folder or drive and shows you the size of this
folder, including its subfolders. Each folder can be expanded in Explorer-like
style to see the size of its subfolders. Scanning is done in a thread, so you
can already see results while TreeSize is working. The results can be printed
in a report.
