If youA've ever had to manually create large numbers of new folders in Windows you know how time consuming and frustrating it can be. New Folder Wizard can help you create thousands of folders quickly and easily. Options include numbering the folders, prefix and suffix text, zero padding, and using a text file as the source for folder names. 

Use this program to help you organize images or other files of your choice by easily creating the folders for you. Using the text file option makes new folder creation as easy as typing. Or, if you use an external program like Microsoft Excel you can create your own naming and incrementing scheme.
