**Publisher's Description**  
  

This tool "clones" or synchronizes folders between hard disks.

Its main purpose is to create backups of important folders and keep them up-
to-date. To achieve this, AuSynClone reproduces the whole directory structure
on the backup medium. After choosing source and destination, the tool will
only copy new or altered files (i.e. changed file size or time). Furthermore,
files and subfolders no longer existing in the source folder will be deleted
in the destination as well.

**Silent mode**  
Start the tool with parameter "-s". The synchronization process will start
automatically. As soon as AuSynClone is done, it exits automatically. No
interaction is required.
