**Publisher's Description**  
  

Mass rename hundreds or thousands of files in batches by using Search and
Replace, Remove Characters, Change Case and Add Text -- all for free.  
  
You can change the case to First Letter Capital (also called Title Case), and
even skip words like "to", "the", and "a" to prevent them from being renamed
to First Letter Capital case.  
  
Other features include: undo the last rename operation, preview results before
renaming, perform successive rename operations on the renamed files by
clicking the "up arrow" button, perform multiple rename operations at once
(you choose the order), redirect (copy) the renamed files to a separate
folder, advanced "File Exists" functionality, drag and drop support, rename
status information, and more.
