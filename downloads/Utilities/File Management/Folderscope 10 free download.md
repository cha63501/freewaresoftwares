**Publisher's Description**  
  

Folderscope is a free software utility for analyzing and reorganizing folders
of any size. It is designed to work efficiently even with extremely large
folders, and has been tested on a folder containing 800,000 files and 400
gigabytes of data. Folderscope presents the user a flat sortable list of all
the files contained within a folder (including the files in any of its
subfolders)...

Files and subfolders can then be browsed and marked in a variety of ways.
Marked files can be copied, moved or deleted all-at-once. All changes are
added to a scrollable Pending Changes list for inspectation before being
committed.

**Features:**

  * Get a quick and complete overview of the hierachical structure and content of a new folder you have received. 
  * Find the most recently modified files anywhere in a folder hierarchy of documents. 
  * Find the files and folders taking up the most space on your hard drive, and move them to a different drive. 
  * Find duplicate files (files with identical content) in your documents folder and delete them. 
  * Reliably copy the entire content of one external hard drive to another. 
  * Backup the files from your main hard drive to an external drive. 
  * Search for files of a paticular name (or partial path) quickly in a big hierarchy of files. 
  * Extract files of a particular type (for example image files) out of a hierarchy and move them to a different root folder.
