**Publisher's Description**  
  


Elyse is a file management system which solves the major problem with traditional methods of managing large numbers files on computers: paths and folders. Storing files in Elyse eliminates the need to decide precisely where to store a file, or to subsequently find where it was stored. Any logical method of grouping and arranging files can be used. In short, you the user are given the power to impose your own logic, and change your mind as often you like with just a few clicks. 

Files are stored within an Elyse database, which itself is a single file. Files can be added, extracted, deleted and arranged within the database. However, in a similar fashion to accessing files on the internet, they cannot be directly modified within the database. 

**Features:**

  * Sort and group all types of files effortlessly with drag and drop tagging. 
  * Duplicate file management is built in. 
  * Elyse is flexible, powerful and self-contained.
