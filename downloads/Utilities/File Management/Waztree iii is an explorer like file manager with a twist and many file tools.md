**Publisher's Description**  
  


Waztree III file manager is similar to your operating system file manager with a twist. It has two modes, Single drive path view with tabs to depict drives and and traditional view with all drives in path view. The file manager is the default starting point for all file viewing and file tools. WazTree III for Microsoft WindowsA(r) XP/VISTAA(r) is a complete rewrite of WazTree II for WindowsA(r). I have carried forward features that still make sense and added of modified others to provide a more robust multi-purpose tool for your PC. So whether you were a user or not, the program is made up of what people want along with stuff that I just want to do.
