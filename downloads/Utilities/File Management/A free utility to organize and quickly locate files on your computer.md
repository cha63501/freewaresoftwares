TagSpaces is a freeware that provides a handy platform for personal data management. Anyone who has accumulated many files on a computer will find it time-consuming to locate specific files even if they are grouped into relevantly named folders. This is where a data management application like TagSpaces comes in handy. As its name indicates, the software adds tags to files, making them easier to locate. 

**Using TagSpaces**

We installed TagSpaces without any hitch and started using it within a minute. The program featured an intuitive graphic interface that let us browse our files in an HTML5 web interface. It is compatible with many file types and can accept even more types with the help of plugins.

We needed to index the folder we wanted to work on and choose a name for our project. The program then displayed the folder, including its sub-folders and files, in a neat tree format. The left pane listed folders and sub-folders while the list of files contained appeared in the right pane. It sorted all the files in our directory depending on their formats. We used single mouse clicks to perform a variety of functions, including:

  * Opening files 
  * Renaming files 
  * Adding tags 
  * Deleting files 

The program also allowed us to easily create new folders, HTML and TXT files and mark down files. We created multiple tags for some files with similar characteristics. The tags were saved in the names of their corresponding files without creating any special database, which meant we could access them even without using the data management application. We could also assign priority levels to our files and include completion status for better organization.

To perform an action, we clicked on the dropdown arrow button next to the file extension to open a menu and then selected the action we wanted. Adding multiple tags was as easy as clicking check boxes to the right of the files and then clicking the ATag selected filesA button found at the top section of the program interface.

Once we had created tags, we could browse files normally or use the tags to access them faster. We needed to start by typing the A+A sign in the search box before typing the relevant tags, which enabled us to locate required files in a breeze. The program allowed us to choose our preferred viewing mode among folder, grid and list visualization styles.

**Pros**

  * Easy to use 
  * Gives fast results 
  * Can be extended using plugins 
  * Works offline 
  * Tags created can be used independent of the software 

**Cons**

  * Misses common features like Copy, Cut and Paste 
  * Does not add tags to folders
