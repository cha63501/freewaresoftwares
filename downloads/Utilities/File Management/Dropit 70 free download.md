**Publisher's Description**  
  

A tiny, flexible, hard-working tool to automate sorting and filing data files
and folders.

When you need to organize files, DropIt can eliminate much of the drudgery of
searching and manually opening folders and moving files around.

You can configure DropIt to perform 12 different actions on your files and
folders (Move, Copy, Compress, Extract, Rename, Delete, Open With, Create
List, Create Playlist, Create Shortcut, Copy to Clipboard, Ignore), filtering
files by name, extension, location, size, dates and/or using regular
expressions. You can even save sets of associations in profiles and associate
a profile to each desired folder, to scan monitored folders at a defined time
interval.

Drop a group of different files and folders on the floating DropIt image and
it sorts them to defined destination folders, compresses or extracts them,
opens them with associated programs or performs other defined actions.

For example with the Create List action you can create HTML lists with
Arrowistic, Casablanca, DeepGreen, Precision and other themes.
