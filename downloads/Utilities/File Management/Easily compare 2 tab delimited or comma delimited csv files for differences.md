TableTextCompare is a small utility that allows you to easily compare 2 tab-delimited or comma-delimited (CSV) files, and find out the difference between the 2 files. You can use this tool for comparing 2 different snapshots of data, created by other NirSoft utilities, like DriverView, ServiWin, USBDeview, CurrPorts, WirelessNetView, ShellExView, and many others...

TableTextCompare can make the comparison even if the records of the 2 files are not sorted in the same order, or if the fields are not positioned in the same order.
