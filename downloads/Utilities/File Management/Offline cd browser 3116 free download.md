Index and catalog your removable drives to get your files organized and
categorized. By indexing your drives (or folders), you can locate files stored
on CDs in just a couple of seconds, you can browse through the content of
disconnected network drives or simply email an image of your hard drive to a
friend. And all this without fees or ads disturbing you.
