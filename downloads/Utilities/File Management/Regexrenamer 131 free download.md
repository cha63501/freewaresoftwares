**Publisher's Description**  
  

RegexRenamer is a powerful user-friendly graphical tool used to batch rename
files using regular expressions. A regular expression is simply text that
contains special characters that together defines a pattern that can be used
to match text, in this case filenames. Using the power of regexes it becomes
easy to apply complex transformations to large groups of files that otherwise
would not be possible with plain match & replace.

Features include realtime regex validation, filename preview & conflict
detection, file filtering by glob or regex, flexible case-changing (change the
entire filename or just the section matched by a regex), and customizable
sequential numbering.

Includes support for network drives & network paths, renaming folders,
renaming into subfolders (replace Afile.txtA with Asubdir\file.txtA),
preserving file extensions, move/copy/backup before renaming, and more.

Contains complete documentation including examples, regex tutorial & quick
reference guide.

**What's New in version 1.3.1:**

  * fixed bug with Ctrl/AltGr modifier keys (copy/paste regex)
