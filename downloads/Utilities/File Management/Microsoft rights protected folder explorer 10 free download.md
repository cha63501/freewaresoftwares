**Publisher's Description**  
  

Rights Protected Folder Explorer is a Windows based application that allows
you to work with Rights Protected Folders.

A Rights Protected Folder is similar to a file folder in that it contains
files and folders. However, a Rights Protected Folder controls access to the
files that it contains, no matter where the Rights Protected Folder is
located. By using Rights Protected Folder Explorer, you can securely store or
send files to authorized users and control which users will be able to access
those files while they are in the Rights Protected Folder.

Rights Protected Folder Explorer works with Active Directory Rights Management
Services (AD RMS) in your organizationAs network to control access to Rights
Protected Folders. When you create a new Rights Protected Folder, Rights
Protected Folder Explorer allows you to select a policy to protect the
contents of the Rights Protected Folder, or you can create a custom policy.
The policies that you can select from are set by your networkAs AD RMS
administrators and are the same policies you can use in such applications as
Microsoft Word or Microsoft Outlook to protect documents and messages.

Rights Protected Folder Explorer supports both UI based support (for end-user
interaction) and command line support for automated solutions.
