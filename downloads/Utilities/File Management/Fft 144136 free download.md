**Publisher's Description**  
  

Lists the most recently modified files in a selected folder ("My Documents"
folder by default). For example, after a Windows startup, this program is
useful to list the modified files in a system folder. Select a folder: you can
use the "Folder" button or the "Current search folder" textbox; choose a time
(1 hour by default) and run search with the "Find" button. The list of the
found files is sorted by name and by time. A double-click in the listing
selects the current line and opens the folder containing the name of the file.

The "Options" button opens FFT options (files and folder filter, attributes
filter, show current search folder...). If you choose the "file/folder
counter" option, you can use FFT like a fast file counter.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
