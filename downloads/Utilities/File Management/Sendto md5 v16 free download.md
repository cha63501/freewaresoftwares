**Publisher's Description**  
  

SendTo MD5 is small utility that can calculate and compare MD5 checksums of
files or strings. With SendTo MD5 you can easily check the integrity of files,
compare different MD5 hashes or simply check if two files are identical.

Additionally you can search files with specific MD5 hash and benchmark the
time it takes to calculate MD5 hash from specific file.

**WhatA's new in version 1.6:**

  * Changed the threading code to use a single worker thread 
  * Changed the MD5 benchmark output to show more useful and readable info 
  * Removed 'MD5 Benchmark' from the main menu, as it's still not that useful 
  * Trying to close the application while operation is running, will now cancel all operations in the queue 
  * Changed the default highlight colors to be more distinguishable from one another 
  * Fixed a deadlock issue when adding thousands of files to the hash operation queue 
  * Fixed a bug where in rare cases continuing search operation would actually cancel the operation 
  * Fixed a bug where hash search would skip a file if its filename starts with two dot (..) characters 
  * Fixed a bug where canceling a benchmark operation would display an error 
  * Numerous other minor tweaks and fixes
