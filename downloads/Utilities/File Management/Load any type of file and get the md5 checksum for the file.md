**Publisher's Description**  
  


In cryptography, MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value. 

As an Internet standard (RFC 1321), MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications, and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files. An MD5 hash is typically a 32-character hexadecimal number.

MD5 Checker allows you to load any type of file and get the MD5 Checksum for the file. You then can compare the generated checksum with another checksum to verify that the files are the same.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
