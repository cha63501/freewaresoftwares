**Publisher's Description**  
  

dmFileNote allows you to create descriptions for any file, regardless of the
file type. ItA's like having the ability to create digital A'sticky notesA'
for your files.

In the past, the ability to create descriptions for files was limited to
certain types of files. For example, document files created using a well-known
word processor could have descriptions added to them because their design
permits it.

However, plain text files, as well as other document files from various
sources, are not designed to allow you to add descriptions to them. dmFileNote
is the solution!

**Features:**

  * Descriptions stay with files, even after copying/moving/renaming (NTFS required). 
  * Stores descriptions for any file you wish, without affecting the file contents. 
  * Easy-to-use interface with a simple textbox for entering and modifying descriptions. 
  * Extremely low footprint - does not require much memory or storage space. 
  * Allows file descriptions up to 32 KB. (over 30,000 characters) in size per file. Plenty of space for your notes, keywords, documentation, etc. 
  * Automatic "00_index.txt" index file creation and maintenance. These index files can be used by FTP clients and file cataloging software. 
  * Triple-redundancy method for file descriptions, providing a failsafe against them becoming lost. 
  * Integration with the Windows Explorer file manager shell. Instant context menu access to dmFileNote.
