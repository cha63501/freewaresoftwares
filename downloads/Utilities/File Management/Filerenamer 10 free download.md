**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you ever encountered the problem of renaming lots of files that all need
to be renamed according to some specific naming criteria? For example, you
have a thousand mp3 songs with the name of the website which they were
downloaded from, prefixed/suffixed to their filenames.  
  
Imagine that you just brought a disk full of wallpapers of your favorite
artists and when you decide to view them, you just couldnAt select a
particular file using your keyboard by pressing the first letter of your
favorite artistAs name, because they have digits or some special characters or
the name of the site which they were downloaded from prepended to their
filenames.  
  
Try this: open a folder containing some items, select some of the items and
press Ctrl + C or select Edit | Copy. Now press Ctrl + V or select Edit |
Paste. What happens, the items are copied to the same folder but now a ACopy
ofA is prepended to the original names. You now have a duplicate copy of the
same set of files.  
  
Or imagine, you simply want your name or your girlfriendA's/boyfriendA's name
to all your music, videos, documents or other files and folders.  
  
If youA've ever been in any of the above situations, youA've two options:  
  
1\. You can do all renaming manually.  
  
OR  
  
2\. You can use FileRenamer.  
  
I think using FileRenamer is a much better option because:  
  
1st because: It automates the process for you. 2nd because: It saves your time
and labor. 3rd because: It provides various other options. 4th because: ItA's
free. 5th because: IA'm requesting you to use it.
