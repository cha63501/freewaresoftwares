**Publisher's Description**  
  

Jvifm is a file manager with vi like key bindings. If you love vi editor, you
may love the Jvifm. Since the Jvifm is written in java, you have to install
JRE environment to run the application. Jvifm requires jre 1.6 or above and
Jvifm will try to open the file with AgvimA command as default action, so it
is a good practice to put AgvimA or Agvim.exeA in your path enviroment
variable.

Requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6+ or above. [Get It
