**Publisher's Description**  
  

Each time that you open a folder in Explorer, Windows automatically saves the
settings of this folder into the Registry. This utility displays the list of
all folder settings saved by Windows.

For each folder, the following information is displayed: The date/time that
you opened it, the entry number, display mode (Details, Icons, Tiles, and so
on...), the last position of the window, and the last size of the window.

This utility works on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003/2008, Windows Vista, and
Windows 7. Previous versions of Windows are not supported.

**WhatA's New in version 1.15:**

  * The 'Last Modified Time' columns now takes the date/time from the BagMRU key (instead of the slot key), which displays more accurately represents the time that the folder was opened. The date/time of the slot key is displayed under the new 'Slot Modified Time' column. 
  * Fixed issue: The properties and the other windows opened in the wrong monitor, on multi-monitors system.
