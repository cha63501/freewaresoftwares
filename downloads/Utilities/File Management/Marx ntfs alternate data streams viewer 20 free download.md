**Publisher's Description**  
  

Within Windows 2000 and above, additional data can be associated and stored
with a file, without impacting the file structure itself. This data is stored
in what is known as an Alternate Data Stream. This alternate storage area is
not reported or accessible via Windows and hidden from the end user.

Windows makes use of this area to store the location from which files are
downloaded to apply additional security restrictions. It can also be exploited
by hackers to hide files from the end-user. Marx NTFS Alternate Data Streams
Viewer is a free and little tool which will search for alternate streams and
allows you to delete them.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
