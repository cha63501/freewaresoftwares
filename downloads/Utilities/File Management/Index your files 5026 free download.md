**Publisher's Description**  
  

Index Your Files is an alternative way for you to Index and Search through all
your files or folders on Local or Networked Drives.

With plenty of stats about your files and various ways to manipulate them,
Index Your Files will provide an extremely user-friendly and powerful way to
manage your information.

Searching can be done by Name, Date, Size, Location, within the found file
results. Use Boolean operators to perform multiple keyword searches.

Use Windows Explorer context menus on found files. Use drag and drop, copy,
rename, delete.

Find your files and show them to you. View file content for found files text,
html, and graphics files. The [RESULTS DISPLAY] will display the filetypes
using an internal viewer, which saves time and greatly simplifies the process.

Index Your Files will save you time and make your work with a computer more
pleasant.

IYF can automatically update the indexes at any time selected , or at any
regular time , or time interval.

Using the file contents display means that it is not necessary in actual
practice to make a gigantic index which indexes *every word*.

For the person who works in many directories [folders] in the course of a day,
the entire dayA's work can be displayed in the found files window, allowing
quick checking for accuracy or review. One window will display the search
results from many different folders.

The indexes formed are compacted and do not take up nearly as much space as
similar products. Can be running in the System Tray with less memory than it
takes to open another Explorer window.

Index Your Files does not contain any malware, or similar, and does not write
to the registry.
