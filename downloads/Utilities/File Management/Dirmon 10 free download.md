**Publisher's Description**  
  

DirMon is a simple utility that sits in your system tray waiting for a user
configurable event to occur then springs into action.

**Monitor Types:**

  * File Created - This gets kicked off when a file is created in the directory. It will not wait for the file to finish being created before the process starts. 
  * After File Created - This gets kicked off when a file is created in the directory and waits for it to finish. 
  * File Deleted - This gets kicked off when a file is deleted. 

**Threading**  
Wherever possible the program runs in a single thread environment with the
exception of waiting for a file to complete.

**Command-line**  
Two command-line options are available. -autostart and -minimize

These will automatically start the monitoring process and minimize the
application to the tray. The commandline options will only function using the
last settings you ran the program with (saved settings).
