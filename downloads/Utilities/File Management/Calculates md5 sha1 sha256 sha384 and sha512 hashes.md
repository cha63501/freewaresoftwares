**Publisher's Description**  
  


HashTools is an application that calculates hashes for given files. It can calculate MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 hashes. 

HashTools can also add itself to the Windows Explorer context menu for easy access if desired. Just select a file to generate a hash for, click on the button for the type of hash to generate and watch the result magically appear. 

Once a hash is generated you can copy it to the clipboard, or you can paste a hash to check against in the AHash CompareA textbox and have HashTools tell you if they are the same or not.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html). 

**WhatA's new version 2.1.0:**

  * Changed: Added an update check notification 
  * Changed: Added a second progress bar to indicate total progress, not just file progress 
  * Changed: In Windows 7 the taskbar button now shows the total progress 
  * Changed: Hashes are now compared when manually setting a "compare hash", not just after hashing 
  * Fixed: Multiple instance detection now works much better
