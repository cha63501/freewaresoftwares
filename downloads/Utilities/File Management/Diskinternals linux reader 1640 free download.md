**Publisher's Description**  
  

DiskInternals Linux Reader is a newly developed software tool for providing
access to Linux file systems under Windows. You can use it whenever you want:
the program is 100% free. It lets you use a familiar ambience of Windows
Explorer for extracting information from Ext2/Ext3 file systems. The only type
of access possible here is read-only mode. It prevents you from interference
with Linux and guarantees stable work of your OS.

There are a number of evident merits of the program, which you should know.
The program provides for read-only access and does not allow you to make
records in Ext2/Ext3 file system partitions. This guarantees that the
interference in an alterative file system will not affect the work of Linux
later.

Apart from this, it is necessary to note, that it gives you an opportunity to
use common Windows Explorer for extracting data. A preview option for pictures
is one more pleasant point, which is worth mentioning.

While saving, it ignores file security policies. It means that it is possible
to access absolutely any file on a Linux disk from Windows. The program can
create and open images of Ext2/Ext3 disks.
