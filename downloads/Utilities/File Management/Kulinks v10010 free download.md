**Publisher's Description**  
  

Links organizer and Cataloguer. This program provides a comfortable interface
of sorting, searching of and working with files stored on your computer. It
works on OS Windows and uses an EasyTable database, which is not dependent on
configuration of the operation system (i.e ODBC and BDE). This feature allows
to copy the program and databases to other PCs.

The database stores links to files with relative and/or full path. New links
can be added either by the program buttons or using the Drag&Drop feature of
OS Windows file management systems (e.g. Windows Explorer). This program works
with as many databases as you wish. Databases can be created for different
topics.

For example, user can organize storing of music, video, and/or photo files, as
well as books, documents, internet links, etc. Program has also been equipped
with a capacity to store limited in size documents. All note fields have a RTF
format. This feature can be used to organize stories (e.g. your favorive
anecdotes and jokes), receipts, FAQs, etc.

There are three levels of grouping of links in databases - volumes, headers,
and topics. The names of these fields can be changed/customized by users. All
configuration of the program is stored in the database as well. A set of links
and descriptions could be attached by a program user. This program allows to
create CD and Intranet php/MySQL view of the database with link files.
