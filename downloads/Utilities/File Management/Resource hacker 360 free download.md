**Publisher's Description**  
  

View, modify, rename, add, delete and extract resources in 32bit Windows
executables and resource files (*.res).

Viewing Resources: Cursor, Icon, Bitmap, GIF, AVI, and JPG resource images can
be viewed. WAV and MIDI audio resources can be played. Menus, Dialogs,
MessageTables, StringTables, Accelerators, Delphi Forms, and VersionInfo
resources can be viewed as decompiled resource scripts. Menus and Dialogs can
also be viewed as they would appear in a running application.

Saving Resources: Resources can be saved as image files (*.ico, *.bmp etc), as
script files (*.rc), as binary resource files (*.res), or as untyped binary
files (*.bin).

Modifying Resources: Resources can be modified by replacing the resource with
a resource located in another file (*.ico, *.bmp, *.res etc) or by using the
internal resource script compiler (for menus, dialogs etc). Dialog controls
can also be visually moved and/or resized by clicking and dragging the
respective dialog controls prior to recompiling with the internal compiler.

Adding Resources: Resources can be added to an application by copying them
from external resource files (*.res).

Deleting Resources: Most compilers add resources into applications which are
never used by the application. Removing unused resources can reduce an
applicationA's size.

**WhatA's new in version 3.6.0:**

  * PNG icons support added.
