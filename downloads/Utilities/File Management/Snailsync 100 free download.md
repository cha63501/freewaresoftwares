**Publisher's Description**  
  

SnailSync is a tool for synchronizing folders, either on different computers
or to external disks. It is slimmed down to be as small and fast as possible.

SnailSync can save the current status of folders to a small file, which can
then be used for comparison on a different computer or at the same computer at
a later time. SnailSync can save the differences between folders to a single
compressed file, which can for example be sent on a USB stick via snail mail.

**Features:**

  * synchronize local folders 
  * save status for one or several folders (file names, sizes, timestamps and attributes), for comparison with corresponding folders on another computer, or on the same computer at a later time 
  * save all differing files to a single compressed file that can be used as source for a synchronization at a different location
