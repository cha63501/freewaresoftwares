**Publisher's Description**  
  

DSynchronize is a stand-alone utility that let you periodically synchronize
two or more folders on Hard Disk, Floppy Disk, LAN, USB Key, CD-DVD (with
packet writing software) and FTP server.

It is also possible to specify the time and the day to schedule the
synchronization to run, and to create some additional 'filters' for other
factors. Real-Time sync is also supported.

There is also an option to add the date and time of the sync to the name of
the folder, to obtain a series of backups, classified by date and time.

**What's New in version 2.30.2:**

  * Fixed a bug in copying large files, which occasionally caused the crash.
