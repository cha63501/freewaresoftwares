**Publisher's Description**  
  


Drag and Drop Shell Robot is a utility to help power users easily perform operations on large numbers of files and folders. 

You can create any number of configuration files by specifying a target application and various commandline parameters or options. To use the program, you simply select a configuration file and drag & drop files and folders onto the queue window, and click Start. Then sit back while the operation proceeds through your files. You can also export commands to a batch file instead of immediate operation. 

A good example of the use of Drag&Drop Shell Robot is in zipping or unzipping multiple folders. First the commandline for invoking the zip command is specified (youA'll want to save it for later reuse), and then drag your folders from windows explorer onto the folder queue. Press start to walk through the queue, zipping each folder in turn.
