**Publisher's Description**  
  

FreeFileSync is an Open-Source folder comparison and synchronization tool. It
is used for fast and easy configurable sync operations between two folders
without restricted or overloaded UI interfaces.

**Features:**

  * Compare files (bytewise or by date) and synchronize them. 
  * No limitations: An arbitrary number of files can be synchronized. 
  * Subfolders are also synchronized, including empty folders. 
  * Network support. 
  * Lean & easy accessible UI: Highly optimized for speed and huge sets of data. 
  * Algorithms coded in C++ completely. 
  * Focus on usability: 
    * Only necessary functionality on UI: no overloaded menus or icon jungle. 
    * Select folders via drag & drop. 
    * Last configuration and screen settings are saved automatically. 
    * Maintain and load different configurations by drag&drop, load-button or commandline. 
    * Double-click to show file in explorer. 
    * Copy & paste support to export file-lists. 
    * Delete superfluous/temporary files directly on main grid. 
    * Right-click context menu. 
    * Progress indicators, status information and error reporting. 
    * Sort file-lists by name, size or date. 
    * Display statistical data: total filesizes, amount of bytes that will be transfered with the current settings. 
  * Easy configurable commandline mode for automated synchronization. 
  * Support for filesizes > 4 GB. 
  * Option to move files to Recycle Bin instead of deleting/overwriting them. 
  * UTC (coordinated world time) is used when comparing file times avoiding problems with time zones or daylight saving time. 
  * Automatically ignore directories "\RECYCLER" and "System Volume Information" when comparing and syncing. 
  * Localized German version available. 
  * Delete before copy: Avoid disc space shortages with large sync-operations. 
  * Based on wxWidgets framework => Portable to many operating systems. 
  * Filter functionality to include/exclude files from synchronization (without re-compare!). 
  * Include/exclude specific files from synchronization manually. 
  * Create sync jobs via GUI to synchronize automatically (can be scheduled or executed directly). 

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes a toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.
