**WhatA's New in version 3.90:**

  * Fixed painting bug with the Path Bar. 
  * Added ability to send an ISO file to Windows Disk Image Burner. Don't know why, unless it is because I never remember it is in the context menu. Sadly, need Windows 7 and up to use. Under File menu. 
  * Added ability to create an ISO image from a data CD. Under File menu. Works on XP and up. Does not create ISO images of audio cd. 
  * Fixed bug in Drive toolbar refreshing incorrectly. 
  * Added the ability to open Registry Editor to a qualified key. This was something I needed and if others find useful we will try to enhance it. Under Tools menu. 
  * Just type in or paste a key and hopefully regedit will open to the key. Example: HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoft 
  * Removed the status bar at the bottom. Hints now shown in the title bar. Panel in file view will open on zip operations. 
  * Fixed the No Row Color for the Browse for Folder dialog not working. 
  * Change to language.ini.
