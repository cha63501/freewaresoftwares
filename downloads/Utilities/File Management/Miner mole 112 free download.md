**Publisher's Description**  
  

Miner Mole is a free and open source desktop search utility. It collects,
parses and stores data about files, folders, users or any other information
that can be obtained from a computer, for fast and accurate information
retrieval.

**How it works**  
Miner Mole, as a file indexer, walks through every file and folder, starting
from a selected folder, and stores any information it can retrieve: the file
name, path, file attributes and any other information you can get from the
file system.

Creation/Modified/Accessed times are stored as a whole and also individually
as year, month, day to facilitate queries by any of these parts.

For example you can find files created in July or find Winter photos, without
mentioning the year.

Miner Mole, as Active Directory indexer, can index users and all related
information to facilitate fast and complex queries.

Miner Mole, as Computer and share indexer, searches for computers in a given
IP address range and lists all available shares.

Miner Mole, as E-Mail indexer, will index specified Outlook folders and
extract keywords from subjects and mail bodies, save full email in database if
needed.

Data is stored in a scalable, high-performance, open source, document-oriented
database: MongoDB.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
