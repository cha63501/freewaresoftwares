**Publisher's Description**  
  


Nexus is an easy to use web-based file management application. It is meant to be used by small businesses as a centralized location to distribute files to clients, customers and employees. It is not meant as a replacement for hosted solutions like box.net. You, as an IT professional or technically savvy user can install Nexus on your web server and start sharing right away. This gives you the power to control security in a way you can only hope that the hosted solutions do. Also, this is ideal for an intranet environment where your users are your employees and file security is absolutely critical. 

Nexus is written in PHP 5 and requires a MySQL database. Some knowledge of web-based applications is required to set it up.
