**Publisher's Description**  
  

TCExplorer is a portable software to import, export, delete, and rename files
in TrueCrypt containers. TrueCrypt is a software system for establishing and
maintaining an on-the-fly-encrypted volume (data storage device). TCExplorer
is small, simple and does not require any installation.

**Features:**

  * Stay on top: TCExplorer may stay on top of other windows. 
  * Set current dir as temp dir: Set current directory as temporary system directory to store exported directories and files. By default, the system defined temp directory will be used. However if you do not wish to use the system defined temp directory, you can set this option to make TCExplorer use the application directory (which will usually be on a thumbdrive) as the temporary directory. 
  * View file size: View size of files stored in TrueCrypt containers. 
  * Save window position: Save last window position and size on closing and revert on next launch. 
  * Delete temp dir: Delete directories/files in temporary directory after exporting is finished. If unchecked, directories/files in temporary directory will not be deleted after exporting is finished so that users can use their own file shredder software to securely delete the temporary directories/files. 
  * Secure delete temp files: Securely delete directories/files in temporary directory after exporting is finished by overwriting the files with null characters and then renaming them to ~ before deleting them. Directories are also renamed to ~ before deletion.
