Directory Synchronize synchronizes the contents of one directory to another.
That means you can use Directory Synchronize to backup your data on a regular
basis to another PC or another hard drive.

Directory Synchronize can compare (e.g. size, modified-date, ...) and
synchronize an unlimited number of directories and has a detailed logging-
function.

Directory Synchronize is small, reliable, and fast. And best of all - it is
Open Source; released under the GPL you are free to use and distribute it. You
can also use Directory Synchronize to synchronize the data on your laptop with
the data on your desktop.

Use the Directory Synchronize GUI for starting, pausing and stopping a
synchronization. Or use the GUI to easily create and store a configuration and
use the command line to automatically start it every time you boot up your
computer.
