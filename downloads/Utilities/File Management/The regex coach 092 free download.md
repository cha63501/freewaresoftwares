**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Regex Coach is a graphical application for Windows which can be used to
experiment with (Perl-compatible) regular expressions interactively.

**Features:**

  * It shows whether a regular expression matches a particular target string. 
  * It can also show which parts of the target string correspond to captured register groups or to arbitrary parts of the regular expression. 
  * It can "walk" through the target string one match at a time. 
  * It can simulate PerlA's split and s/// (substitution) operators. 
  * It tries to describe the regular expression in plain English. 
  * It can show a graphical representation of the regular expressionA's parse tree. 
  * It can single-step through the matching process as performed by the regex engine. 
  * Everything happens in "real time", i.e. as soon as you make a change somewhere in the application all other parts are instantly updated.
