**Publisher's Description**  
  


DiskInternals Linux Reader is a newly developed software tool for providing access to Linux file systems under Windows. You can use it whenever you want: the program is 100% free. It lets you use a familiar ambience of Windows Explorer for extracting information from Ext2/Ext3 file systems. The only type of access possible here is read-only mode. It prevents you from interference with Linux and guarantees stable work of your OS. 

There are a number of evident merits of the program, which you should know. The program provides for read-only access and does not allow you to make records in Ext2/Ext3 file system partitions. This guarantees that the interference in an alterative file system will not affect the work of Linux later.

Apart from this, it is necessary to note, that it gives you an opportunity to use common Windows Explorer for extracting data. A preview option for pictures is one more pleasant point, which is worth mentioning.

While saving, it ignores file security policies. It means that it is possible to access absolutely any file on a Linux disk from Windows. The program can create and open images of Ext2/Ext3 disks.
