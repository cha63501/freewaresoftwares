**Publisher's Description**  
  

FF File Time is a program that allows you to easily modify the time stamps of
any file on your computer. It features an easy to use GUI that offers the
possibility to modify not only single but also multiple files or whole
directories. You can change a single time stamp or multiple at one time (Last
Modified, Last Accessed, Created).

Besides setting the time to a fixed value, FF File Time has the ability to add
or subtract a certain amount of time from any time stamp available. This is
useful for example if you have set your digital camera to a wrong, as you can
fix all file times at once with one button click.

FF File Time also has the possibility to read and write the A'EXIF HeaderA'
that is often used in JPEG images of digital cameras. This header contains the
original date and time the picture was taken.

A special button also allows you to (re-)set the "Last Modified" time to the
time found in the EXIF Header. This comes in handy when you have for example
rotated or postprocessed your images and still want to be able to sort them by
their original modification time.

**Features:**

  * Update one or multiple files at once 
  * Update one or more time stamps per file 
  * Add or subtract certain amounts of time to fix wrong time stamps 
  * Read and write EXIF Header of pictures 
  * Set A'Last ModifiedA' to original EXIF Header time 
  * Simple useage with Drag+Drop from Windows Explorer 
  * Sort file list by name or any time stamp
