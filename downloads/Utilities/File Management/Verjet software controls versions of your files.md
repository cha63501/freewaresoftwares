Now your files have history! 

Verjet software controls versions of your files. This means that you wonA't lose your intermediate work between many edits of documents. You have a full history of changes.

When you save a document, Verjet sends a copy to the repository; then you can access the previous revisions of the document by right-clicking it in Windows Explorer and selecting History.

It works with any file format: from simple text documents to Photoshop graphics, from Excel spreadsheets to source code.
