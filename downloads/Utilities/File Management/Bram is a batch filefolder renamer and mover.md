Bram is the batch file/folder renamer and mover. If youA've ever had a situation where youA've needed to rename a group of files or folders, and maybe even move or copy them to a different location after that, then Bram can help you! Features:

  * Naming scheme can include characters as well as...
  * Dynamic Naming Scheme Parts, which are parts that differ for each file or folder
  * New item names can be previewed before the names are applied
  * Changes to the new naming scheme are visibly tracked, reminding you to preview your changes
  * The are multiple apply modes: Rename, Copy and Rename, Move and Rename, Rename then Copy, Only Move, Only Copy, and Delete
  * If you mess up, you can undo the last set of changes you applied
  * You can apply the new names to only the selected items (Having nothing selected applies the new names to everything)
  * When displaying items, you can display either files or folders
  * When displaying items, you can either display only the items in a folder, or you can include all of the items in its subfolders as well!
