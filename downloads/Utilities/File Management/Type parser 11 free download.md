**Publisher's Description**  
  

Type Parser is used to get information on the usage of your drive, by grouping
similar extensions and showing how they are distributed on your hard disk.
This is a completely different kind of analysis that you have seen! For more
advanced users!

So you can "discover" forgotten files and then decide if they are worth
existing.
