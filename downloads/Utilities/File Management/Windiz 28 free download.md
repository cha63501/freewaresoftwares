other sort of text that has an overview of the software.

You could open each one individual, but that can be a boring and tedious task.
WinDiz will let you browse your ZIP files and will automatically show the

And if there isnA't any info file, you can simply type in the text box what
you want and WinDIZ automatically will generate file (or edit if it exists)
and compress it into the ZIP, with only one button press! The same browsing
