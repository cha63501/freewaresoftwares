**Publisher's Description**  
  

iStacker is an all-in-one CD/DVD collection catalog creator!

iStacker has been designed to make the task of searching for files and folders
in your collection extremely fast and easy. It analyzes your discs (whether
they are CDs, DVDs, USB keys, hard drives, even network drives!), and stores
their structure for browsing or searching.

You can browse the contents long after the disc has been put back into
physical storage, search for certain files or folders in seconds, set ratings
for discs, sort them into categories, annotate files and folders, and even
copy files from your collection at the click of a button!

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework
