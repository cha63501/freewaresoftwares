**Publisher's Description**  
  

File Joiner (.001 File Joiner) is a very simple and easy to use application
that will combine split files (with extensions: .001, .002, .003, etc.) back
into one file. Files with extension .001 (001, 002, ... 00n) are parts of a
bigger file that was split so they could be sent over newsgroup, file hosting
or some other service which limits maximum size of files that can be uploaded.

**Features:**

  * auto sorting of files with numerical extensions 
  * auto loading consecutive parts when you open or drag&drop file with extension .001 
  * auto output file path generator (file "c:\test.avi.001" will generate output file path "c:\test.avi") 
  * faster joining with option to append all files to first file 
  * MD5 and CRC32 hash calculation for output file 
  * loading files from folder and recursive loading from sub-folders 
  * option to associate extension .001 in windows explorer, so you can load files by double clicking the file 
  * progress bar to monitor the join operation (also win7 progress bar in taskbar)
