If you want to rename files, you will appreciate the help of a program that automates the process in some way unless you are dealing with just a few files. Perhaps you have a large collection of music or image files, which often come with pre-defined names that hardly give you any clue about what they contain. If you want to rename a group of files to have an organized and consistent structure, then you should consider Advanced Renamer. This is a free file renamer that will help you rename multiple folders and files simultaneously using a wide variety of methods. 

You can use the program to rename different types of files, including images, GPS data, songs, videos and TV shows. In addition to changing file names, you can also change attributes and timestamps. A few other great features include:

  * using wildcards and regular expressions 
  * real time preview of new names 
  * unicode support 
  * changing file extensions 
  * adding surfix and prefix to file name 
  * saving batch presets 
  * using multiple methods simultaneously 

The basic layout of Advanced Renamer gives access to almost all its features. While this is supposed to make it convenient, the layout seems rather crowded and can be confusing at first. The thumbnail mode displays miniature images of pictures to make it easy to arrange them for proper renaming.

**Installation**

Advanced Renamer comes in both installer and portable versions. We only chose the folder where we wanted to install this free file renamer and whether we wanted to create an icon on the desktop.

**Using Advanced Renamer**

We used the Columns dialog to customize the list display by moving, removing and adding columns. We also added size, extension and date. The Add Method menu gave us a wide variety of methods, and the New File name allowed us to view the effects of chosen methods. We selected several methods and applied them during a single batch operation. We also saved our selections for later use.

We used Advanced Renamer to organize the names of a few TV shows based on the details of particular episodes and season.

We did not only rename files but also tried to undo the changes we made with success. This is a handy feature because there are times when you may regret the changes you made. The test batch function is also very helpful in determining whether you have achieved the desired results.

**Pros**

  * Quick Installation 
  * Fast renaming 
  * Using multiple methods simultaneously 
  * Different batch modes - Copy, Move and Rename 

**Cons**

  * Too many options on the display 

**Conclusion**

If you want to rename files in a variety of ways, then Advanced Renamer is your ideal choice. If you find the display intimidating, you can always refer to the online documentation.
