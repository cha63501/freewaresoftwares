**Publisher's Description**  
  

FlashFolder extends the file-related common dialogs (e.g. open/save dialog)
seen in most Windows programs. A small toolbar docks onto these dialogs that
provides menus for quick access to recently-used folders, favorite folders and
more.

**Features:**

  * menu of recently used folders 
  * editable menu of favorite folders 
  * enlarges the dialogs to a configurable size (even non-resizable file dialogs of many programs) 
  * automatically positions the dialogs at the center of the main program window or at the center of the screen 
  * enlarges the directory- and file type drop-down fields so less scrolling is needed for them 
  * show the full path of the folder whoAs content is currently displayed 
  * quickly view Aall filesA (set *.* filter) 
  * Total CommanderA(r) directory menu can be displayed instead of FlashFolders own favorites 
The following dialogs are currently supported:

  * common AOpen/SaveA dialog (Windows 2000 / XP) 
  * MS Office 2003 AOpen/SaveA dialog (requires Windows XP for full functionality) 
  * common ABrowse for folderA dialog (Windows 2000 / XP) 
  * AOpen WithA dialog (Windows 2000) 
The Aopen withA dialog is an exception in that it does not host the
FlashFolder toolbar. FlashFolder only enlarges this dialog (even makes it
resizable) and repositions it according to what is set in the options dialog.
