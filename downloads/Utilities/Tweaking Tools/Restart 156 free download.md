Restart is a system utility for advanced users with more than one operating
system installed on their machine. The program installs an icon in the

restart with the selected operating system. The program also includes commands
to shutdown the computer in different ways (including stand-by and hibernate),
a schedule function, and advanced settings for uncommon configurations.

Please note: this program works in conjunction with the Microsoft boot
manager, and it is not compatible with other third-party products.
