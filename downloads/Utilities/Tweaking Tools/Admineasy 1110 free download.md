**Publisher's Description**  
  

The program is very helpful for system administrators. You can manage many
system settings and restrictions. Enable right click, hide drives, disable LAN
settings changes, and disable registry tools. Set general settings like no
recent docs history, clear page file on exit, no Windows update, etc. The
utility can also be used to check whether you are restricted or not via the
check box which extracts the already set restrictions.
