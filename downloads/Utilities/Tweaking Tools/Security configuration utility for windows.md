**Publisher's Description**  
  


Seconfig XP can **configure** Windows not to use TCP/IP as transport protocol for NetBIOS, SMB and RPC, thus leaving TCP/UDP **ports 135, 137-139 and 445** (the most exploited Windows networking weak point) **closed**. This tool works only with Windows registry (it doesnA't install any files/drivers etc.). 

Seconfig XP can also configure other hidden security related Windows TCP/IP settings and disable some insecure and mostly unneeded services.

For additional safety Seconfig XP backs up every changed setting, allowing user to restore all settings to their original values.
