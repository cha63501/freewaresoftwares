**Publisher's Description**  
  


MultiRes works very much like a 32-bit version of the venerable Microsoft QuickRes 16-bit applet for Windows 95, with administrative scripting facilities and extended capabilities to handle refresh rates and multiple monitors. 

Supported resolution and refresh rates are accessible from the command-line or from a simple menu that pops up from the system tray. An optional timed confirmation prompt A enabled by default in the program About box A ensures that any changes you make can be reversed safely, without fuss.

While MultiRes - unlike EnTechAs PowerStrip - does not allow you to define new display settings, it does give you quick and easy access to the ones the driver makes available A in a simple, compact and conservative package.
