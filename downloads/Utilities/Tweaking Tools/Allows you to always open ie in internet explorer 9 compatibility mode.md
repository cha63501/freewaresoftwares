**Publisher's Description**  
  


IE9 Compatibility Mode Enabler. This program adds a registry entry onto your machine that tells Internet Explorer to always open in Internet Explorer 9 compatibility mode. 

This is not the same function as you can use by pressing F12 and changing the compatibility mode in there, this is a much stronger method of forcing Internet Explorer 10 and 11 into a more stable Internet Explorer 9 environment. 

We have had a lot of success with this program in using it to fix IE10 and IE11 issues with websites, custom built programs and also the Shoretel administration web interface.
