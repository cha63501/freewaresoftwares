**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you ever faced a situation where you have waited for a program to
complete and had the feeling the program may have crashed? WouldnA't it be
nice if you could always see if your CPU is really working? Well, you could
have the task manager window in front, but how about a program that doesnA't
waste valuable screen space?

CPUUsage System Service is a freeware application which will show the cpu load
in the systray as an icon. ItA's very easy to use and utilizes minimal
resources.

CpuUsage installs itself as a system service and loads automatically when
Windows starts. If you want to use it only when required, you can disable the
loading in the tray icon menu.
