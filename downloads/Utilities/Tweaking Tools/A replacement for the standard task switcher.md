**Publisher's Description**  
  


WinSwitch is a replacement for the standard Windows task switcher dialog (Alt+Tab), which has remained virtually unchanged since Windows 95. It provides the same functionality, but also enhances it by displaying a small screenshot of the application in addition to the associated icon. It requires no installation and can be placed anywhere.
