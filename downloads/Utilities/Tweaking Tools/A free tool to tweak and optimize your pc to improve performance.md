Like most PC users and gamers in particular, it is likey that you would like to boost computer performance to get the best experience, particularly when you are playing memory-hungry games. While you can tweak your PC on your own to improve its performance, this is not only time consuming but also requires a high level of knowledge about how computers work. With Wise Game Booster, however, you can easily optimize your system even if you are a novice. 

Wise Game Booster is a handy PC optimizer you can use to speed up the performance of your PC, which is important when you want to get the best video gaming experience. The application is suitable for both novices and advanced users because it makes it easy to optimize system configuration.

**Features**

**One-Click Optimization:** The program has an AOptimize AllA button that can automatically close unnecessary Windows services, stop background processes and optimize PC when clicked.

**System Optimization:** The system optimizer is specifically designed for the game environment.

**Manual optimization suggestions:** There are sections that allow users to stop services or end processes manually. Although these functions require advanced knowledge, the program offers useful suggestions to prevent system corruption.

**My Games:** Provides the ability to add favorite games to make them easier to find.

**Service Resume:** Stopping some services may interfere with performance, and this function allows users to restore previous states.

**Using Wise Game Optimizer**

Wise Game Optimizer has a friendly user interface divided into several panels for easy access to its various features. The first area allowed us to set the program to automatically search for the games installed on our system and submit them for analysis.

We got different details about our games, including file name, type of game, game developer, last run, run times, notes and rating.

The program is divided into three main sections:

  * Services issues: Finds services that are not related to what you are doing and stops them. 
  * Program issues: Finds programs that weigh heavily on RAM and CPU resources. 
  * System issues: Tweaks Windows registry to increase speed. 

The program allowed us to run Windows Explorer as a separate process, which helped in avoiding system conflicts. You can also use the program to terminate services and processes that are currently active.

**Pros**

  * Lightweight and fast 
  * Easy to use 
  * Automates optimization 

**Cons**

  * Some tweaks do not seem to have any significant impact 

Wise Game Booster responds fast and applies required changes quickly. The PC optimizer uses relatively low system resources.
