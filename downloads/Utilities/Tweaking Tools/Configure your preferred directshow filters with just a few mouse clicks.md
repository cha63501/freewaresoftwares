**Publisher's Description**  
  


Windows 7 uses its own DirectShow filters for decoding several audio and video formats. Using third party filters instead of the native filters is not possible without making changes to the Windows Registry. 

This tool allows you to configure your preferred DirectShow filters with just a few mouse clicks. It is quick, easy, and changes can be always undone.

If you for example prefer to use ffdshow or CoreAVC for decoding H.264 video then you can do so by using this tool.

This tool is particularly useful for the Microsoft players, such as Windows Media Player and Media Center. Certain advanced third party players, such as Media Player Classic, are capable of using third party filters without the need for this tool.

**Important Note**

The changes made by this tool only have effect when a player uses DirectShow.

Windows Media Player and Media Center use Media Foundation instead of DirectShow for playing certain file formats. In that case they will use the Microsoft decoders. Examples of file formats that are played using Media Foundation are: .m2ts, .mp4, and .mov.

**This tool can set the preferred filter for the following video formats.**

  * H.264 
  * MPEG-4 (Xvid/DivX/MP4V) 
  * MPEG-2 
  * VC-1 and WMVA 
  * WMV1/2/3 
  * AAC 
  * MP3 
  * MP2
