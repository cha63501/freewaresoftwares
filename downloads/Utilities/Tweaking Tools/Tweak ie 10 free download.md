**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tweak IE is a freeware tweaker for Internet Explorer. Tweak IE lets you tweak
and customize the Internet Explorer UI to suit your requirements, easily from
one interface.

This Internet Explorer tweaker includes Toolbar tweaks, Control Panel
settings, Group Policy restrictions and other miscellaneous settings. This IE
tweaker has a number of tweaks that will help you to enable/disable options
easily, without opening the registry editor.

It is always a good idea to create a System Restore Point first, before
applying any tweaks. Should you wish, you can also always use the Restore
Defaults button to reset all settings to IE defaults.
