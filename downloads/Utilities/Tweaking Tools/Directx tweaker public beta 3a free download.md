**Publisher's Description**  
  

The DirectX Tweaker is a tool that acts like an interface between DirectX
and/or Direct 3D and the program that originally uses the Direct 3D
interfaces.

This allows to change or log all actions of the Direct 3D interface. At
present, this functionality is given for DirectX 8 API and DirectX 9 API.

The DirectX Tweaker serves as a host for many different plug-ins, which
provide different functions each. With this kind of modular approach it is
very easy to design special modules to interact with Direct 3D.
