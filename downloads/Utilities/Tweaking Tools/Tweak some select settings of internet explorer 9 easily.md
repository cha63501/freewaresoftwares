**Publisher's Description**  
  


IE9 Tweaker lets you tweak some select settings of Internet Explorer 9 easily. While our Tweak IE lets you tweak and customize the Internet Explorer UI to suit your requirements, easily from one interface, IE9 Tweaker lets you do more on IE9. 

IE9 Tweaker lets you tweak the following settings in Internet Explorer 9:

  * Set menu bar to be always visible 
  * Set menu bar on top 
  * Set InPrivate Filtering to be always on 
  * Set 3D Border. Allowing the 3D Border will add a border between the toolbar and the web window. 
  * Always start IE in full-screen 
  * Set small icons on toolbar 
  * Change number of maximum downloads 
  * Change the rows on the about:tabs page. You can set this figure between 2 -5. Internet Explorer 9 shows 2 rows of your oft-visited sites on the about:tabs page, with each row having 5 thumbnails. We have already blogged on how you can make IE9 show more rows in the about:tabs page manually. 
  * Create a custom Favorites Home Page to make it display your favorites. 
The main feature of IE9 Tweaker is the ability to create your own customized Homepage similar to IE9 About:Tabs page.
