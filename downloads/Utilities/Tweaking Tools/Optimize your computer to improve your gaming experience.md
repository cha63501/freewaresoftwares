Are you sometimes frustrated by the way some games run on your computer? For example, do you need to lower your game settings to play some games? Then you should consider Razer Game Booster. This PC optimizer shuts down system processes and services that are not associated with the resource-hungry game you are playing. You will no longer have to bother about knowing the best game configurations because you will enjoy your games the way they are designed to be played. 

**Features**

**Boost Computer Performance:** Razer Game Booster temporarily shuts down unnecessary applications and functions to release PC resources to the game played. This helps to maximize frames per second.

**Maintain PC:** The program enables users to update outdated drivers, defragment game directories and make other tweaks. The "Tweak" tool automatically analyzes the computer and enhances configurations for the best performance.

**Take Screenshots and Videos:** Razer Game Booster gives you the opportunity to record a video of your favorite game or take screenshots of sections you are interested in.

**Other functions include:**

  * Cleaning RAM 
  * Intensifying processor performance 
  * Downloading important gaming tools 
  * Updating hardware drivers 

**Using Razer Game Booster**

The basic user interface of Razer Game Booster gave us a list of 24 noncritical processes we could shut down when playing games. We could select specific processes we wanted the program to shut down.

We enjoyed the one-click function of the PC optimizer. Shutting down unwanted functions required just a single mouse click. It also allowed us to upgrade outdated drivers by clicking on the "Drivers" tab. The program scanned our system quickly and showed us the components we needed to update.

The "Gallery" feature allowed us to hone our creative skills by recording realtime video and audio. You can use this handy feature to perform different things, including creating tutorials. You can even share your best gaming moments with your friends.

We set up the keys we wanted to use to record videos and take screenshots, which were of high quality. We gave our games a new lease on life by defragmenting their directories so they could run faster.

**Pros**

  * Sleek design 
  * Simple user interface 
  * Fast boosting and unboosting of games 
  * Extra features 

**Cons**

  * Slow start-up 
  * Selecting processes to shut down requires good computer knowledge 

Razer Game Booster is a powerful PC optimizer that helps to boost computer performance for better gameplay. There was a marked improvement when we played games using the programAs "Game Mode". It is especially ideal for laptop systems.
