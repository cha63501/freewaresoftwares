**Publisher's Description**  
  

Microsoft VirtualWiFi is a virtualization architecture for wireless LAN (WLAN)
cards. It abstracts a single WLAN card to appear as multiple virtual WLAN
cards to the user. The user can then configure each virtual card to connect to
a different wireless network. Therefore, it allows a user to simultaneously
connect his machine to multiple wireless networks using just one WLAN card.
This new functionality introduced by VirtualWiFi enables many new
applications, which were not possible earlier using a single WLAN card.
