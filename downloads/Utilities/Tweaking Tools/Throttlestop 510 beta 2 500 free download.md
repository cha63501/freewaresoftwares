**Publisher's Description**  
  

ThrottleStop is a small application designed to monitor for and correct the 3
main types of CPU throttling that are being used on many Intel based laptop
computers. The left side of ThrottleStop contains a variety of options which
can be used to bypass CPU throttling and on the right side is a Monitoring
panel that shows you the current state of each thread on your CPU.

Some laptops are using clock modulation and multiplier reductions to lower the
performance and power consumption of your computer. This is done deliberately
to either allow your computer to run cooler or to allow your laptop to operate
with a power adapter that is not sufficient to fully power your laptop and
recharge its battery at the same time.

When using ThrottleStop, it is strongly recommended to monitor power
consumption at the wall with a Kill-a-Watt meter or similar device and make
sure that you donA't exceed the power capabilities of your power adapter. Use
of ThrottleStop to bypass these throttling schemes is at your own risk and can
result in permanent damage to your power adapter or computer or both which may
not be covered by your warranty.

**Note:** Only works with Intel based CPUs.
