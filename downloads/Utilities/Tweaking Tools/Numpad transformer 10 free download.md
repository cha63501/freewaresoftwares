**Publisher's Description**  
  

NumPad Transformer will let you arm your NumPad with frequently used
functions, including basic mouse control. The program changes two more buttons
besides those included in the NumPad -- the ScrollLock and the Pause/Break
buttons.

ScrollLock becomes a "Copy" button, and Pause/Break becomes a "Paste" button.
The Division button (/) becomes "Ctrl+Tab". The Multiplication button (*)
becomes "Ctrl+F4". The Subtraction button (-) will give the "Restore" command.

NumPad keys from Home (top left) to Page Down (bottom right) will now move
your mouse. Pressing the same buttons while holding the Shift key will give
temporarily more speed to mouse movement. The Insert button will perform a
left mouse click and the Clear button at the middle of the NumPad will perform
a right click. The Addition button (+) will let you navigate all your (non-
minimized) open windows one by one. The Enter button of the NumPad will now
"Minimize" a window to the taskbar.

Finally pressing just a single button, the Delete key of the NumPad, will let
you immediately Shutdown, Restart, Log Off or send your monitor to Sleep!
