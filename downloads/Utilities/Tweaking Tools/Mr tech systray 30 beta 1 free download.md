**Publisher's Description**  
  

MR Tech Systray is a swiss army knife of tools, tweaks and system options. It
will not only let you quickly shut down, restart or log off from Windows, it
can help keep your hard disk a little cleaner, organize your MP3 & Other Media
files, edit MP3A's iD3 tags, sort text lines, log reboots and tune your
system. Other features include: system-wide shortcut keys, an incredibly fast
program uninstaller, a directory jump list, enhanced system information, save
or print screenshot/window and more.

The primary functionality is the fact that it runs quietly in the system tray
and allows you to run it by either left or right-clicking on the icon. Left
clicking will open up the main windows containing several pieces of system
information as well as a plethora of tools, tweaks and options. Many options
are available quickly via right-click menu in your systray. And there are also
several system-wide keyboard shortcuts that are created on startup.
