**Publisher's Description**  
  

ClearTweakA allows you to change the contrast setting of the ClearTypeA(r)
setting for Windows XPA(r).

ClearType is designed to enhance LCD displays. It may appear slightly blurry
on standard desktop monitors. It does not hurt to try ClearTweakA on a CRT
monitor. Even though ClearTypeA is designed for LCDA's, some people see an
improvement on CRTA's.
