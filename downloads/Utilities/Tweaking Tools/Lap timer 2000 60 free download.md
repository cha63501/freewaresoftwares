**Publisher's Description**  
  

LapTimer 2000 is a small MS Windows program that will count and time laps on
any scale slot car track. Laps are timed with 1/1000 of a second accuracy.

Lap Timer 2000 includes hardware interfaces for the Joystick Game Pad,
Parallel Printer Port, Keyboard and the RS-232 Serial Communications Port.
Slot car tracks with up to four lanes can be used with Lap Timer 2000. A
single race or practice session can record up to 4096 laps per lane.

The current lap time for each lane is displayed using a large 90 point font to
facilitate easy viewing from across a room. The current lap time displayed for
each lane is updated each time a slot car passes over the lap counter track.
The current lap number will also be updated when a slot car passes over the
lap counter.

Races can be run for a specified length of time or until a preset number of
laps have been completed. Races can be paused and resumed when track calls and
red flag conditions dictate. A race summary file is created when a race is
completed. This race summary file can be viewed or printed. The race summary
includes the number of laps completed as well as individual lap times for each
competitor.
