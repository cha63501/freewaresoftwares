**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tweak FX is a powerful, plugin-based configuration tool for Windows. Allows
you to change the settings into the Windows system registry. It uses plugins
written in VBScript.

ItA's highly customizeable through the implemented IE engine -- supports
native IE features: HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, JScipt, VBScript, ActiveX, etc.

In contrast to hundreds of so called A'tweakersA', TweakFX uses plugins, that
can extend its possibilites to a significant range. All plugins are simple
XHTML pages and you can modify them to meet your needs.

Since Internet Explorer provides Web pages with such great functions like
scripting languages, usage of ActiveX controls, Cascading Style Sheets, you
name it..., TweakFX turns into the ultimate, super-duper configuration tool
for the operating environment.
