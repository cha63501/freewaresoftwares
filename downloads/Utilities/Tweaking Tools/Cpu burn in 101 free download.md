**Publisher's Description**  
  

CPU Burn-in is a stability testing tool for overclockers. The program heats up
any x86 CPU to the maximum possible operating temperature that is achievable
by using ordinary software. This allows the user to adjust the CPU speed up to
the practical maximum while still being sure that stability is achieved even
under the most stressful conditions. The program continuously monitors for
erroneous calculations and errors ensuring the CPU does not generate errors
during calculations performed under overclocking conditions.
