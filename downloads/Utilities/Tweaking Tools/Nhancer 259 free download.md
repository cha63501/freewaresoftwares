**Publisher's Description**  
  

nHancer is a tool to improve the usage of nVidiaA's own control panel. Both
normal and advanced users should find nHancer to be a big step forward.

Additionally, nVidia drivers include a unique feature, that allows them to
define profiles for every game, which control various image quality,
compatibility and optimization aspects. But in the standard control panel,
this feature is even more cryptic to use, so most people never bothered about
it.

nHancer is a powerful and handy utility that improves the handling of profiles
by adding many features that the normal control panel doesnA't offer at all
and improving the ones that it does offer.

Lately, this feature has received some new attention, since the new SLI
technique requires nVidia to provide such a profile for a game to get any
speed improvement. But these profiles are just as interesting even without
SLI, just to enhance the gaming experience with any game.

**Features:**

  * Support of Forceware 60 and later, including the new 100+ versions 
  * Support of all GeForce cards, including the new GeForce 8x00 line 
  * Supports Windows Vista 
  * Support for single card, SLI and Quad-SLI systems 
  * On-the-fly control of all global quality and performance-enhancing settings for all games 
  * Create and manage fully automated profiles for all your games 
  * Very easy to use, explains all options and their effects, like Anti Aliasing, Anisotropic Filtering, etc. 
  * Special options for nVidiaA's SLI feature, allowing you to to use almost every game with SLI even if nVidia doesnA't support it 
  * Offers additional Anti Aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering modes, that are not available through nVidiaA's control panel 
  * Flexible user interface: change the size of the window and all sub areas 
  * User interface and help texts available in various languages (right now English, German, Polish and Spanish) 
  * Coexists perfectly with nVidiaA's own control panel and other tools, like aTuner or RivaTuner. nHancer will immediately detect any changes made by any other tool. 

**Requirements:**

  * Any nVidia GeForce graphic card 
  * Forceware driver version 60 or higher 
  * [MS .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html)
