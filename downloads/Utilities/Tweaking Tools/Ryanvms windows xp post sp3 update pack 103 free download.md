**Publisher's Description**  
  

This pack is designed to bring a Windows XP CD with SP3 integrated fully up to
date with all of the latest hotfixes released by Microsoft since SP2A's
release. It accomplishes this task via direct integration, where files on the
CD are directly overwritten by the updated files. This method has numerous
advantages over other integration techniques:

  * Since the files are being directly overwritten on the CD, there is no period of vulnerability between when the files are copied to the hard drive and the hotfixes are run. This guarantees maximum stability and security. 
  * All necessary registry entries needed by Windows Update, QFECheck, and Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer are imported during Windows setup, meaning that the integration is transparent to Windows. 
  * Security Catalogs necessary for Windows File Protection to recognize the updated files as digitally signed are installed, once again ensuring maximum transparency to Windows. 
  * Since the updated files are being directly overwritten on the CD, this pack has the minimum possible amount of overhead associated with integrating hotfixes in comparison to other methods - both in space used on the CD and in Windows installation time. 
  * This pack works regardless of whether or not the Windows installation is unattended.
