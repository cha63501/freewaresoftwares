**Publisher's Description**  
  

7plus is a free open-source program which aspires to make working with Windows
as comfortable as possible. The feature set it adds to Windows ranges from
interface extensions to the explorer to highly specialized solutions for all
common tasks, with the goal of reducing the work load for the user. This
feature-rich system, powered by Autohotkey, provides very powerful
configuration capabilities to suit the needs you have and those that you have
but not know of yet!

Here is a small compilation of use cases where 7plus can greatly enhance your
workflow*:

  * doubleclick on the desktop to create a folder

  * type with the keyboard to run programs, switch windows, etc. 
  * use hotkeys to launch programs 
  * navigate to folders using hotkeys or buttons in the explorer bar! 

[*]: Assuming those examples fit your workflow. You can just as well make
7plus do something completely different.

To everyone who notices that something else doesnA't work when 7plus runs:
Make sure there is no interference with other programs, such as keyboard or
mouse drivers, or other tweaking utitlities!
