**Publisher's Description**  
  

When running a restricted user account with fast user switching under Windows
XP, some games will not start correctly. The game requests that the original
disk be placed in the drive, even if it is already present. To remedy this
issue, download and run this fix.

This software will change the startup state of the system component needed to
start your game from start on demand (on game load), to start at boot (on
Windows XP start).
