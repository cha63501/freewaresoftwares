**Publisher's Description**  
  

Intel Desktop Control Center enables you to perform stress tests to verify
system stability and to conduct performance testing to measure the impact of
system configuration changes. The easy-to-read system gauges provide feedback
so you can observe the effects of various system modifications in real-time.

This easy-to-use console dynamically displays temperatures, speed, and usage
percentages, allowing you to verify system stability and check performance
gains without rebooting into the BIOS. And once you have tuned the system to
your liking, the settings can be stored as presets so you can quicly shift
gears between "quiet operation" and "gaming mode".
