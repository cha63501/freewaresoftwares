**Publisher's Description**  
  

0A80070005 FIX will simply attempt to repair the dreaded 0A80070005 error
messages when trying to register dll files while installing certain Windows
components or programs.

Sometimes you will not get this specific error number, but just an
Installation Failed message. This tool will in most cases also repair these
errors, for example: Internet Explorer 7 installation failure. It will
accomplish repairing these errors by restoring your computer to the original
installation default security settings.

Because restoring your security settings to its defaults canAt be undone,
0A80070005 FIX will automatically create a System Restore Point for you.

**Installation:**  
0A80070005 FIX is fully portable, meaning that it requires no installation and
can be run directly from a USB flash disk. It also writes absolutely no
settings to the Registry or the userAs folder. It is a very simple utility
and, for this reason, does not demand any installation utility. Simply unzip
all files to any folder and run the executable file (usually, 0A80070005.exe).

**Note:** If you do not have any 0A80070005 errors or Installation problems, do not run this tool, it will be unnecessary.
