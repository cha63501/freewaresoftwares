**Publisher's Description**  
  


The search bar in IE 7 can be convenient. You can customize it to use any search engine you want. Even your own home brew search engine if you want. 

It can get really annoying if you already have search software installed from Google, or Yahoo. Who wants two search bars when you only need the one you want?

Microsoft never put an option in the settings for IE 7 to disable or remove the search bar, but this tool will do it.
