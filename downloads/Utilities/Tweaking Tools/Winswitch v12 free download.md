**Publisher's Description**  
  

WinSwitch is a replacement for the standard Windows task switcher dialog
(Alt+Tab), which has remained virtually unchanged since Windows 95. It
provides the same functionality, but also enhances it by displaying a small
screenshot of the application in addition to the associated icon. It requires
no installation and can be placed anywhere.
