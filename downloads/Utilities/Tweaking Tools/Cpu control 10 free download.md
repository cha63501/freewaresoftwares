**Publisher's Description**  
  

CPU-Control handles the CPU-affinity for multicore-systems. Instead of running
each process on both CPUs you can define it as you want it. For example, if
you want to seperate the firewall and the anti-virus-software from the
graphics-application.

CPU-Controls offers five different ways to control the CPU-affinity:

  * Automatic: It chooses alternatingly one CPU for each new process 
  * Manual: You define a list, where you can set the way to handle each process 
  * All processes run on CPU 1, which is useful for old applications which crashes on a dual core system 
  * All processes run on CPU 2 
  * Deactivated
