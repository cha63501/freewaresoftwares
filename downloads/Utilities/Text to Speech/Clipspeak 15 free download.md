**Publisher's Description**  
  

ClipSpeak is a portable, lightweight text-to-speech tool that speaks text
copied to the clipboard. It can also be used to save texts to MP3 files for
easy transfer to compatible MP3 players.

ClipSpeak requires the [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-
Framework-x-Final_program_16026.html) or later to run.

**Technical Details:**  
ClipSpeak is targeting the .NET Framework version 2.0, and is written in C#
using Visual Studio 2008. It uses the Microsoft Speech Object Library for
speech output, which means it cannot use all synthesizers available. ClipSpeak
does not store any information in the registry, nor anywhere else on disk,
meaning it is fully portable. For MP3 compression it uses the LAME MP3
library.

Tracker on the CodePlex page.
