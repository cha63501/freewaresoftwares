**Publisher's Description**  
  

The A A S Application Access Server makes the PC administration possible over
LAN and WANs. He is the right choice to start programs, stop services, manage
processes, deinstall software or simply report system information over the
internet.

With its "Stealth Mode" it makes the pc administration possible, without the
port scanner noticing the host service. The control is carried out over a
built-in HTML server. All you need is an HTML browser on the client side.

A-A-S reacts very sensitively to attacks from the Internet. Every attack has
the consequence that the attacker is put on a "black list" and they never gain
access even if they use the right password.

Highlights:

  * Integrated HTML server 
  * Control over a standard browser 
  * Support DynDNS 
  * Show eventlog 
  * Wake On LAN 
  * Start from defined applications. 
  * Advertisements of system information 
  * Software management 
  * Manage your system tasks and services 
  * Set user restriction for each feature of the A-A-S 
  * With the "Stealth Mode" the A-A-S is hidden for all kind of port scanners. 
  * A access cotrol list enables, that only registered computers can be login. 
  * Detailed logs support the administrator about attacker localizing
