**Publisher's Description**  
  


Snare for Lotus Notes provides a remote distribution, and configuration checking tool for the Lotus Notes application, interfacing with the underlying Notes "log.nsf" file, and user/group and access control application programming interfaces. Snare for Notes can send data to either a syslog server, or the Snare Server for analysis and storage. 

The Lotus Notes application writes log data to a variety of A'notesA' within the A'log.nsfA' database. Snare for Lotus Notes regularly polls these notes, pulls the data out of the database, and then forwards the data to a local or remote syslog server, or a remote Snare Server, allowing security administrators to implement a centralised audit collection, analysis and archive facility with minimal audit client resource utilisation.

Snare for Lotus Notes is available under the terms of the GNU Public License.
