**Publisher's Description**  
  

SDTConnector provides a simplified way to tunnel various TCP and UDP based
network services (such as RDP, VNC, HTTP and Telnet) through SSH.

The goal of the sdtcon project is to provide simple point and click secure
remote and out of band access to systems and devices inside a private LAN or
management network.

sdtcon is a multi-platform application written in Java. It utilizes the Java
Secure Channel (JSch) implementation of SSH2 to create SSH redirections (aka
SSH tunnels) into the private network through the public Internet via an SSH
gateway, as illustrated in this network diagram. A client on the local host is
automatically connected to the remote host through the secure tunnel, often
using an otherwise insecure protocol such as Telnet or VNC.

Uniquely, sdtcon has overcome a traditional limitation of SSH2 and allows you
to tunnel UDP based protocols (such as DNS or Serial over LAN). Another unique
feature is sdtconA's ability to facilitate out-of-band access to your remote
hosts should the primary path to your SSH gateway be unavailable or
unreliable.

**Features:**

  * sdtcon interoperates with any SSH2-compliant gateway, including machines running OpenSSH, and OpengearA's secure device and console servers 
  * Strong encryption and authentication using JSch SSH2 implementation 
  * Public key and password authentication to the SSH gateway 
  * Tunnels UDP based services, previously a limitation of SSH2 
  * Facilitates out-of-band access to the SSH gateway 
  * No limit of the number of gateways, hosts or services that can be configured 
  * No artificial limit on the number of hosts that can be accessed concurrently 
  * Very simple to configure and easy to use 
  * Runs on any machine running any graphical OS (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X) with the Java runtime environment (JRE) 1.4.2 or later installed 
  * sdtcon is and shall remain free, open source software, distributed under the GPL 

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
