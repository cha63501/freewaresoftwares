**Publisher's Description**  
  

InstantVNC is a secure remote-support tool based on Ultr@VNC. With it, a
Windows PC can be remotely accessed regardless of firewall, router or web-
proxy configuration. InstantVNC combines the open-source echoWare DLL directly
into a feature-rich VNC Server to create the easiest-to-use, zero-install,
"firewall-friendly" remote-support platform available.

**Features:**

  * Zero-install, zero-config, "single-click" firewall-friendly remote support & file-transfer server based on VNC. 
  * Easily customizable: just startup while holding down the SHIFT key. 
  * With the 1.36 release, customizable desktop icon as well as splash screen. 
  * A "dynamic-DNS" capability for VNC Servers without static IP addresses 
  * End-to-end data security with OpenSSLA's 128-bit AES encryption 
  * Support for HTTP, SOCKS and ISA/NTLM web-proxies 
  * Improved support for Windows Vista, with and without UAC controls.
