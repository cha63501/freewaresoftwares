**Publisher's Description**  
  

Qunetix SD is a software deployment platform for heterogeneous networks,
allowing you to install or update software on your network systems without
formal training. Using an automated and managed process, Qunetix SD manages
the packaging, testing and deployment of any release. Designed as a standalone
distribution tool, Qunetix SD uses the principles of software configuration
management (SCM) and will also augment source and build management tools to
provide managed distributions.

Qunetix SD features include: guaranteed confirmation of all releases; release
scheduling; impact analysis; a secure release repository; guaranteed
reproducibility of any release; automatic distribution and installation; audit
trail; user roles and management; and secure communications that encrypt and
authenticate every deployment.

Qunetix SD Lite is also available for companies who require managed software
deployment without the advanced management functionality in 2.0. The Free
Version download has a perpetual license to use and/or evaluate the tool. This
version contains the full functionality of Qunetix SD 2.0, but is limited to 4
targets. Additional targets can be purchased from $30 US each.
