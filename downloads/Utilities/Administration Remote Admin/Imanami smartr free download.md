**Publisher's Description**  
  

Find out whatA's in your directory fast using Imanami SmartR. Reports have
never been easier to produce than with SmartR, which allows you to view or
print accurate reports on objects within your directory or Global Address List
(GAL).

Out-of-the-box SmartR contains canned reports every administrator cannot live
without. SmartR is wizard based, simplifying your experience. Once you
complete the wizard, SmartR gathers the information from the Exchange server
or Active Directory domain controller and writes the results to an XML file.
SmartR then automatically transforms the XML results into the format you
requested using an XSL stylesheet. SmartR reports are defined in an XML
format, which enables you to customize or even create any report you need
using your favorite text editor.
