**Publisher's Description**  
  


This sleek, lightweight gadget will sit quietly in the Windows Sidebar, notifying you of all incoming calls, text messages (which you can respond to), allowing you to send any file, and locating your mobile device. 

So far, the gadget works with Windows Mobile and Android devices with many more in the pipeline (Blackberry, Palm Pre, and a robust laptop client). For those looking for an OS agnostic backup/recovery/security solution, this is the answer.
