**Publisher's Description**  
  


Remote machine access for files, registry, processes, services. All commands are scriptable. A script may be run to change remote machines or read the system values. Full control of process and services. Kill, Launch, Stop, Start, and remotely reboot. Modify service binary locations that Windows does not allow, kill process that task manager will not, full graphical registry control similiar to regedit, Drag and drop Replication allows you to drop a file to many machines in a single mouse operation. Security is of heavy focus. All data that moves over the network is both encrypted and compressed, the transactions are sequenced so record and playback attacks are not possible, and connection hijacking cannot be done. 

The connection model is peer to peer and allows for routing of connections, for example FTP only allows file access to a single machine, fileXfer allows you to reach any machine on the network and the machines do not need to be directly on the internet if they can contact an other machine that is, much like an HTTP proxy but for complete machine control not just HTML content. Freeware, no nag screens, never expires, no ads, not crippled. 

Supports 10 connections and 3 proxy routes to reach other machines deeper in the network. The server is only 316kb and may run as a Windows service (NT,2K,XP) or run in the windows tray next to the clock on your Start bar in (95 98 ME NT 2K XP). Very Stable first released in early 2002 used for all web server administration at United Business Technologies and to reach machines that were not reachable prior to new TCP routing technology released and explained in detail on the home page.
