**Publisher's Description**  
  

The NTToolkit is a set of small and useful utilities designed to help network
administrators with their daily administrative tasks. The NTToolkit is
freeware and constantly enhanced.

**Password Assistant** is a GUI application that lets you update passwords of user accounts on multiple Windows NT, Windows 2000 or Windows XP machines. A good example is updating the Administrator password on all of your networks workstations.

You can obtain computer names to update from the network neighbourhood (with a
filter option) or from a text file. The update process can also be logged to a
text file.

**NetSend** is an application with a graphical user interface that allows you to send a text message to a remote Windows NT, Windows 2000 or Windows XP computer that is running the Messenger service (activated by default).

**Hardlink Shell Extension** is an extension to the Windows shell. It allows you to create hardlinks from within the explorer shell by right-clicking any file.

**ServiceSecure** allows you to easily reset service passwords by specifying the username and password rather than having to manually configure services through the MMC. Changing the password of a user account used by services is no longer a nightmare, simply use ServiceSecure in a batch file and update all affected services in your entire network in a matter of moments.

**TaskSecure** allows you to easily manage the passwords stored in scheduled tasks on your network. Simply specify the username and password and TaskSecure will reset the password stored in all scheduled tasks (using the specified username) on the specified computer (local or remote). You can use it in a batch file to update all scheduled tasks on your networks in a matter of moments.

**Logoff Delay** lets you log off a user in a specified amount of time. This can be useful if you want to restrict the logon time of users.

**GetHTTP** is a command line application that allows you to retrieve files through the HTTP protocol. Please note that SSL is not supported.

**File Replace** is a command line utility that parses a directory (including subdirectories) and replaces multiple occurrances of one template file.

**Super Delete** is a command line utility that parses a directory (including subdirectories) and delete multiple occurrances of one file.

**CheckTCP** is an command line application that can determine whether a TCP port on a host is open. Additionally you can receive initial data sent from the remote host through an open TCP connection, such as when connecting to most SMTP hosts.

**CheckTCP** can be used to quickly determine whether a certain TCP port is open and optionally display any data sent by the remote host over the established connection. CheckTCP is not intended to be used as a portscanner and does not have good performance for such use.

**FPing** (Fast Ping) is a command line substitution to the traditional ping.exe utility which ships with Windows. While FPing only supports the most commonly used command-line parameters (less than ping.exe) it does perform the network checks significantly faster than the traditional ping utility.

**Sleep** is a command line application to pause input for a specified amount of time. This is mainly useful for batch files.
