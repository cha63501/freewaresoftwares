**Publisher's Description**  
  

Snare for Windows is a Windows compatible service that interacts with the
underlying Windows Eventlog subsystem to facilitate remote, real-time transfer
of event log information.

Event logs from the Security, Application and System logs, as well as the new
DNS, File Replication Service, and Active Directory logs are supported. Log
data is converted to text format, and delivered to a remote Snare Server, or
to a remote SYSLOG server.

SNARE for Windows is free software, released under the terms of the GNU Public
Licence.
