**Publisher's Description**  
  


A utility that lets you reset the lockout count for local users and domain users. 

On Windows domains and workstations, it is possible to set an "Account lockout threshold", which determines the number of failed logon attempts that will cause a user account to be locked out. A locked out account cannot be used until it is reset by an administrator or the account lockout duration has expired.

With Lockout Resetter, an administrator can easily reset any locked out account.

Lockout Resetter automatically lists locked out users on a particular domain controller or on the local computer (leave the "Server" entry blank), enabling you to easily spot and select the user whose lockout count you want to reset.
