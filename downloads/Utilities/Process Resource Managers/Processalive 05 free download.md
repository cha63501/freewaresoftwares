**Publisher's Description**  
  

ProcessAlive is a simple tool that automatically restarts selected processes
when it detects that they have stopped. ItAs useful if you have a background
program that occasionally crashes or wish to run the same program repeatedly.
Ensuring that critical processes do not become unavailable can also be
accomplished with this tool. This is especially useful if you are running a
game/web server.

**Advanced Information:**

  * When a process is re-spawned by ProcessAlive, it will inherit the permission granted to ProcessAlive. If you require that processes are launched with administrator rights, ProcessAlive must be run as an administrator too. 
  * If the program you wish to preserve immediately calls a secondary executable then exits, ProcessAlive will cause an infinite loop and crash your system. Always make sure that you directly call x64 versions of executable files, rather than allow the x86 version to delegate. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).

**WhatA's New in version 0.5:**

  * Now closes properly from context menu.
