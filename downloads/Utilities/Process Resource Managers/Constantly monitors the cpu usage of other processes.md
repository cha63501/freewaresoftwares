**Publisher's Description**  
  


Process Tamer is a tiny and efficient utility that runs in your system tray and constantly monitors the CPU usage of other processes. When it sees a process that is overloading your CPU, it reduces the priority of that process temporarily until the usage returns to a reasonable level.
