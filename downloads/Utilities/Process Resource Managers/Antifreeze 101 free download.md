**Publisher's Description**  
  

AntiFreeze tries to offer an innovative solution to a very common problem
which has been experienced by nearly ever computer user: an unresponsive
system which is so busy with the running tasks that it is virtually hanging
and not usable anymore. AntiFreeze offers a last recourse when you find your
computer in a hung state.

Often in such a situation it may help you to press ALT+CTRL+DEL to start the
Windows task manager so you can kill the process which is consuming all
available resources. But if the system is so busy that it does not respond to
your mouse clicks and key presses then even the task manager may not be able
to help you. If you see no other solution than pressing the reset button,
AntiFreeze may help you out instead.

AntiFreeze will put to sleep all running programs except the most critical
ones, giving you the opportunity to close down the programs which are causing
problems. You may even be able to save or recover your work.
