**Publisher's Description**  
  


Process Controller is a system tray-based utility that lets you monitor and control the activity and resources of your system in real time. With it you can: 

  * See how much processing power and memory is currently being used in the system. 
  * Quit any application, assuming you have sufficient privileges. 
  * View the memory usage of each application. 
  * View the activity of each process and thread in real-time. 
  * View all windows created by each process. 

When run, Process Controller appears in the system tray showing two small meters. The left-hand meter shows the current processor utilisation; the right-hand meter shows the current memory load. You can change the colours used as well as opting to just display processor usage. On dual processor systems, the left-hand meter is split into two smaller meters showing processor load for each CPU.

Clicking the icon opens the main menu, from here you can access all of Process ControllerA's features, including a number of dynamic menus which display the memory utilization and processor usage of all running processes in real-time. Selecting a particular process will also give you the option of terminating it, or displaying its activity in a small window.
