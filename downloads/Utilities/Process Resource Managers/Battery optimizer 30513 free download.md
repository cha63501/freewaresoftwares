Battery Optimizer is designed to fix a problem that plagues most people, short
laptop battery life. Most other applications just help you manage when your
computer goes to sleep. Battery Optimizer goes several steps further and
actually tells you how much battery life you can save by turning un-needed
features of your laptop off. Giving you those extra minutes you need to save
that document or get to the next level in your game.

**WHY IS BATTERY OPTIMIZER DIFFERENT?**

Battery Optimizer is much more advanced than any other battery monitoring or
management application. Battery Optimizer actually tells you how much extra
battery life you can save by turning certain hardware and services off on your
laptop. You can then save those settings as a profile so that you can quickly
and easily optimize your setting for your current usage at any time.

Features that Battery Optimizer offers that no one else does:

  * Accurate estimates on how much battery life can be gained/lost by changing laptop settings
  * Advanced monitoring of battery usage over time
  * Shows time left on your battery when your operating system doesnA't
  * Easy battery usage management

Over time your laptop battery loses itA's maximum charge capacity, meaning it
wonA't last as long as it used to. You have three options when you get to this
point:

  1. Keep your laptop plugged into a power source
  2. Buy a new laptop battery
  3. Optimize your battery usage

With the reliance on being mobile these days you really cannot afford to be
stranded with no battery left on your laptop. Optimize your battery life with
Battery Optimizer!
