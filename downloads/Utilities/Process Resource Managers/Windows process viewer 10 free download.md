**Publisher's Description**  
  

Windows Process Viewer is a free program that will show you all the active
Windows processes running on your computer, in an easier to understand format
than the Windows Task Manager.

It displays the Windows file name, full folder path and file size for each
task. If you click a process, the file checker will connect to the File.net
online database for additional process information, including the real name of
the process and the name of the developer. You will also see the expected
default folder path. So you learn more about Windows processes running on a
computer or identify process in Task Manager.

Verify your startup system processes located in System32 folder like
svchost.exe (generic host process for win32 services), lsass.exe (Local
Security Authority Service), alg.exe (Application Layer Gateway Service),
ctfmon.exe, csrss.exe, wmiprvse.exe, wisptis.exe and wuauclt.exe.
