Yet Another (remote) Process Monitor (YAPM) is a powerful application that
allows to view and manage your running tasks, processes, threads, modules,
windows, handles, network connections and your services on a local or on a
remote machine.

YAPM offers lots of features to manipulate them, such as privilege management,
memory management, a complete history of statistics, a dependency viewer...
etc.

It is the first and only open source software to offer all these features.

ItA's totally free and open source (GNU GPL 3.0).

You are also able to monitor all Windows perfmon counters (local or remote
machine) with an advanced time scale. YAPM also can save advanced reports of
your system (HTML or TXT files).

YAPM offers an user-friendly GUI with Microsoft Office Ribbon style, or a
classical menu-based GUI if you donA't like the Ribbon style :-)
