**Publisher's Description**  
  


Systemometer is a unique monitoring tool that shows system activity and resources as a screen saver or a thumbnail window. It allows you to create different monitoring profiles out of the Windows performance counters available on your system or remote hosts. 

The interface displays the values of monitored parameters connecting all measured points in one polygon - a snapshot view that helps to read the overall system status at a glance. This method is also suitable for understanding load balance of a specific parameter (e.g. CPU utilization) among several items like computers or applications.

Different shapes of monitoring polygons draw visual patterns associated with normal or critical system states. One look at the screen will tell you what is happening with the system. The history of counter values can be recorded to the log file in either HTML or CSV format.

Systemometer Personal Edition is free for individual use on a single computer only. 

**What's New in version 1.6.2:**

  * Added control to visibility of current, average, and maximal values individually. 
  * Corrected displaying maximal line for inverted axis. 
  * Fixed window start-up to follow minimized, maximized, or normal mode specified in the shortcut properties.
