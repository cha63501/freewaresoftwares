**Publisher's Description**  
  


Wonder what is that unknown application working in your system? You donA't know what files it uses? TaskFiles gives you a full answer. It will show you a complete list of files and folders the program has opened for reading, modifying or getting information. 

Moreover, TaskFiles has a mode for advanced users that allows viewing named channels used by the process. To simplify the selection of a process we introduced two ways of sorting the process list: by process ID and alphabetically.

Want to get more details about files? You can save reports in the text format. If you want to find out what files and folders the system is using at the moment, you can select the process with ID 0, and the program will show a complete list of files for all applications. If you are not sure that a process is secure, you can stop the application.
