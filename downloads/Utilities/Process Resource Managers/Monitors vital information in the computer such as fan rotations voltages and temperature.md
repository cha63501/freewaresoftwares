**Publisher's Description**  
  


The ASUS PC Probe is a simple utility that monitors vital information in the computer such as fan rotations, voltages and temperature. You need to have an Asus motherboard on your system. 

Additionally, it gives system information such as hard disk space, memory usage, CPU type and processor speed.

After installation, the application resides in the taskbar and provides audio warning through the PC speakers if certain thresholds such as temperature and voltage have been exceeded. If your system is overclocked, remember to raise the appropriate warning limits or face frequent warning pop-ups.
