DTaskManager is a stand-alone Task-Manager specifically engineered to give
additional functionalities that the Windows bundled TaskManager does not have:

  * Three different way to close a process, as the "termination request", the "forced termination" and the "forced termination" of any type of process bypassing all permissions (it can terminate also system processes). 
  * DTaskManager will allow to suspend and reactivate a process (as in Linux), useful, for example, to temporarily suspend a task that uses system resources but you donA't want to terminate (as a DivX coding process). 
  * It allows to select more than one process at a time to terminate all of them and does not need any useless confirm. 
  * DTaskManager has port monitor capability (usefull to find virus and spyware). 
  * It allows to hide a window 

**WhatA's New in version 1.53:**

  * Improved TAB Ports, are now also listed specific services for each connection. 
  * Fixati various Bug that prevented the proper functioning in 64-bit OS to a variety of functions. 
  * Minor updates.
