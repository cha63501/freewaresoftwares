**Publisher's Description**  
  

Process Tamer is a tiny and efficient utility that runs in your system tray
and constantly monitors the CPU usage of other processes. When it sees a
process that is overloading your CPU, it reduces the priority of that process
temporarily until the usage returns to a reasonable level.
