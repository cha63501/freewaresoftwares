**Publisher's Description**  
  

CRP (Control Running Programs) is a solution that will control all running
programs within your windows session. In the section AInstance ControllingA,
you can specify how many instances of a particular program will run at the
same time, preventing memory overflow and instant program spawning from other
programs.

In the section AInstance LaunchingA, specific programs will be launched once
they have been closed, either by accident, from the user or the task manager.
Drag & Drop support from explorer is also supported and multiple entries allow
unlimited amount of programs to be used.

You can set CRP to start with the windows session, maintaining full control
without manual loading and spawning instance support will allow you to run
several copies of CRP at the same time. A full set of options are available
via the AOptionsA window and direct access to the current tasks list is also
available.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
