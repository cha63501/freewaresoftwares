**Publisher's Description**  
  


ActMon Process Monitoring displays detailed information about all running processes. For each process, it improves on Windows Task Manager, providing file path, security risk rating, description, start time, file version information and icon. 

Some background processes can pose a direct security threat that will disrupt or cause critical damage to your system. The detailed process library helps you to distinguish between system processes, known trustworthy programs and malware (adware, spyware, trojan horses, keylogger, virus).

For even more details on each process, APM can google the web for more information on each listed process.
