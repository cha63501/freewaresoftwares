**Publisher's Description**  
  

Rainmeter is a customizable performance meter, which can display the CPU load,
memory utilization, disk space, network traffic, time and many more things.

Through Rainmeter, you can enhance your Windows computer at home or work with
skins: handy, compact applets which float freely on your desktop, much like
Windows Sidebar gagdgets, or dashboard widgets for the Mac.

Rainmeter skins provide you with useful information at a glance. It's easy to
keep an eye on your system resources, like memory and battery power, or your
online data streams, including email, RSS feeds, and weather forecasts. Many
skins are even functional: they can record your notes and to-do lists, launch
your favorite applications, and send your tweets to Twitter - all in a clean,
unobtrusive interface that you can rearrange and customize to your liking.

Rainmeter is at once an application and a toolkit. You are only limited by
your imagination and creativity.
