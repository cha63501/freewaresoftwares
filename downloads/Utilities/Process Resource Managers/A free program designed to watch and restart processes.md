**Publisher's Description**  
  


ReStartMe is designed to do one thing, and that is to restart processes. The way ReStartMe is used is that when it is started, you add processes to watch. You can either start a new program, or add a currently running process. 

Once you tell ReStartMe to watch a process, it will watch it, but it wonA't react until the process exits. When a process that ReStartMe is watching exits for any reason, whether it was closed properly or not, ReStartMe will restart it.

**Features:**

  * Ability to watch multiple processes at once 
  * Ability to protect the interface with a password 
  * Minimizes to tray 
  * Ability to remember programs that were being watched between uses 
  * When adding processes, you can either start a new one or select from the currently running ones.
