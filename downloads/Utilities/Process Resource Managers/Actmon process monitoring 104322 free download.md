**Publisher's Description**  
  

ActMon Process Monitoring displays detailed information about all running
processes. For each process, it improves on Windows Task Manager, providing
file path, security risk rating, description, start time, file version
information and icon.

Some background processes can pose a direct security threat that will disrupt
or cause critical damage to your system. The detailed process library helps
you to distinguish between system processes, known trustworthy programs and
malware (adware, spyware, trojan horses, keylogger, virus).

For even more details on each process, APM can google the web for more
information on each listed process.
