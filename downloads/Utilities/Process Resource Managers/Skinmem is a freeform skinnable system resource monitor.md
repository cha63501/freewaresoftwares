**Publisher's Description**  
  


SkinMem is a freeform skinnable system resource monitor. The program displays the percentage of the current RAM being used by your PC as well as the available RAM left in Mbs. One difference between this system monitor and other similar programs is the realtime updating of the information. 

The skins can be any size or shape and the placement of the text details is totally up to the skinner as well. The skin can have a transparent color and requires only one bmp image with the ini file which makes skinning the program quite easy.
