**Publisher's Description**  
  


AntiFreeze tries to offer an innovative solution to a very common problem which has been experienced by nearly ever computer user: an unresponsive system which is so busy with the running tasks that it is virtually hanging and not usable anymore. AntiFreeze offers a last recourse when you find your computer in a hung state. 

Often in such a situation it may help you to press ALT+CTRL+DEL to start the Windows task manager so you can kill the process which is consuming all available resources. But if the system is so busy that it does not respond to your mouse clicks and key presses then even the task manager may not be able to help you. If you see no other solution than pressing the reset button, AntiFreeze may help you out instead. 

AntiFreeze will put to sleep all running programs except the most critical ones, giving you the opportunity to close down the programs which are causing problems. You may even be able to save or recover your work.
