**Publisher's Description**  
  

Systemometer is a unique monitoring tool that shows system activity and
resources as a screen saver or a thumbnail window. It allows you to create
different monitoring profiles out of the Windows performance counters
available on your system or remote hosts.

The interface displays the values of monitored parameters connecting all
measured points in one polygon - a snapshot view that helps to read the
overall system status at a glance. This method is also suitable for
understanding load balance of a specific parameter (e.g. CPU utilization)
among several items like computers or applications.

Different shapes of monitoring polygons draw visual patterns associated with
normal or critical system states. One look at the screen will tell you what is
happening with the system. The history of counter values can be recorded to
the log file in either HTML or CSV format.

Systemometer Personal Edition is free for individual use on a single computer
only.

**What's New in version 1.6.2:**

  * Added control to visibility of current, average, and maximal values individually. 
  * Corrected displaying maximal line for inverted axis. 
  * Fixed window start-up to follow minimized, maximized, or normal mode specified in the shortcut properties.
