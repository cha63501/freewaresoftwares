Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity.

  * Capture of thread stacks for each operation make it possible in many cases to identify the root cause of an operation 
  * Reliable capture of process details, including image path, command line, user and session ID

  * Filters can be set for any data field, including fields not configured as columns 
  * Advanced logging architecture scales to tens of millions of captured events and gigabytes of log data

  * Native log format preserves all data for loading in a different Process Monitor instance 
  * Process tooltip for easy viewing of process image information
