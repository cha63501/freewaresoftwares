CurrProcess utility displays a list of all processes currently running on your

  * Change the priority of a process. 
  * Kill a process.

  * Create HTML report containing information about a process with the list of all modules that it loads into memory. 
  * Save the list of all running processes into text or HTML file. 
  * Copy process or module information to the clipboard.
