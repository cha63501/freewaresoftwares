**Publisher's Description**  
  


A.K.A.P can come in handy if you want to cleanup related processes, after working with any application, or if you want to clear a set of expendable processes before starting another RAM intensive application, in just a few seconds, instead of using the tedious task manager. 

**Features:**

  * Ability to kill multiple processes, at once, from a single hitlist 
  * Add to windows start-up, to terminate stubborn start-up processes 
  * Can run in SILENT MODE A without any prompts or messages (one time configuration needed) 
  * Allows multiple hitlists, with a choice to save any one particular combination 
  * Choose the above combination at runtime or design time 
  * Kill individual running processes, useful for NOT RESPONDING processes 
  * Kill individual processes, from a Hitlist as well, instead of killing ALL of them 
  * Provides log entry for the each termination, so that users can know the termination status of each process 
  * Error log also available, to help understand any problem and to report bugs 
  * Auto clearing of termination logs, to save disk space 
**_Bug fixes in Version 2.1:_**

  * Terminating any process, kills instances of that process running under a different user as well, this is not desired.
  * Termination log doesnA't always reflect the accurate time interval between two consecutive terminations.
  * Any error that occurs while enumerating the list of running processes, halts the enumeration. [in 2nd Tab]
  * Empty process name is added when adding processes to hitlist for the first time. [in Tabs 2 & 3]
  * Had to click twice or double click on checked list box to "check mark" an item.[in Tabs 2,3, 4 & Hitlist Chooser window]
  * Auto clear termination logs must be applicable for each individual user. [in 4th Tab]
  * Log file always created for the month of January, irrespective of the current month. [in 4th Tab]
  * Minor modifications to avoid the application crashing under certain circumstances.
  
**_WhatAs new in Version 2.1:_**

  * Username included in process details for the running process.
  * Minor changes in user-interface.
  * Minor changes in logging information.
  
**_Known Issues in Version 2.1:_**

  * The application may not be able to run properly, when the user access levels/permissions are limited,   
with respect to manipulation of system registry and/or termination of processes. To prevent this try running the application with the required privileges. [I am working on a workaround for this. Hopefully it will be fixed in the next version]
