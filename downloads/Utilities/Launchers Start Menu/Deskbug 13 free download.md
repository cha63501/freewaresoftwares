**Publisher's Description**  
  

DeskBug is a file launcher with minimal screen presence. In simple terms itA's
a movable screen graphic with a menu attached. Files can be executive,
document, graphic, links etc. You can for example drop links from your
favorites list or add a web page reference so that your browser opens with a
particular site or you can add image files to open in your default viewer.
Programs can be opened by adding either the exe file or a link file. You can
set up multiple links to run at the same time.

Setting up DeskBug is as simple as it gets. Set a screen graphic, add files to
the menu, create a startup link and forget it!

The screen graphic can be moved with your mouse and the menu is accessed with
your right mouse button. The graphic can be as small as a few pixels and
placed anywhere on the screen. Icon files are ideal but it will accept a
variety of formats. DeskBug can be so non-intrusive it can be placed anywhere
on the screen that is convenient.

Update adds link check and improved code.
