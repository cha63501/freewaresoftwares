Launches any program for inserted CD - just associate program(s) to launch
with your CD. To launch the program from CDs, you only need "autorun.inf"
file: when your desire changes, change the program(s) to launch.

For foreign CDs (which are not in the A'CD MatchA' database) , A'CD MatchA'
can collect files by their extensions for inserted (or presented) CDs, and
offer to launch - just define what to collect.
