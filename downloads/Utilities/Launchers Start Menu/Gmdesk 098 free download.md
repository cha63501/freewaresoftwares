GMDesk is an application that lets you run Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs
and Google Maps as a stand-alone application to do all your mail handling,
calendar event reading etc with. No need to open it up in a web browser, or
have it clutter your workspace.

shift between this application and the other ones you are running.

GMDesk offers an easy menu as well as keyboard shortcuts to switch between
different Google services, and you can specify what default service you want
the application to start with. It also supports Google Apps access as well.
