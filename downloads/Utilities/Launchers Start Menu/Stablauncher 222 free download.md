**Publisher's Description**  
  

sTabLauncher is a free and easy way to find and run all your favorite
programs, folders, Web pages, with just one click. You can create and
personalize your tabs with any color, shape or transparency. Now you can have
a clean desktop, and still have a fast access to everything you need, with
style.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).

**What's New in version 2.2.2:**

**New Options:**

  * Show on top os fullScreen application (YES/NO) - By default it's set to false. This will cause sTabLauncher to hide when an application is running in fullscreen mode. 
  * Configuration file on the Application's directory - By default it's false. If set to true, the configuration file will be on the same directory as the sTabLauncher.exe. This can be handy if you want to keep sTabLauncher on a memory stick, or if you want multiple instances running at the same time with diferent configurations. 

**Changes:**

  * Back to .NET 2.0 - Why? Simply because .NET 2.0 is lighter on resources than 3.5. 
  * Option to install Babylon 8
