**Publisher's Description**  
  

ServerDoc will start a program and check if the program is still running every
five seconds and restart the program if required (if it crashed, etc.). It can
also rotate servers with its internal scheduling. You may want to run a game
server between 6pm and 10pm or run different game servers hourly/daily/weekly
or monthly. Serverdoc can even be set up to load a different mod/patch. You
could have your servers set up to run Normal DeathMatch one night, Team
Fortress the next, Counterstrike the night after.
