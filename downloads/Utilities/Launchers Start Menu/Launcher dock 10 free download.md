**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you use multiple screens, there are certain applications you start and use
every time you turn on your computer. You open up Gmail to check your email
and then you move that window to one corner of the screen, then you open up
Skype and move that to the other side of the screen. Then comes Word and the
list goes on. This can become tedious, repetitive and time consuming. Now
there is a solution and itA's called Launcher Dock. The purpose for creating
this simple but clever software was to:

  * save time when starting your computer
  * customize where your programs are displayed and on which screen
  * simplify the way you manage different applications on the screens
  * automatically open your favourites websites

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
