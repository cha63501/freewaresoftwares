**Publisher's Description**  
  


If you use multiple screens, there are certain applications you start and use every time you turn on your computer. You open up Gmail to check your email and then you move that window to one corner of the screen, then you open up Skype and move that to the other side of the screen. Then comes Word and the list goes on. This can become tedious, repetitive and time consuming. Now there is a solution and itA's called Launcher Dock. The purpose for creating this simple but clever software was to: 

  * save time when starting your computer
  * customize where your programs are displayed and on which screen
  * simplify the way you manage different applications on the screens
  * automatically open your favourites websites

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
