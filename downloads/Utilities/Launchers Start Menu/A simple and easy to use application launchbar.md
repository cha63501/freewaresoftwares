**Publisher's Description**  
  


ProgramLaunch is a simple and easy to use application launchbar for the Windows operating systems. Initially made as a tool to circumvent the annoying start menu, this third generation is completely redesigned from scratch to improve flexibility and performance and make everyday use of the launcher as comfortable as possible. 

Managing the launchpad is simple and intuitive. Programs are added either through a dialog or by dragging links from Windows onto the launchpad. Organizing the programs is also done easily by dragging the icons and groups around. Assign one or more shortcuts for each icon.

These are used for launching a program by one simple keystroke. If a shortcut key combination is assigned to multiple icons, a list is shown for selecting the which program needs launching. 

**What's New in version 3.33:**

  * Fixed broken drag'n'drop of programs and files to the launcher window 

**What's New in version 3.32:**

  * Unicode updates to support Chinese and similar languages 
  * Added Brazilian and Chinese (simplified and traditional) languages 
  * Added some missing translations 
  * Added commandline option for selecting an alternate setting file. Default is -ini=path_to_programpl3.ini 
  * Added commandline option for selecting an alternate configuration file and icon cache location. Default is -cfg=path_to_programpl3.xml 
  * Added commandline switch for suppressing the about splash. The switch is -nosplash 
  * Changed encoding of contents file (pl3.xml) to UTF-8 
  * Updated the Dutch translation 
  * Upgraded to Drag and Drop Component Suite 4.2 
  * Upgraded memory manager to FastMM 4.90 
  * Corrected execution of programs to support relative paths 
  * Fixed translation of shortcut selections in the preference dialog. They did not reflect language changes until ProgramLaunch was restarted 
  * Fixed small memory leak occurring when trying to load an image that does not exist
