**Publisher's Description**  
  


Have a job that should be run exactly once each day? KarenA's Once-A-Day II is just what you need! The program lets you specify progams, web pages and files. Each will be run or opened automatically, the first time Windows starts each day, or the first time a particular user logs on each day. Start Windows, or log on, more than once in any given day and the programs, pages, and files will not be re-opened! 

**What's New in version 1.2:**

  * When started automatically, the program still asks if you want to add a command, if none have been entered. But now there's a checkbox that, if checked, prevents this reminder in the future.
