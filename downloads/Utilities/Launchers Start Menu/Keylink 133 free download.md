**Publisher's Description**  
  

Keylink allows you to launch programs without searching the start menu or
directories. It works similar to the search in the Windows Vista start menu.

The main idea is as follows.

You have created the following entries in Keylink:  
  
Adobe Photoshop CS  
Adobe Image Ready  
Borland Delphi 7 Enterprise  
Microsoft Outlook  
Microsoft Word  
  
You want to launch Photoshop.  
To do this you bring the Keylink window to the front by pressing the keyboard
shortcut Strg-Windows button.  
In Keylink you now type "phot" and as "Adobe Photoshop CS" is the only entry
containing "phot" only this entry is viewed. Now you press enter and Photoshop
is launched.  
  
If you want to view all the programs from the company Adobe you just type
"Adobe". Now the first two entries are shown.  
  
Adding files and folders to Keylink is ususally done using drag&drop.  
  
Keylink can also execute windows orders. To do this a comma has to be typed
before the search text.  
",regedit" will launch the registry editor for example and  
",ping 192.168.1.1" will ping the given ip.  
  
Additionally it is possible to navigate in directories and to do basic file
operations.
