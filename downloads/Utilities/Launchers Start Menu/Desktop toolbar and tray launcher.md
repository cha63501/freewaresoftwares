**Publisher's Description**  
  


Advanced Launcher is an integrated toolbar and tray launcher. It can show several fully customizable toolbars at a time. When you click a toolbar button it can either run an application (open a document) or show multilevel customizable menu. Menus can also show contents of folders (e.g. Programs folder from the Start menu or Desktop folder). You can minimize toolbars to tray and access them as menus. 

**Features:**

  * Works under Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008 operating system (or higher). 
  * You can create several toolbars that can be shown at the same time. Each toolbar can be shown as a button bar or as a tray icon. 
  * Button bars can dock to the edges of the screen like Windows application bars. Docked bars can be autohidden so they donA't consume any space on the screen. They appear when you move cursor to the screen edge. 
  * You can create your own menu system (with submenus), which can contain any items that you want. The unique feature of Advanced Launcher is that you can associate menu items with the folders so there will be submenus with the items referring to the items of the folder. It is especially useful if you have a folder with shortcuts (e.g. Programs or Desktop) on your disk and want to quickly access these links. 
  * If the toolbar is shown as a tray icon you can access all the items of the toolbar. Click left mouse button on the tray icon to do that. 
  * You can vary different toolbar properties (style of buttons, border, etc.) and items (command, parameters, icon, etc.) 
  * Advanced Launcher is really easy to use. All options are shown in one window, you can navigate through options of toolbars, items and the program with the help of the tree view control.
