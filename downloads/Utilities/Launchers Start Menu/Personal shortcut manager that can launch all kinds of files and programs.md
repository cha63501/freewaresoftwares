**Publisher's Description**  
  


Launcher is an easy-to-use personal shortcut manager that can launch all kinds of files and programs. Drag-and-drop operations are supported; this means that when Launcher is in "Manage Items" mode, it is possible to configure shortcuts by "dragging" files from e.g. Windows Desktop and then "dropping" them into Launcher. One can create an unlimited amount of user defined sub-folders and item (e.g. program) shortcuts. 

Launcher always resides in the system tray per default; however, one can turn this off in settings. Launcher also has various GUI options, e.g. customizable program font setup (name and size).
