**Publisher's Description**  
  

Launch applications, commands, open files and folders with hotkeys. You can
work faster and more efficiently by using your keyboard instead of your mouse.

HotKeyz lets you easily create and maintain a categorized list of your
hotkeys. Each hotkey, a key combination on your keyboard, will launch a
command. You decide which commands go with which hotkeys. Some of these
commands are internal HotKeyz commands and the rest are Windows commands.
HotKeyz will help you to manage repetitive tasks on your PC with speed and
minimal effort.

The Parameter option gives you parameter control when launching another
application like Internet Explorer and surfing to a specific site as
parameter. For example \"C:\\\Program Files\\\Internet
Explorer\\\Iexplore.exe\" with the parameter \"www.skynergy.com\". It also
features launching your e-mail window when composing a new e-mail even if your
e-mail program is not active or focused.

Define shortcuts for Launching files, Minimizing the current active window,
showing HotKeyz itself or hiding it. The HotKeyz system tray icon will change
to indicate a key press. The shortcuts work with the WIN, CTRL, ALT, SHIFT
modifier keys and most other keyboard keys. You can even enable or disable
unwanted Hotkeys without deleting them from the Key List.

**What's New in version 2.8.3.0:**

  * Fixed the category that disappeared when renaming a new category. 
  * Fixed the commands that didn't execute because of their case. HotKeyz will ignore the case. 
  * Fixed the Access Violations that appeared when HotKeyz don't have write access to the HotKeyz folder.
