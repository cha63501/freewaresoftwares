**Publisher's Description**  
  

InstallBuddy is a very powerful and easy to use multi-install application.
Created for use as an autorun in a disk. ItA's divided into two main parts.

The first is the installer which is the main window for installing the
applications. They can be found from the main list, by the tags they have or
even using search. Installing more than one at once is supported as well.
There is also a list for standalone programs (they can be copied to a selected
folder or run directly).

The second part is the editor where the user adds information
(name,version,tag,description etc) for every application and standalone.
InstallBuddy has a one-click autocreate action for creating the basic
information of every install that exists in a specific folder. The user can
also create presets for preselected application. Finally there is an action
that runs a test for every entry and informs user for errors in essential
information.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
