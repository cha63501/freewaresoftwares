RocketDock is a smoothly animated, alpha-blended application launcher that is similar to ObjectDock. RocketDock renders very fast like MobyDock, has YA'z DockA's visual sharpness and the stability that neither seem to possess. 

It is compatible with every dock skin format we are aware of. In fact, if you have a skin that doesnA't load properly, send it to us, along with a screenshot of what it should look like and weA'll see what we can do about integrating the format.
