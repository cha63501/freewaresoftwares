**Publisher's Description**  
  

Basically nDroid is a blazing fast keyboard based application launcher. But
not just that, it can open documents, play songs, open browser bookmarks,
lookup web references, find torrents, do online searches, find your files ..
plus a lot more.

nDroid uses an open plugin based infrastructure, so anybody can add to its
functionality by bringing anything to its searchable domain, and doing
anything with the result, and not just launch an application.

Forget using your mouse to fiddle with Start Menus, Application Docks and
Favorites Menus. There is no need to organise your files. Just fire up nDroid
and itA'll help you open them in a jiffy.

**Features:**

  * Starts with your recently launched items, so to launch one of these you wonA't even have to search a bit. 
  * Indexes your start menu, desktop, documents and favorite websites, and can launch all these with just a few keystrokes. 
  * Finds web references, does web searches, looks up online encyclopedias, finds movie reviews.. and lots more. 
  * Advanced fuzzy search positions the most likely matches closest available. 
  * Can also serve as the Start Menu A'RunA' option 
  * Universal Open With - Right click on any file in explorer and select nDroid. Select any application in nDroid and the file will open in that application. 
  * Though its interface is sleek, it doesnA't expend system resources on looking good. Its purpose is to find what youA're looking for, with minimal effort and do it fast. And thatA's what it does. 
  * Though the memory used by nDroid is minimal, it can be used in Not-Always-Running mode. Here its launched by hotkey as needed, and exits right after launching an app. 
  * Calculator : Type a A'?A' followed by a mathematical expression and nDroid calculates the answer. 
  * It supports plugins to extend its action and search capabilities.
