Microsoft made a radical change when it introduced Windows 8 start menu, whereby it covers the entire screen. Indeed, people argue that the Metro user interface is not really a start menu. Many people would like to go back to the conventional start menu without downgrading their operating systems for different reasons. One of the best applications you can use to do this is Start Menu 8 from IObit. 

Start Menu 8 is a great Windows start menu alternative that will help you use windows 8 in the way you are used to. It is especially ideal for people who use the start menu frequently.

**Installing Start Menu 8**

During the installation of Start Menu 8, we were given the option to install Advanced SystemCare 6 from IObit. Although the default option was 'Yes,' we also had the freedom to skip it. The program installed easily after we had chosen the style we wanted for our start button and menu.

**Using Start Menu 8**

Start Menu 8 brought back the familiar Windows 7 start menu without getting rid of the Metro Start screen. We could also make it resemble Windows XP among others. One of the options found on the start menu is 'Switch to Metro,' which takes you back to the native Windows 8 UI.

We found it relatively easy to configure Start Menu 8, including the ability to hide or show selected items. If you want, you can even disable the hot corners that bring up the Windows 8 Side bar.

In addition, the program provides the ability to skip the Metro start screen when booting and go directly to the desktop, which provides access to the start button in the usual position at the lower left corner.

**Verdict**

While we enjoyed using the native Metro start menu of Windows 8, finding some things proved rather tricky. What helped us was the search function that allowed us to use keywords to locate what we wanted in apps, settings and files.

Start Menu 8 made it easy to get what we wanted, and it also included a search function similar to that of Windows 7. We also liked the fact that it allowed us to switch to the Metro UI whenever we wished. This is a handy start menu alternative for Windows 8 users.
