**Publisher's Description**  
  

ProgramLaunch is a simple and easy to use application launchbar for the
Windows operating systems. Initially made as a tool to circumvent the annoying
start menu, this third generation is completely redesigned from scratch to
improve flexibility and performance and make everyday use of the launcher as
comfortable as possible.

Managing the launchpad is simple and intuitive. Programs are added either
through a dialog or by dragging links from Windows onto the launchpad.
Organizing the programs is also done easily by dragging the icons and groups
around. Assign one or more shortcuts for each icon.

These are used for launching a program by one simple keystroke. If a shortcut
key combination is assigned to multiple icons, a list is shown for selecting
the which program needs launching.
