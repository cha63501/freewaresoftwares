**Publisher's Description**  
  

AutoRun.exe is a Win32 executable program intended for use with the Windows
95, 98, Me, NT4, 2000, and XP AutoRun facility. As you are probably aware,
this facility (if enabled) will automatically run an executable as soon as a
CD-ROM is inserted into the CD drive of the computer.

One limitation of the standard AutoRun facility is the fact that it will only
run executable programs; it will not by itself open document files such as web
pages or text files. AutoRun.exe is designed to circumvent this restriction:
it will open any number of document files or start executable programs.
Moreover, it is smart enough to use a sensible fall-back strategy if no
documents can be opened, perhaps because the target system does not have the
required support for those document types.

AutoRun.exe requires no special support files apart from the usual autorun.inf
file; in fact, it will even function without that file. Its flexibility and
small size (only 8 KB) ensure that it loads very quickly and fits in almost
any situation, even if the CD-ROM is nearly full.
