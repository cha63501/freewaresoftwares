**Publisher's Description**  
  

Find and Run Robot is a program for keyboard maniacs - it helps you rapidly
find programs or documents from within the depths of the start menu (or other
directories). One keypress launches the utility - then just start typing the
first letters of the application you want to launch. As you type the best
matches are shown - just hit the number to launch the associated program.
