**Publisher's Description**  
  

QuickFind - if you have many programs installed on your system you will notice
a loss of overview (and time) in your start menu because of the huge amount of
Shortcuts. QuickFind is your first aid.

It joins shortcuts from your start menu and your desktop together and puts
those in a list box. You only need to enter a short term (e.g. the programsA'
name) and press Enter.

In addition to that QuickFind can rename, delete or send shortcuts to
different places (Desktop, Registry, Auto run...) and many more.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
nloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows
XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
