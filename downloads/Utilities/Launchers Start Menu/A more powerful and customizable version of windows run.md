**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is a more powerful and customizable version of windows run. The program originated as I was sick of spending too much time searching for programs through my ever growing windows start-menu and also found myself using windows run more and more frequently. There was of course already programs like this available, but each had itA's annoyance or missing features or too(!) geeky. So I decide to code my own. 

**Features:**

  * Keywords have properties like shortcuts, and you can for example drag-drop a shortcut/file/folder/favorite to add it as a keyword. 
  * Auto-completion for keywords, file system and history (can also be configured). 
  * Enter URLs directly (like www.google.com or http://www.google.com). 
  * Keywords support parameters. Example "google latest executor" "wiki nirvana". 
  * Optional show icon for current keyword/input. 
  * Optional show drop-down box for current keyword/input (auto-completion). 
  * Optional drop-down box can be set to auto-open (like windows run) displaying auto-completion suggestions. 
  * Optional Vista like list displaying matching items. 
  * Layout can be customized. Set colors, font, dimensions, position, transparency and more. 
  * Skinable. 
  * Many settings to customize the program as you like. 
  * Shortcut keys for faster navigation. 
  * Can be launched from an user defined hotkey. 
  * One keyword or text input can start multiple keywords/urls/programs/documents/files etc. Example one keyword opens three websites and/or programs. 
  * A number of special commands (like for example pause and replace tag with parameter). 
  * Optional windows context-menu integration (as another way of easily adding new keywords). 
  * Optional show title for the current input. 
  * Can import keywords from windows start-menu. 
  * Integrated calculator. 
  * Import/Export keywords.
