**Publisher's Description**  
  

LaunchPad lets you use your keyboard to start programs, open files, view
folders, and launch web sites. LaunchPad is much faster than using a mouse.

LaunchPad is fast. Forget about WindowsA' maze of menus and icons. Run your
computer using just a few keystrokes.

LaunchPad is flexible. You tell it what commands to use, what programs to run,
what documents to open, what directories to view, what sites to launch. It
does the rest.

LaunchPad is simple. Did you see the interface?

LaunchPad is powerful. It comes pre-configured, ready to launch all sorts of
goodies hidden in Windows. Some Windows programs, such as msconfig and
regedit, can only be accessed through the command line.

LaunchPad is smart. It understands that you may work at multiple computers.
You can use one command to launch a program that has different locations and
even different file names on different computers. ThereA's no need to maintain
separate data files for separate machines.

LaunchPad is portable. Just copy a single text file to another computer
running LaunchPad, and youA're good to go.

LaunchPad comes with outstanding references. Entering "d spartan" takes you to
the reference.com dictionary entry for the word spartan; "s spartan" loads a
web search for spartan; "t spartan" loads the thesaurus for synonyms of
spartan; "w spartan" takes you to the Wikipedia entry for spartan; "a spartan"
returns an about.com search for spartan.

LaunchPad is lean. It uses just over 1 MB of memory.

LaunchPad is free. This is an open source project, powered by Liberty BASIC
and Hot Key Plus.
