**Publisher's Description**  
  


PC-Com gives you an easier and faster alternative to use your computer. You can use it on your home computer, laptop, or business computer. Instead of double-clicking icons on your desktop, and searching for programs in your Start Menu, you can quickly load anything on your computer or the internet from PC-Com. 

PC-Com is a program launcher that lets you open files, folders, and websites by typing keywords. When you want to open something, all you have to do is press a hotkey (semicolon) on your keyboard, type a keyword, and press enter. For example, typing aol as a keyword will open America Online; typing word as a keyword will open Microsoft Word; typing yahoo.com will open http://www.yahoo.com. You can just type the first couple letters of a keyword and still access it by pressing enter. 

ThereA's more to PC-Com than just keywords. You can open websites (typing google.com will take you to http://www.google.com), and you can open files and folders (example: c:\program files). You can also use letter commands to search the internet (example: s:mp3s), look up a word in a dictionary or a thesaurus, find related web sites, and shut down or restart your computer.

PC-Com is only visible when you press a hotkey and type a keyword. The toolbar disappears after you press Enter. This provides even more convenience and work space for you.
