**Publisher's Description**  
  

Scheduler allows you to schedule tasks to perform at a particular time of day.
Tasks include the ability to open any file in its default program, open a URL
in the default web browser and shutdown or restart your computer. The main
window can be minimised to the system tray.

The uses of this range from using it as an alarm clock or reminder to shutting
down your computer at a set time after any remaining tasks have been
completed.
