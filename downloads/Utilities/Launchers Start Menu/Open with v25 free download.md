**Publisher's Description**  
  

This program opens a "Open with..." -dialog which lists a set of programs you
can use to open the specified file or URL (URI) with.

When making this program the main reason was for URLA's because of the need to
open URLA's with the browser of my choice, but itA's possible to use this
program with any sorts of files or programs, not just URLA's.

A nice feature is that you can modify the URL before opening it. As an example
you could remove a click tracker from an URL, frequently used in newsletters,
etc.

Please let me know if you use it and find it useful!

**Features:**

  * Configurable list of programs.
  * Possibility to edit the URI before open it.
  * Possibility to cancel the opening of unwanted URIA's.
  * Possibility to use Regular Expressions to modify URI. (v2.4)
  * No installation needed!
  * No need to register the program with a file type. (v2.5)

**Possible usage:**

  * You need the possibility to open a specific file type with multiple applications.
  * You want an easier way to open files with no file extension.
  * If registered with URLA's it can be used as Read-it-later.
  * You want to filter or remap certain URIA's.
