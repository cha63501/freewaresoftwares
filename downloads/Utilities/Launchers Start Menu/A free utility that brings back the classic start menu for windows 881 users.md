StartMenu 8+ is a free application that creates a Windows 8 Start Menu with two possible options. You can choose to use the classic Start Menu without replacing the Metro interface of Windows 8. Alternatively, you may substitute the interface completely with the Classic Start Menu. 

**Features:**

  * Enables and disables the charms bar and hot corners 
  * Enables and disables the Metro interface on windows 8 and 8.1 
  * The ability to perform search on the Start Menu 
  * Ability to pin applications to the Start Menu 
  * Displays recently used files for the pinned applications 
  * Can enable transparency 
  * Supports over 40 languages 

**Using Start Menu 8+**

The application installs easily, and you can create a desktop shortcut during the installation. We could bring it up either by clicking on the Windows key or moving our mouse to the lower left corner of the screen but not in the hot corner that normally activated the Metro interface. The Start button resided just above the taskbar. However, its features resembled those of the Windows 7 Start Menu. If Windows 8 Metro is disabled, the Start button takes the position of the hot corner.

Start Menu 8+ included shortcuts to common folders like Documents, Downloads, Music and Pictures. It also provides easy access to the Control Panel and power options.

Although the program had predefined programs, we could delete the ones we did not want. We noticed that it included some programs that we did not have on our system. The program also allowed us to create shortcuts to the applications we used frequently. It made the process simple because it added the ability to send applications to the Start Menu within the WindowAs context menu.

The Settings panel allowed us to configure Start Menu 8+ to suit our preferences. For example, we could adjust the dimension of the Start icon or make the Start Menu transparent. If you disable the hot corners, charms bar and Metro Start interface, then you must restart your computer to activate the settings.

**Pros**

  * Simple user interface 
  * Easy to use 
  * Multilingual 
  * Allows users who donAt like hot corners and Metro interface to disable them 

**Cons**

  * None so far 

If you love Windows 8 except for its Metro features, then StartMenu 8 + will help you use it as you would Windows 7.
