**Publisher's Description**  
  

Switch easily between Windows 8 old Start Menu and Windows Metro Style start
screen.

This tool hides in system tray (notification area). Just click any of the
icons representing the old Windows Start Menu (orb) or Windows Metro Style to
modify windows registry. Then click Restart Explorer youA'll see the changes.

This will change to the old windows start menu (orb) in Windows 8, but it will
also disable Explorer with ribbon and taskmanager. And if you want to keep
Ribbon Explorer and the New TaskManager, use the button which requires admin
privileges instead of the icons.

All changes are reversible.

**Features:**

  * Run at startup, so you can change it anytime you want 
  * Hides on system tray (notification area) 
  * Only works on Windows 8 
  * tested on Windows 8 32bits build 8102 
  * special button to only enable/disable old windows start menu (keeps ribbon explorer and new taskmanager), requires admin privileges 

If you currently do not have Windows 8 installed, [download Windows 8
