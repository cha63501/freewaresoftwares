**Publisher's Description**  
  

Start My Day is a first of its kind freeware for Windows users. Simply put,
Start My Day is for those users who hate going through the same process each
day, loading this and that.

With Start My Day, a user can pre-configure a list of applications web links
and music to automatically load using an Alarm clock. A user also has the
option of running them manually from the list. The application supports
dragging and dropping items to the list as well as browsing for items.

The software has three tabs or lists. The **App list**, **Web list** & **Music
list**.

  * The Application List will only accept .exe files currently. 
  * The Web List will only accept .url files which can be found in your Favorites folder. 
  * The Music List will only accept .mp3 files. The playlist is saved in WPL format. Players that play the WPL Playlist type are Windows Media Player, Winamp, VLC, etc. 
The save settings for all items are stored in the following location:
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Start My Day.

The app may get some time getting used to but, but once you get the hang of
it, you will find that since it automates most of the things you do daily, it
makes computing that much easier for you!
