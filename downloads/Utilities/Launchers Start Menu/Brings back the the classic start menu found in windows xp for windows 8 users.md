Many applications that replace the Metro Start Screen found in Windows 8 bring the Classic Start Menu found in Windows 7. However, there are many people who love Windows XP even though Microsoft has stopped supporting it. Can you upgrade to Windows 8 but still retain the Start Menu you grew to love in Windows XP? Yes, you can. 

Spencer allows you to get the Classic Windows XP Start Menu without replacing your Windows 8.1 Start button. Once you have downloaded the 429KB application in ZIP archive, you will need to extract it to your selected directory, right-click it and then select APin to TaskbarA. Alternatively, you can create a keyboard shortcut that allows you to open the Classic Start Menu. You can do this in the icon properties.

Whichever method you use, you will easily access all Start Menu entries, including having direct access to the Run dialog, Administrator command line and the Control Panel.
