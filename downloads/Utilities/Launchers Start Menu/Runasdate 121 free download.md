**Publisher's Description**  
  

RunAsDate is a small utility that allows you to run a program in the date and
time that you specify. RunAsDate will not change the current system date and
time of your PC, but it only injects the date/time that you specify into the
desired application.

You can run multiple applications simultaneously, each application works with
different date and time, while the real date/time of your system continues to
run normally.

**How does it work?**  
RunAsDate intercepts the kernel API calls that returns the current date and
time (GetSystemTime, GetLocalTime, GetSystemTimeAsFileTime), and replaces the
current date/time with the date/time that you specify.

**Using RunAsDate**  
RunAsDate doesnA't require any installation process or additional DLL files.
In order to start using it, simply copy the executable file (RunAsDate.exe) to
any folder you like, and run it.

In the main window of RunAsDate, select the desired date and time and the
application that you want to run. Optionally, you can also specify the
command-line parameters to run the program. Press the "Run" button to start
the application with the specified date/time.

**Using RunAsDate from Command-Line**  
You can also use RunAsDate from command-line, with the following syntax:
RunAsDate.exe [dd\mm\yyyy] {hh:mm:ss} [Program to run] {Program parameters}

**Examples:**  
RunAsDate.exe 22\10\2002 12:35:22 "C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\OFFICE11\OUTLOOK.EXE" RunAsDate.exe 14\02\2005 "c:\temp\myprogram.exe"

  * RunAsDate only works on 32-bit Windows applications. You cannot use it for old DOS 16-bit programs or for 64-bit Windows applications. 
  * RunAsDate will not affect applications that take the current date/time from another source. For example: application that loads the current date from remote server. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.21:**

  * Fixed bug with 'Move the time forward according to the real time' option: After around 7 minutes from the time that the application was started, RunAsDate failed to calculate the time properly.
