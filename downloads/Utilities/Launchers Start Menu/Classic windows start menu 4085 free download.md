**Publisher's Description**  
  

Recover Windows XP classic menu for Windows Vista and Windows 7, including
Aero and Glass effects.

Once executed, this tool will launch a Windows XP-style menu that you can call
in the same ways you used to do before: Win key, Ctrl+Esc or clicking left
mouse button on the Windows logo; if you click right button, the application
will ask you to exit. So easy!

ClassicWinStartMenu updates menus every time, and shows you the last installed
applications but, unfortunately, has not the drag & drop feature to add,
remove, rename or sort items: You can do these on the original menu, and
changes will be reflected into your new menu, except on sorting (may be in
future releases...).

Memory and disk requirements are really low (less than 4 MB of memory and 1 MB
of hard disk space).
