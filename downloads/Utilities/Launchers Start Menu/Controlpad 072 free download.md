**Publisher's Description**  
  

ControlPad turns the numeric keypad on your keyboard to a Windows command
execution system.

You may configure any numeric code to: Execute any program, open any document,
open any web address or send any series of keystrokes to the operating system.

Once ControlPad is running, press and hold the * key on the numeric keypad,
for about 1 second. At this point, a small window will pop up, allowing you to
enter any keyword or numeric code.

Pressing the code followed by Enter will execute the associated command.

Commands are easily configured through the same interface - activate the input
dialog (press and hold *), enter the desired code and press the numpad Divide
button to associate a new command.

**WhatA's new in this version 0.72:**

  * Ability to search the web directly from the command console. By default, any command that is not recognized will attempt to find a relevant webpage using Google Feeling Lucky feature. This functionality can be disabled or modified in the Advanced section of the settings.
