**Publisher's Description**  
  

How long does it take you to find an application in the long Start menu list?
The Handy Start Menu utility will reduce that time as it will automatically
group applications in the menu by categories depending on their purpose.

The utility makes the menu so convenient that you will no longer have to
create piles of shortcuts on the desktop, create complex panels in the Quick
Launch bar and spend time browsing through the long list, trying to find an
application that you have not placed on the desktop or Quick Launch bar.

Also, it will be easier to access items in the menu. You will only have to
click the folder with the name of a program, and our utility will run that
application automatically.

**Note:** Requires free activation.

**Note from FreewareFiles about this ad-ware:**

  * The program offers a 3rd party application which does not have to be installed to use the software.
