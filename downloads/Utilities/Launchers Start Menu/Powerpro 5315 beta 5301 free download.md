PowerPro lets you take control of how you use Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP. Run
commands and configure your system any way you want.

PowerPro gives you a compact and powerful launch bar, menu, and tray icon
facility. But this is just the start. With a little experimenting with its
configuration, youA'll find that you can use PowerPro to change the way you
work with your system.

The source of its power is the way PowerPro integrates three capabilities:

  * Running commands: Tool bars, tray icons, hot keys, mouse actions, menus, timer, scheduler. 
  * Controlling other programA's windows: Close, minimize, maximize, roll-up to caption, tray minimize, position. 
  * Providing utility functions: Send keystrokes to programs, run commands when windows first open, virtual desktops, clipboard extender, keyboard macros, shutdown, show all folder files in a menu, sounds, wallpaper, and screensaver activation and randomization.
