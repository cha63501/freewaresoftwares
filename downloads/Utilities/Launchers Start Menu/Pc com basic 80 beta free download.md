**Publisher's Description**  
  

PC-Com gives you an easier and faster alternative to use your computer. You
can use it on your home computer, laptop, or business computer. Instead of
double-clicking icons on your desktop, and searching for programs in your
Start Menu, you can quickly load anything on your computer or the internet
from PC-Com.

PC-Com is a program launcher that lets you open files, folders, and websites
by typing keywords. When you want to open something, all you have to do is
press a hotkey (semicolon) on your keyboard, type a keyword, and press enter.
For example, typing aol as a keyword will open America Online; typing word as
a keyword will open Microsoft Word; typing yahoo.com will open
http://www.yahoo.com. You can just type the first couple letters of a keyword
and still access it by pressing enter.

ThereA's more to PC-Com than just keywords. You can open websites (typing
google.com will take you to http://www.google.com), and you can open files and
folders (example: c:\program files). You can also use letter commands to
search the internet (example: s:mp3s), look up a word in a dictionary or a
thesaurus, find related web sites, and shut down or restart your computer.

PC-Com is only visible when you press a hotkey and type a keyword. The toolbar
disappears after you press Enter. This provides even more convenience and work
space for you.
