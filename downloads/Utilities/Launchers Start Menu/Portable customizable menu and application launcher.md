**Publisher's Description**  
  


SyMenu is an USB application menu. Also works great with your local PC. 

You can customize SyMenu in a simple and quick way adding links to portable programs, files, Windows commands, folders and URLs.

Linked items (SyItems) have to reside on the same USB stick or disk even if Symenu supports links to absolute path (such as C:\Windows\Explorer.exe).

SyMenu supports every portable program but you can try to install inside your USB device even programs that donA't need to access to registry or file system folders outside the programA's root (for example to check a serial key registry hive or a license file).

  * Start Search bar: (Windows Vista like) allows to quickly search amongst any SyItem configured on menu; 
  * Windows Start Menu wrapper: SyMenu exposes through Start Search bar every program linked in host PC Windows Start menu too;

  * Autoexec: allows to launch a SyItem custom list at SyMenu startup. 
  * Execution modes: Run, RunAs, Open folder and Show Properties.
