**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pretty run was started years ago when Windows knew nothing about searching
through the Start Menu. It helps you find shortcuts.

Many times we know we have a program somewhere in the Start Menu, but it takes
too much time to locate its icon and run it. Pretty Run helps you with that as
it searches the Start Menu, desktop or any other folder for the shortcuts or
files that meet your query.

With Vista/7, Windows has their own search box. But Pretty Run is now much
more:

  * Search through Internet Explorer favorites 
  * Search through Firefox bookmarks 
  * Search through Chrome bookmarks 
  * Search printers and start printer properties 
  * Search through Control panel items 
  * Setup internet search engines and you can search internet with selected engine 
  * Remember last items copied to clipboard and bring them back in case you need them 
  * Search through mp3 files (not file names but tags) 
  * Run a group of programs with one click 
  * Setup your magic words and start favorite programs really quickly
