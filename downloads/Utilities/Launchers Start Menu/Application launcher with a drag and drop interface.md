**Publisher's Description**  
  


ToolBox is an application launcher for Windows operating systems with many amazing features. Easy to install, you can get going in minutes. Its drag & drop interface creates shortcuts to almost anything; applications, drives, folders, even simple files. ToolBox helps you organise your desktop and get rid of numerous shortcuts that clutter it and take up valuable space. 

The first version of ToolBox was written many years ago as a 16-bit Windows 3.1 application using Borland Pascal. Since then many features have been added to it, in order to maximize its usefulness.

A fully portable application, ToolBox does not need installation. All you have to do is unzip the distribution files on a directory and run the executable. Upgrading your operating system does not affect it. Moving it to a different folder is never a problem. To uninstall you just delete the directory you created for the first run.

ToolBox is particularly useful for removable media (USB drives) or as an application launcher in read-only media (CD-ROM).

**Features:**

  * multiple application launching windows 
  * shortcuts to almost everything (files, urls, folders, drives) 
  * support for any icon size, Windows XP alpha-channel icon transparency 
  * transparency effects even on Windows 95/98/Me 
  * fully customisable user interface 
  * monitor drive sizes 
  * monitor operating system up-time 

**What's New in version 2.85:**

  * Bug fix for exception when mouse-up event is sent to ToolBox without a previous mouse-down.
