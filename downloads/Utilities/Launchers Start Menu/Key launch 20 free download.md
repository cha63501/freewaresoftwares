**Publisher's Description**  
  

Forget your start menu and the icons on your desktop - launch programs and
documents from your keyboard, with just a few keystrokes, by typing
abbreviations. Just type a few letters of what you are looking for and Key
Launch finds it - enter e.g. A'calcA' to open the A'calculatorA'.

You can add aliases, e.g. you can define that "w" means "Microsoft Word", and
from now on, you can simply hit Ctrl+Q, then A'wA' and enter to open MS Word,
itA's much faster than browsing through your start menu.
