As much as many people love Windows 7 Start Menu over Windows 8 Metro
interface, the fact is that the menu can become rather cluttered. Windows 7
Quick Application Launcher helps you create launchers you can use to quickly
access documents and applications you commonly use.

  * Imports nearly every detail in existing shortcuts 
  * Reads system icons for the registered icons and retrieves icons from PNG and ICO files, shortcuts and executable files 
  * A Task Bar Launcher can contain as many application launchers as the monitor screen can accommodate 
  * Supports drag and drop 
Windows 7 Quick Application Launcher is especially suited for enterprises that
make many custom applications and shortcuts containing extra parameters. It
does not ask for administrator rights to install, and each user can install it
on a computer.

**WhatA's new in version 1.5:**

  * added menu entry for calling help
