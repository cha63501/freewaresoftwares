**Publisher's Description**  
  


The CleanMem application was designed to be a very simple to operate as it will run and clean the memory out of all processes it can, without any user input. 

Some antivirus programs and such protect their processes so of course cleanmem canA't touch those.

The program will install and set it to run every 30 min via the windows task scheduler. Install it and your done! The program doesnA't run in the background, once it does its job it closes and doesnA't run again until the task scheduler runs it.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** Some of the features in the free version will work for 7 days, after which, will be disabled unless you upgrade to the Pro version.

**What's New in version 2.4.2:**

  * Cleaning of the File Cache is now disabled by default. There are times where cleaning it helps improve performance and sometimes it doesn't depending what the system is doing at the time. So best to let the user decide to have it enabled. 
  * Added a new menu option to the mini monitor to manually clean the file cache. This new option is part of the free and pro versions :-) 
  * CleanMem and all of its exe's are now terminal services aware.
