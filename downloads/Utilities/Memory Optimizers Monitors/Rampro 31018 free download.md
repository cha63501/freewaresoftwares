**Publisher's Description**  
  

RAMPro will empty out any free working space which was left behind from a
process. Basically each program requires RAM to run, it takes some space and
works with it. Sometimes a process doesnA't need that space any more but
doesnA't empty it again. RAMPro will automatically empty out the freed space
for you.

By default it will empty out all process every two seconds (this canA't be
changed), but by clicking "Select process" you are able to select a process
and empty out that one alone.

Minimizing RAMPro will send it to the tray, just click the icon once and it
will return.

**WhatA's New in version 3.1.0.18:**

**New:**

  * Themes - default, hackerish, light, aero, dark 
  * Set process affinity 
  * Set process priority - BEWARE OF REALTIME MODE
