**Publisher's Description**  
  

MemoryElevator is a great application for anyone that has a constant lack of
free physical memory even though they have more than 64MB of memory. This
happens because - by default - Windows is using all of the RAM as disk cache.

So, if you install a large program or just surf the web, your RAM will be
filled with more and more unnecessarily cached data! The MemoryElevator frees
memory when you need it and, if you want, it can work in the background. It
runs within the idle process of Windows and therefor it doesnA't steal your
processor time because it only get unused cpu time(for example when the
computer is waiting of the user like in 95% of all cases).
