**Publisher's Description**  
  

RAMpage displays available memory in an icon in the System Tray and can free
memory, either manually, (by double-clicking the icon), or automatically, (by
setting a minimum level that triggers the program). It can also be called from
a batch file or run in the background. The program itself uses very little
memory, (about 150K). It includes configuration and help screens, and
install/uninstall support.
