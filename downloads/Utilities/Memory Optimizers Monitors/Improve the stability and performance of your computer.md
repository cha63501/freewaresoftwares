**Publisher's Description**  
  


Datum Memory Booster does not run on the placebo memory optimization engine and will not force any memory out of your RAM (unless you use the Defrag option). It will however make a Windows API call that tells Windows to clean up the workspace of all processes thus freeing up any memory, processes no longer needs (Clear Processes Working Set). It will do this periodically to help improve the speed and the stability of your system. 

Keep in mind that this method will not free up a big amount of RAM, but instead will, as previously stated, improve the stability and performance of your computer. This will also cure memory leaks and in some cases has been able to unfreeze programs. Because it uses a Windows API call, you know that itAs safe to run.

**Note:** Defrag memory is an experimental function. It will force most of the memory into the Pagefile. In most cases, this is not a good thing, but could free a lot of RAM. You can try it and if it slows down your computer or cause programs to lock up simply reboot and everything should be fine.
