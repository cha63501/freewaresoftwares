**Publisher's Description**  
  

The RAMTester tool checks reliability of memory modules under MS Windows (x86
and x64), working with virtual addresses. It writes various bit patterns into
memory cells and then reads them and compares with reference. Note that the
check is qualitative, so you might want to use utilities working with real
addresses under DOS to obtain more quantitative data.
