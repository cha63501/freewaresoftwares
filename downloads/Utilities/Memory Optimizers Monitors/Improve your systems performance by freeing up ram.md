RamBooster monitors the amount of RAM your system is using and allows you to free it up. This will let your PC run smoother and faster, and you wonA't have to reboot as often. It will monitor your memory at all times, and if the amount of free RAM gets too low, it will automatically boost it for you, finding unused RAM and returning it to the free pool. RamBooster will also monitor your CPU usage. 

This version has many new improvements. An animated tray icon and pop-up message box have been added. Some bugs have been fixed, and many parts of the program have been totally rewritten.
