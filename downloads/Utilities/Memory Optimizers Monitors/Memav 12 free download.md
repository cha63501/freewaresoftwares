**Publisher's Description**  
  

MemAv can monitor your resources and will let you know in real time if your
available memory is still running or if it is time to close some windows, save
your work and reboot Windows before crashes occur.

MemAv will add a very discreet bar at the top of your computer screen. This
bar, originaly green, will change its color and become blue as the available
memory of your computer decreases. When its color turns red, it is time to
close some of the open programs or to reboot.
