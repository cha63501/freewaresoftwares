**Publisher's Description**  
  


This application runs in the background while you are working. Whenever you copy text to the clipboard, it strips off the formatting. That sounds very simple but it can save you a lot of time when pasting text between different applications (eg Word into Outlook) when all you want is the text to be inserted with the style of the destination app.
