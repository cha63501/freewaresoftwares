**Publisher's Description**  
  


Snippets is a simple (and free!) tool for storing pieces of text that you type in frequently. Examples include your email address, name, user IDA's, passwords, a standard rejection letter, you name it. The snippets you create can be selected from a list or accessed via hotkeys. 

Unlike the Windows clipboard, Snippets can store an unlimited number of items, each just a keystroke or mouse-click away.
