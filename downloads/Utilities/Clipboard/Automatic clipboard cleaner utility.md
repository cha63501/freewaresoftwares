**Publisher's Description**  
  


This small formless assembler-compiled applet of mere 3KB will automatically clear the Windows Clipboard when run. It doesnA't stay in memory and immediately terminates after its job is done. It takes less than a second to erase the contents of your Clipboard. It works silently and it doesnA't display any messages, it just does its work (if the Clipboard is already empty when it is run, then nothing happens). You may place an optional shortcut of this program into any Windows scheduler and configure it to be run when your PC becomes idle for a given amount of time or even run it simultaneously with your screen saver!
