**Publisher's Description**  
  

HovText is a small freeware and open source Windows application that removes
any formatting from the clipboard and it also works as a simple clipboard
manager. Any text in the clipboard will be pasted as raw text without any HTML
code, font size, color or layout etc. HovText remembers the last 10 copied
texts (both formatted and unformatted) and you can filter out whatever text
you need with regular expressions.

A typical scenario is to copy a quote from Internet Explorer and paste this
quote into Outlook or Word. In most cases it will paste the formatting along
also and that is often inconvenient as it spoils the current formatting. Some
applications have their own way of importing the unformatted text, but with
HovText ALL programs have this option and it works in the same way all the
time.

Another typical scenario is that you need to copy all email addresses on a
webpage or if you want to grep all movie links from a web-directory, then you
just apply a filter and paste this into eg. a WGET script or alike.
