**Publisher's Description**  
  

SnapShooter 2007 is a small freeware application that is able to capture an
image of the active window or screen directly to a file on your disk, rather
than having to manually fire up an image processing app and save it from the
clipboard yourself.  
  
**There must be a million applications like this, why choose SnapShooter?**  
  
Beyond its basic concept of capturing images, SnapShooter 2007 incorporates a
pluggable system that allows for plugins that may alter the images after
capture. Examples may be automatically applying a watermark, altering the
colors, e-mail the image, print it etc. SnapShooter also supports multiple
monitors among other things.  
  
You could for example configure SnapShooter 2007 to capture the active window
for you, make it grayscale and put a copyright watermark text in the lower
right corner and then upload it to ImageShack.us for you, returning the link
to the image - automatically each time you press a defined hotkey!

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
