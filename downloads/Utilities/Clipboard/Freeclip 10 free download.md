**Publisher's Description**  
  

FreeClip is the convenient clipboard manager. For certain, each user have
faced the problem when it is necessary to create data arrays (of any
structure), which include repeating fragments of the data. In this case you
should use the standard Windows clipboard that allows you to keep a fragment
of the data from any editor and then to use (paste) this fragment in the same
or other program.

Imagine that you need to make the document for which initial data are already
done. You need to copy a part of the pre-created information, and paste it.
Then you copy the second fragment and insert in it. And if you need to paste
first fragment again? You should to switch to the first fragment and copy it
again. With FreeClip it is not necessary to do these superfluous actions.

This clipboard manager allows you to copy simultaneously up to 4 (!) blocks of
the various data and provides fast methods to get access to those 4 data
buffers. Besides FreeClip can save its clipboards content on to your hard disk
at program exit and automatically load it at the next startup. It works
similar to the system clipboard.
