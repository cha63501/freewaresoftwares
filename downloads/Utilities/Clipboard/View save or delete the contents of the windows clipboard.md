**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is the second version of Clipboard Recovery. The interface has been remodeled, and the software now supports the two most commonly used clipboard formats: Graphics and Text. 

The software works by adding itself to the clipboard viewer chain. When the clipboard is updated, the software saves the current content to a temporary file. Users have the option to preview previous clipboard items or set previous items back to the clipboard.
