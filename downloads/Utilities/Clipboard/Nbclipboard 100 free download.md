**Publisher's Description**  
  

nbClipboard adds stack, queue and simple text transformations to the Windows
clipboard when using the clipboardA's keyboard shortcuts.

As well as storing successive clipboard items in either a queue or a stack
nbClipboard can perform search/replace operations on the clipboard data and
can automatically convert the text to either upper or lower case.

This tool can be left running in the background or you can make the window
stay on top or become transparent.

It is necessary to have the .NET framework version 3.0 installed for
nbClipboard to work. Version 3.0 of the framework is pre-installed on Windows
Vista and can be downloaded from MicrosoftA's website as an additional
download for Windows XP.
