**Publisher's Description**  
  

This lightweight and easy to use utility does only one job - it monitors the
clipboard. Each time you copy text or images to the clipboard the program
saves it as file. You can save text fragments from the clipboard in text, html
and rich text (rtf) formats HTML and RTF formats allow to keep formatting of
source text. While RTF format is selected you can save text and images in the
single file. Images can be saved in BMP, JPG, PNG and GIF formats.
