  * Drag&Drop - You can also drag and drop text from/to MiniCLIP if you like from any compatible D&D application. 
  * In fact you can even drag and drop files (multiple too) into MiniCLIP and you will get a perfect list of the files with full path in your clipboard (and also MiniCLIP box). This is quite interesting feature! 
  * Task Bar MiniCLIP - You can put the MiniCLIP into the task Bar. 
  * It is simple, just right click on the icon in Tray and from menu select S/H Task Bar. 
  * This will create another small MiniCLIP in the task Bar with the same functionality of its bigger brother.
