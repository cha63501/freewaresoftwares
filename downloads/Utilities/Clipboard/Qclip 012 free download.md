**Publisher's Description**  
  

QClip is a simple clipboard enhancement that allows Windows users to paste
text that was clipped earlier. You never have to think about QClip, but when
you want to paste something that you clipped a while ago instead of CTRL-V,
just press CTRL-ALT-V and QClip will appear with all of your old clips. You
can use the arrow keys to select the item you want, then press "Enter", or use
the mouse and click the "Paste" button. QClip only stores plain text clips,
and the history is cleared when you reboot or exit QClip.
