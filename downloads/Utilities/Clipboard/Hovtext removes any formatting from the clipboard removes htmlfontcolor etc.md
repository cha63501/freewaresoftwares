**Publisher's Description**  
  


HovText is a small freeware and open source Windows application that removes any formatting from the clipboard. That means the text will be pasted as raw text without any HTML code, font size, color or layout etc. A typical scenario is to copy a qoute from Internet Explorer and paste this quote into Outlook or Word. In the most cases it will paste the formatting along also and that is often inconvenient as it spoils the current formatting.
