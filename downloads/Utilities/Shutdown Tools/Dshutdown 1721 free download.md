**Publisher's Description**  
  

DShutdown (DimioA's Shutdown) is a stand-alone program that let you schedule
the shutdown of a local or remote PC.

It supports, beyond classical shutdown options, also a series of particular
options relating "pure" shutdown (as the "force after wait" option, that
causes a forced, but "clear", shutdown), and relating monitor functions (as
the option to shutdown a PC when an application terminate, useful at the end
of compression of several files, or as the option to shutdown a PC when
Internet traffic reduces itself under a particular value for a given amount of
time, useful to shutdown a PC at the end of a download).

Is also possible to intercept a shutdown request caused by the user (or by
another software) and to execute the shutdown request with selected options in
DShutdown (this can be useful, for example, to shutdown all LANA's PCs at the
shutdown of a server).
