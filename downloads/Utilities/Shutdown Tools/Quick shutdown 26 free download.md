**Publisher's Description**  
  

Quick ShutDown is a free Windows shutdown utility that allows the user to
shutdown, reboot or logoff your Windows session with a mouse click.

When Quick ShutDown is running, an accurate miniature icon appears on the
taskbar on the end opposite the Start button (next to the clock). Right-click
on the icon and you have a choice to shutdown, reboot or logoff your Windows
session. You can preset a command so that all you need to do is to left click
on its icon in the desktray and that function will be carried out.

Quick ShutDown optionally terminates programs that are not responding, making
shutdowns both quicker and safer. You can easily set hotkeys for each task
(shutdown, reboot and logoff). Quick ShutDown works with Windows
95/98/ME/XP/NT/2000.
