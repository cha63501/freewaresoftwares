A "Sleep" timer for your computer. Automated Shutdown, Restart, Log Off,
Standby, and Hibernate Windows functions in a user friendly, menu-driven
program.

Below are the simple steps of using this program:

  1. Select a Function 
  2. Choose an Execution Method 
  3. Enter Your Desired Time You Want PC Sleep to Perform the Function 
  4. Save Your Work 
  5. Click Start 
After following these steps, you can leave your computer and PC Sleep will
safely perform the selected function in the entered amount of time with no
effort on your part. Bundled with force function files which allow for
recurring actions every day, week, or month. A noticeable pop-up window will
appear when there is one minute left on the timer. The same window will pop-up
if no time is selected; giving you 30 seconds to stop the timer before PC
Sleep executes the selected function.

This utility is particularly good for long downloads where you would like your
computer to shut down after a certain amount of hours, playing music before
you go to bed, or any other reason you might need PC Sleep to perform its
functions while youA're away from your computer.
