**Publisher's Description**  
  


SmartPower is a Windows service that saves energy (and money) by hibernating and resuming your Windows PC according to configurable rules. 

SmartPower is particularly suited to Windows Home Servers, torrent/download boxes and HTPCs.

SmartPowerA's "goal" is to hibernate (or suspend, or shutdown) your PC. The SmartPower configuration utility lets you create rules that prevent this happening. When SmartPower sees that no rules currently apply it will initiate hibernate (or suspend, or shutdown). The potential rules are:

  * One or more schedules are active - A schedule is a period of time during which the PC must stay on. By default SmartPower will wake-up your PC in order to honour a schedule. 
  * One or more devices are online - A device is anything on your network that will respond to a ping. 
  * Network throughput (the bytes flowing through a particular interface) is above a configurable threshold. 
  * CPU usage is above a configurable threshold. 
  * One or more processes are running - A process is a Windows process. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
