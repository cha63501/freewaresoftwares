Would you like to schedule or automate some tasks on your computer? A handy
application you can use for such a purpose is known as PShutDown. Although you
can use the small program to shut down your computer, this is just one of the
things it can do.

The tasks you can schedule include:

  * Shutting down computer 
  * Rebooting 
  * Loging off 
  * Switching off monitor 
  * Activating sleeping mode 
  * Running alarm 
  * Running Program 
  * Showing message 

The application allows you to schedule desired tasks in three ways:

  * After a specified duration in days, hours, minutes and/or seconds 
  * At a particular time, i.e. day of the week, hours, minutes and/or seconds 
  * Recurrent, in hours, minutes and/or minutes 

Alternatively, you can press the DoIt button to perform the selected task
immediately.

PShutDown is a small and simple application that does a great job of
scheduling or automating some tasks on a computer. It includes a beeper that
you can activate to warn you when a scheduled task is about activate.
