**Publisher's Description**  
  


Shutdown Scheduler (SDS) is a utility allowing to automate shutting the system down or closing specified applications. It is also able to break a modem connection, restart or hibernate the system or even put it to standby mode. 

Many options make the program highly customizable for your particular needs, for example, condition under which the program will perform specified action: at given time, after specified period elapses, after the computer is idle for specified amount of time or a specified application is closed.

You can even combine the conditions (not directly, though, but it is possible - read the help file) and whichever occurs first, triggers the action.

Despite the number of options, the program is really easy to use.

**What's New in version 2.44:**

  * Windows 7 support added. 
  * Some cosmetic's changes: new menu icon, upper part of window by Aero Glass (if supported by system), new refresh icon. 
  * Bug fixed: 
    * Changes in Advanced Settings weren't saved as long as you didn't click Begin button. 
    * (Un)Installer couldn't start, when some instance of SDS had been running.
