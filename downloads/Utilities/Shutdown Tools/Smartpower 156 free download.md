**Publisher's Description**  
  

SmartPower is a Windows service that saves energy (and money) by hibernating
and resuming your Windows PC according to configurable rules.

SmartPower is particularly suited to Windows Home Servers, torrent/download
boxes and HTPCs.

SmartPowerA's "goal" is to hibernate (or suspend, or shutdown) your PC. The
SmartPower configuration utility lets you create rules that prevent this
happening. When SmartPower sees that no rules currently apply it will initiate
hibernate (or suspend, or shutdown). The potential rules are:

  * One or more schedules are active - A schedule is a period of time during which the PC must stay on. By default SmartPower will wake-up your PC in order to honour a schedule. 
  * One or more devices are online - A device is anything on your network that will respond to a ping. 
  * Network throughput (the bytes flowing through a particular interface) is above a configurable threshold. 
  * CPU usage is above a configurable threshold. 
  * One or more processes are running - A process is a Windows process. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
