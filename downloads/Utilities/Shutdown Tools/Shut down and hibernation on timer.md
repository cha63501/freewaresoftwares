**Publisher's Description**  
  


This utility will be very handy for people who would like to leave their computer unattended for some time before automatically turning it off. TOff can turn off your computer (or hibernate, when possible) at a certain day and time, with the seconds discrepancy. I use it every time when I leave my computer at the office to download some stuff from the Internet and then to turn it off at night so that it looked like nothing was happening in the morning. 

Special features: 

  * Can shutdown almost every Windows operating system that has Advanced Power Management (APM) enabled (Check Control Panel -> Power Options) 
  * Any system that supports hibernation can be hibernated on time (i.e., switching off your computer without closing running programs) 
  * Provides the log for the last operation (so that you can check if shut-off occurred in time) 
Requires APM support, also hibernation enabled.
