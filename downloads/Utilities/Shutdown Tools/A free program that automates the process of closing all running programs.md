**Publisher's Description**  
  


SmartClose is a free program that automates the process of closing all running programs. It can also save the state of the system to a system snapshot, so all the programs that have been closed can be easily restarted later by SmartClose. 

**Features:**

  * Two wizards: the Close Programs wizard, for closing all the programs, and the Restore wizard, to restore a system snapshot. Both provide an intuitive and clear interface, and assist you step by step. 
  * Thanks to its SmartClose-technology, most programs can be properly closed, so that the program can still save its settings and return memory and resources to the system. 
  * In the rare cases that a program canA't be properly closed, SmartClose can use SmartKill to kill the program. Still, all the memory and resources used by the program will be freed. 
  * If you donA't want a program to be closed or killed by SmartClose, you can add it to a list of A'Protected ProgramsA'. 
  * Besides closing programs, SmartClose also closes Explorer and Internet Explorer windows and saves their current location, so they can be restored properly later. 
  * Disables and restores the screen saver. 
  * On modern Windows versions, SmartClose stops and restarts Windows services that can interrupt other processes, such as the Task Scheduler. On Windows 9x/Millennium, the Task Scheduler can also be disabled and re-enabled. 
  * And finally, you get all of these features for free. SmartClose is 100% freeware without any nag screens, trial periods, ads, spyware etc. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.3:**

  * Fixed: in some cases, SmartClose didn't save the closed/killed programs to the system snapshot. 
  * Fixed: after running the Close Programs wizard more than once in the same SmartClose instance, the closed/killed programs and stopped services didn't get saved to the system snapshot correctly anymore.
