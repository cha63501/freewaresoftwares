**Publisher's Description**  
  


Shutdown Monitor uses a fairly simple trick (think jediAish, Athis is not the shutdown youAre looking forA ) to prevent the user from inadvertently shutting down their computer. 

After you start Shutdown monitor, it tells windows that it was one of the first programs that was started on the PC, so it will be the first notified if a user initiates a shutdown, reboot, log off etc. When it receives the shutdown notification it checks to see if the program you donA't want the user to interrupt is still running, if it is, it pops up a msg box and tells the user why they canA't shutdown and halts the shutdown process.

To Prevent the computer from shutting down while XP SP2 is installing use the following - c:\> "shutdown monitor.exe" update.exe

When the install is finished use the following to remove shutdown monitor from memory - c:\> "shutdown monitor.exe" quit

This program has been tested on and is intended for use on Microsoft Windows W2K and XP, Hope someone else finds it useful.
