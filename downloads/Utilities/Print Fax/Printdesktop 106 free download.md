**Publisher's Description**  
  

PrintDeskTop lets you print the exact contents of your screen with the click
of a mouse or the shortcut key of your choice. Without PrintDeskTop, itA's
nearly impossible for the average user to print their screen. With
PrintDeskTop, you donA't have to capture your screen image before printing it;
you simply click the Windows Start button followed by the PrintDeskTop icon.

Or, if you prefer, assign a shortcut key of your choice and use it to print
your screen. Print only what you need. How many times have you had to print
countless pages from a web site or whatever, only to throw away all but the
one you wanted? And best of all, PrintDeskTop is free!

**What's New in version 1.06:**

  * Landscape printing support added. Click Start->All Programs->PrintDeskTop->PrintDeskTop (landscape) to print your screen in landscape. 
  * New installer (Inno Setup) making download size smaller.
