**Publisher's Description**  
  

The F-Secure Uninstallation Tool is an application that will safely remove
F-Secure Service Platform 5.x, 6.x, F-Secure Anti-Virus and F-Secure Internet
Security 2005, 2006, 2007 from workstations where executed upon.

It is recommended that you use this uninstallation tool only if the regular
uninstallation methods fail!

**Removing by using F-Secure uninstallation tool**

The F-Secure uninstallation tool should be used with extreme care, and there
are several caveats to its use:

  * The tool will not remove F-Secure software if it was installed directly into an unsafe location, such as c:\, c:\windows or c:\program files. This is because it will delete the directory into which F-Secure was installed and, as such, it would also delete the rest of the files. 
  * The tool will remove all installed F-Secure products, and should therefore be used with extreme caution on F-Secure Policy Manager / F-Secure Anti-Virus for Microsoft Exchange / F-Secure Anti-Virus for Windows Server installations. Running the uninstallation tool on a Policy Manager server without a backup means that you will have to reinstall all clients.
