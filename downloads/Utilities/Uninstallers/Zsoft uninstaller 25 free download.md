**Publisher's Description**  
  

ZSoft Uninstaller is the better and easier way to uninstall programs on your
computer. ZSoft Uninstaller can be used as a Add/Remove applet replacement,
but not only that, it can also:

  * Analyze an installation so it can be completely uninstalled (also supports reboots of the computer as the process is split into two: Before and after the installation) 
  * Search for leftovers after uninstalling a program 
  * Cleanup in the programs starting on your computer at startup 
  * Find and delete temporary files 
  * Find and delete empty folders 
  * Delete entries from programs that are no longer installed 
  * Hide Windows Updates 
  * Hide entries from the list that you are never going to uninstall (drivers etc.) making the list smaller and therefore easier to manage. 
  * Show more information than available though add/remove 
  * Automatically find entries from programs that are most likely already uninstalled 
  * Automatically find entries that are considered "crap-ware" 
  * (Off course) search the list of installed software
