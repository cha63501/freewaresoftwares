**Publisher's Description**  
  

PUI (aka Program Uninstallation Information) is a small utility that has been
developed with the sole intention of allowing users to view and modify the
uninstall string for installed programs without having to enter the registry,
and additionally allow simple removal of such programs from a simple to use
interface.

PUI additionally identifies programs that cannot be uninstalled, and lets you
know if this is the case, without the need for extra long hours spent looking
on authors homepages, just to be told "you canA't remove it".

As an added bonus, PUI has been setup to detect certain spyware and adware
components and let you know if these are installed, and if applicable, remove
them, without having to call in the big boyA's (although, it is always
reccomended to keep your Antivirus and Anti-spyware software uptodate, and to
run a scan on your system on a daily basis, just incase).

IMPORTANT: Although PUI is able to detect certain malware, it is NOT an anti-
malware application and thus, should not be treated as such.
