**Publisher's Description**  
  

RemoteRemoveIE is a utility that can uninstall IE10 and IE11 from computers
remotely on a network.

If you want to uninstall IE from the machine you are on, you should leave the
Machine Name as localhost and blank out the Admin Username and Admin Password
and click the button that matches the IE version that you want to remove.

If you want to remove IE from a remote machine, then you need to enter either
the remote machine DNS name or IP address and you must also ensure that you
enter a local or domain administrator username and password into the correct
boxes. If you are using a domain administrator account, then please remember
to enter the domain into your username, for example: TGHadministrator - do not
just enter administrator. Once you are happy with your data entry, click the
button that matches the version of IE that you want to remove.

RemoteRemoveIE will then connect to the remote machine using the credentials
that you have provided and uninstall Internet Explorer. When this has
completed, next time the remote machine is rebooted, it will complete the
uninstall of IE and put the previous version back on it (for example, Internet
Explorer 9).
