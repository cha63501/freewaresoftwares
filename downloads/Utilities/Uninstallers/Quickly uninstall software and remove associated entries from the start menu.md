**Publisher's Description**  
  


By placing a shortcut to Uninstaller on your desktop, or on a toolbar, you can quickly uninstall software in just a few clicks. 

The program can display orphaned installations, and allows you to delete them from the system registry (with undo if necessary!). It will also display system components which have been installed. The list can be sorted and filtered to show only normal installations.

You can quickly find an application by either typing in the name of the application (partial entries are allowed, e.g. AadoA will find AAdobeA), or you can press the ASA to jump to applications beginning with ASA.
