Have you ever struggled to uninstall programs you no longer wanted in your computer? If you have used your computer for a while, then there are high chances that you have installed a variety of programs, some of which you no longer or hardly use. Some programs may prove difficult to uninstall, and even the ones you uninstall often leave traces that slow down your system. This makes it important to have a better uninstaller than the native program that comes with Windows, which is where Wise Program Uninstaller comes in. 

**Features**

**Thorough Program Removal:** Wise Program Uninstaller can use force uninstall to remove broken and stubborn programs. It uses an advanced program search algorithm to find leftovers that remain after uninstalling programs so they can be removed.

**Using Different Methods:** This free program uninstaller can use the safe uninstall that the native uninstaller uses to remove programs normally. However, when it becomes difficult to uninstall some programs using this method, it uses forced uninstall to remove the stubborn programs.

**Repairing Programs:** In spite of its name, Wise Program Uninstaller does not only help in uninstalling programs. You can also use it to repair some programs you want but do not function properly. Some of the programs you can repair include Adobe and Office.

**Using Wise Program Uninstaller**

The programAs user interface displays only basic metrics and other options, so it does not appear cluttered. On the left of the program window are buttons for: 

  * Safe Uninstall 
  * Repair Programs 
  * Forced Uninstall 
  * Remove Entries 
A larger portion of the window is covered by details of the installed programs, including: 
  * Name 
  * Publisher 
  * Size 
  * Installation Date 
  * Version 

We were pleased to see the total number of programs installed and the disk space they took displayed below these details. The uninstaller displayed the current version and provided a link for checking updates at the bottom of the window. It also included a menu button next to the minimize button with the search bar located beneath them. Relevant programs started appearing as soon as we started typing names in the search bar.

Once we had uninstalled a program, the uninstaller started analyzing associated files, folders and registry entries. It displayed the results and gave us the option to remove some or all of the entries to clean leftovers. Right-clicking on a program provided the option to open it in the registry editor or perform a Google search. However, only advanced users should use the RegEditor.

**Conclusion**

If you want to restore the snappy performance of your computer, then you need to remove process-hogging and other bloated programs that you do not really need. Unfortunately, the native Windows uninstaller tends to leave some leftovers that still affect performance. Wise Program Uninstaller is a free program uninstaller that will help you remove programs completely and easily, including the stubborn ones.
