**Publisher's Description**  
  


If you have installed Windows 8, then you have noticed that it comes with some apps already pre-installed. However, it is likely that you do not use some of these apps and would like to uninstall them. Win 8 App Remover provides a graphical user interface for the native Windows "dism.exe," a 64-bit executable for a command line application, which does not have a GUI. 

**Features:**

  * Mounts and unmounts WIM images 
  * Lists integrated and installed Metro apps 
  * Removes unwanted apps 

The application provides a list of all installed apps and the ability to remove the ones you do not want. Once you have mounted WIM files and chosen the mount folder, removing unwanted Metro apps is as easy as selecting them from the list and then clicking the ARemove AppsA button. You can also use it to remove Bing tools that you do not intend to use.

Win 8 App Remover is a Desktop, not Metro, UI application.
