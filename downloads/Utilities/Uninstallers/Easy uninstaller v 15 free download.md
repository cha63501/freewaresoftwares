**Publisher's Description**  
  

Easy uninstaller is a fast, advanced, powerful, and easy to use replacement
for slow, and user unfriendly windows Add/Remove control panel applet, apart
from providing you with a view advantage over default windows Add/Remove
applet, it displays the additional information with clickable URLs (if
available).

In addition, it allows you to perform multiple uninstalls in a row - just
check all the software that you want to remove and the program will
automatically launch the next uninstaller after the previous has finished.
This really comes in handy if you download a lot of softwareA's or use monthly
software CDA's which will end up in a lot of unneeded softwareA's you had
tried and want to clean up.

It also offers an option to backup your uninstall list, and to remove items
from the list, if they are corrupt. Easy uninstaller provides a total solution
for the uninstalling task.

Main Features Include:

  * 5-10 times faster than windows Add/Remove applet  

  * Provides function like Uninstall list Backup Manager and Obsolete key deletion.  

  * Displays detailed information of the application.  

  * Has a very pleasant, easy to use user-interface. 
  * Select many applications and uninstall them in one go (One after another), very handy for cleaning your computer from unwanted applications.
