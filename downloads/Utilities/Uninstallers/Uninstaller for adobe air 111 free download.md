**Publisher's Description**  
  

Uninstaller for Adobe AIR is an easy solution for uninstalling Adobe AIR
applications.  
  
When installing an AIR application it is possible to first save the
installation program file (. air). This file will then allow to install but
also to uninstall the application, provided that the AIR engine is installed
and functional.  
  
If you install an AIR application from its source without saving its
installation program file, or if the AIR engine is not available, uninstalling
an AIR application can be difficult on a GNU/Linux system because it requires
the use of system commands via a shell.  
  
Thanks to Uninstaller for Adobe AIR it becomes very easy to uninstall an AIR
application since it suffices to choose it from a list of installed
applications and click on an Uninstall button.  
  
Uninstaller for Adobe AIR is a free software under GPL version 3 license,
designed to be compatible with the GNU/Linux Debian and Ubuntu distributions,
and with the GNOME and KDE window managers.

The 64-Bit version of Uninstaller for Adobe AIR is also [available for
download](http://blogs.media-tips.com/bernard.opic/downloads/uninstaller-for-
adobe-air_1.1.1_amd64.deb).
