**Publisher's Description**  
  


A utility for backing up and synchronizing collections of files on two different computers, just like the Windows Briefcase. But in comparison to the Windows Briefcase, Briefcase Plus has the following advantages: 

  * only modified files are ported to the briefcase. The briefcase retains the last time it was updated, and loads only files that have been changed since that time. 
  * the briefcase contents are compressed. This lets you take 100% to 500% more data on a briefcase. 
  * the files you work on will always be on the local hard disk (and not on a floppy disk), and will only be copied to the briefcase when you load the briefcase. So accessing these files will be much faster. 
Typically, you can use Briefcase Plus for synchronization between your computer at work and your computer at home, or between your desktop and your portable. You will work on one computer, then load the briefcase (with your modified files), and take it to the second computer. There, you will unload the briefcase, updating all these files on this second computer. Then you can work on this second computer, and load the briefcase again afterwards.
