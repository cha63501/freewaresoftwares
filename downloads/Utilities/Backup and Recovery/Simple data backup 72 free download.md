**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free, easy, and efficient backup software! It can back up folders/files from
one drive to another anytime you want on-demand (including with an optional
direct shortcut on your desktop to run the backup), on a timed schedule, or at
logon.

Back up to another hard drive, flash drive, network drive, CD/DVD (if packet-
writing software is installed) and more. It can create identical folder/file
structures on the backup drive, or can compress the data as .ZIP or LZMA-
compressed .7z files.

It can back up "in use" files, monitor and alert you to any errors, and it
automatically handles the whole full/incremental backup thing that other
programs make you deal with. Simple Data Backup is indeed simple - just pick
the folders you want to be backed up and a few settings and youA're done!
