AceBackup is a powerful tool to create completely secure backups of your data.
Store your data on any local storage device, on CD, DVD or on your remote FTP
server!

A special advantage of AceBackup is the possibility to backup single files and
groups of files, for example for important or confidential documents. The
program can also store different versions of your files. This can be useful if
you would like to restore a certain version of your file at a later date.

On demand the program does not only encrypt the content of your files but also
the file name to ensure completely secure backups in any case.

AceBackup has five different encryption algorithms to protect your data
against unauthorized access.

Smart Restore restores your backups quickly and easily, three integrated
compression levels allow you to choose between quick or smallest backup files!
Detailed reports and a detailed help as well as a number of wizards complete
the excellent functions.

  * Create a new AceBackup project. 
  * Select the files and folders you wish to back up. 
  * Define the security settings. 
  * Define the target of backup. 
  * Done!
