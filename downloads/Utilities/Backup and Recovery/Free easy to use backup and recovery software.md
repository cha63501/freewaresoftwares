It is important to back up your data regularly to prevent possible loss. It is equally important to use the right software that works easily and ensures the safety of the data backed up. If you are looking for a program that can perform complete data backups with just a single click, then you should consider Aomei Data Backupper. 

You can use Aomei Data Backupper to perform three main types of backups, namely:

**System Backup**

Both boot and system files must be in order for an operating system to function well. Aomei Data Backupper allows you to back up both types of files to ensure normal operation after a restore. This is especially important when using Windows 7 and later operating systems that separate boot and system partitions. 

**Partition Backup**

Each computer has at least one partition, which is normally known as the C Drive. A hard drive can be divided into several partitions that function as separate drives, which are generally used to store different types of data. Users can choose to back up individual partitions instead of entire hard drives, and Aomei Data Backupper packages all content of the chosen partition into one image file.

Partition backup is quite useful when dealing with many computers using the same hardware configuration. The operating system can be installed in one computer and backed up. The image file can then be used to "restore" the OS into remaining computers, which helps to save time significantly. 

**Disk Backup**

This process involves backing up all data on a disk, including the OS and installed programs. Aomei Data Backupper can be used to back even external hard drives and disks using different types of storage technology, such as GPT, MBR and RAID.

In addition to restoring files, disk data backup can help in upgrading hard disks from small to large, old to new or damaged to good.

**Features**

Aomei Data Backupper includes several other features apart from the functions already mentioned, including: 

  * Volume and partition cloning 
  * The ability to perform differential and incremental backups 
  * The ability to add comments 
  * Compression and encryption 
  * Splitting backup files 
  * Creating bootable rescue media, which may be on either USB drive or CD/DVD 
  * Verifying integrity of stored images 
  * Deleting unwanted images 
  * Displaying target location on a disk map 

The intuitive user interface does not only look nice but is also easy to use. It eliminates chances of confusion by including only essential menus. 

**How Aomei Data Backupper Works**

Aomei Data Backupper packages content into image files. Users just need to select their targets, define storage location and perform the backup. The program can compress the images to take as little space as possible. 

**Pros**

  * Easy installation process and simplicity of use 
  * Back up all data in a hard drive with one click 
  * Incremental backup improves backup efficiency and minimizes storage space 
  * The backup process can be performed while working on other things 

**Cons**

  * Cannot be used with individual folders or files 

How much will you pay for this excellent software? Nothing.
