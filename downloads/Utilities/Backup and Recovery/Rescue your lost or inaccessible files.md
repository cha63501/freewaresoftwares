MISPBO Data Recovery will help you rescue your lost or inaccessible files from any imaginable data recovery disaster. 

MISPBO Data Recovery works by analyzing your disk on a bit-by-bit level. This means it sees things that regular Windows programs canA't. It then uses itA's built-in intelligence to spot deleted files... and then attempts to recover them, so you can work with them as normal.

MISPBO Data Recovery works with practically all disks currently in use. As a general guide, if you can see it in Windows Explorer, you can use it with Undelete NOW! - including FAT 12/16/32 and NTFS (including compressed and encrypted) partitions.
