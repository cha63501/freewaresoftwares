**Publisher's Description**  
  

Clonezilla is a partition or disk clone tool similar to Norton GhostA(r). It
saves and restores only used blocks in hard drive. Two types of Clonezilla are
available, Clonezilla live and Clonezilla SE (Server Edition).

Clonezilla, based on DRBL, Partition Image, ntfsclone, partclone, and udpcast,
allows you to do bare metal backup and recovery. Clonezilla live is suitable
for single machine backup and restore. While Clonezilla SE is for massive
deployment, it can clone many (40 plus!) computers simultaneously. Clonezilla
saves and restores only used blocks in the harddisk. This increases the clone
efficiency. At the NCHCA's Classroom C, Clonezilla SE was used to clone 41
computers simultaneously. It took only about 10 minutes to clone a 5.6 GBytes
system image to all 41 computers via multicasting!

**Features:**

  * Free (GPL) Software. 
  * Filesystem supported: ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs, xfs, jfs of GNU/Linux, FAT, NTFS of MS Windows, and HFS+ of Mac OS. Therefore you can clone GNU/Linux, MS windows and Intel-based Mac OS, no matter itA's 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x86-64) OS. For these file systems, only used blocks in partition are saved and restored. For unsupported file system, sector-to-sector copy is done by dd in Clonezilla. 
  * LVM2 (LVM version 1 is not) under GNU/Linux is supported. 
  * Multicast is supported in Clonezilla SE, which is suitable for massively clone. You can also remotely use it to save or restore a bunch of computers if PXE and Wake-on-LAN are supported in your clients. 
  * Based on Partimage, ntfsclone, partclone, and dd to clone partition. However, clonezilla, containing some other programs, can save and restore not only partitions, but also a whole disk. 
  * By using another free software drbl-winroll, which is also developed by us, the hostname, group, and SID of cloned MS windows machine can be automatically changed. 

**Note:** This download is the Clonezilla Live ISO file suitable for single machine backup and restore. Users must burn the image to CD/DVD or mount the image using Virtual CD/DVD Software.
