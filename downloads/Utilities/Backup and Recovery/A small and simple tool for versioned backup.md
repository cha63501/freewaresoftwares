**Publisher's Description**  
  


File History is a small and simple tool for versioned backup. You select a set of files and can then save a snapshot of these files whenever you want. 

A complete file history consists of only two files. One contains a link to the selected files and one contains the snapshots. A specially designed compression and binary compare algorithm are used to save the snapshots as efficient as possible.
