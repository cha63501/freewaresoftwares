**Publisher's Description**  
  


@MAX SyncUp is a handy, feature-rich tool for backing up and synchronizing data on a local network or over the Internet. 

@MAX SyncUp provides a wide range of destinations for your backups, including USB-portable devices, elsewhere in your local network, (S)FTP or WebDAV-servers, or Google Drive cloud storage.

@MAX SyncUp allows you to execute various backup-strategies. Particularly, you can create backups in Apple Time Machine style with the use of hard links, allowing you to keep versions of the same files at different dates. This combines the facilities of a full backup with the effectiveness of an incremental backup.

You can also back up and synchronize data between two computers directly using the RSync-like algorithm, which detects and transfers only the changed parts of files, reducing data traffic and transfer time. The data is encrypted and transferred from one computer to another without any intermediaries, and is not kept in cloud storage. Consequently, there is no threat of unauthorized access to your information. In addition, synchronization without intermediaries helps you to save money; you do not have to pay a cloud storage fee. @MAX SyncUp synchronizes your computers quickly and effectively. Simply having an Internet connection is enough to keep your data up-to-date.

@MAX SyncUp is also exceptionally easy to use; the step-by-step setup wizard guides you through the whole configuration process. The program provides you with the ability to browse the contents of backup archives, perform quick file searches, and restore files in a few clicks.

There are many powerful features for advanced users, such as the smart filter system for selecting files, the ability to start the program as a Windows service, the option to copy ACL, etc.

With @MAX SyncUp, your data will be saved reliably and synchronized effectively, while minimizing time and data traffic.

Free for personal, non-commercial use.
