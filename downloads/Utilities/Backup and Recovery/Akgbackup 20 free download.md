**Publisher's Description**  
  

AKGBackup is a multi-platform compatible backup program that is written
entirely in Java. It is a utility for backing up your files, with an option to
compress data, on a different hard disk drive, floppies, different partition
of the same disk drive or any media an operating system can write to. After
the first run, subsequent runs are blazingly fast as only the changed or new
files are backed up. It can also create a specified number of backups so that
one can have older as well as newer backups.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
