As much as backing up data on a computer is important, many people forget
doing this on a regular basis. It is therefore important to have a program
that can help you perform automatic backups. A good application you can use to
do this is known as FBackup.

This free backup software uses a wizard that helps you set up your backups
easily.

**The wizard will guide you into choosing:**

  * The files you want to back up 
  * Where you want to back up the files 
  * How you would like the backup to run 
  * When you want the files backed up 

**FBackup Features**

  * Performs automatic backups 
  * Allows users to define actions to be performed after backup 
  * The ability to back up open files 
  * Ability to archive backups using standard zip compression or store exact copies 
  * Can store backups in multiple locations 
  * Uses plugins to back up and restore custom data and specific program settings 
  * Multi-language 
  * Free for both personal and commercial uses 

**Installing and Using FBackup**

At first, we wondered how such a tiny application could perform all that the
publisher said, but we discovered that the 1.1MB EXE file we downloaded was a
web installer for the MSI installation file.

FBackupAs interface was divided into three main areas:

  * Tabs and toolbars for performing various functions at the top 
  * Jobs section on the left where we could choose all jobs, running jobs or failed ones 
  * Space on the right where details of selected jobs appeared 

We could start a new backup by either clicking the New Backup button or
pressing ACtrl + N.A Once we had done that, the wizard asked us where we
wanted to store our backup. One of the things we immediately liked about the
program is that it allowed us to store our backups on local partitions,
something that the native Windows program does not allow. We then went to the
third step where we chose how we wanted the program to run the backup process.
Additionally, we could choose when we wanted the program to backup up data
automatically.

_Please note that you can only store exact copies of files or perform a mirror
backup if you are not doing a full backup._

**Conclusion**

We did not find any difficulty using FBackup. However, the free backup
software did not give us any idea about how long a backup would take. Overall,
it is a great tool for performing backups, something that every computer owner
must take seriously.
