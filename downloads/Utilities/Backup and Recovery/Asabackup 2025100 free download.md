**Publisher's Description**  
  

AsaBackup is a file backup application, which schedules and copies your items
A'as isA' to a location of your choice. Its main uses range from scheduling a
default group of items to backup, to setting multiple items as scheduled tasks
to backup. Your files are never distorted from their original format(s),
meaning they are not compressed or converted to different storage file
formats.

Use it for backing up and maintaining copies of original files in different
locations, so that when you change a file or update a file you can always find
a copy of the original item to a specific date. Folders with multiple files
and sub directories can also be scheduled for backups in the same manner.

Set up your tasks for a daily, weekly, or bi-weekly cycle. Even if you turn
off your machine before a backup has occurred, the next time you start your
computer the backup will continue.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
