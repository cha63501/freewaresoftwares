**Publisher's Description**  
  


Although you may copy files from your SD card to a computer without using any third-party software, this does not give you an exact copy of your card. If you would like to create an image of your SD card, then consider using WinSDCard, which is meant for creating raw disk images. 

This gives you a convenient way of backing up your SD card so that you can later restore the content in the exact way. You will restore your card to its original state without making any modifications. You can also use the small application to write a bootable image that you can use to install a new version of operating system on your mobile device.

**WinSDCard has three main functions:**

  * Creating image file of an SD card 
  * Copying image file to memory card 
  * Formatting memory card 

The application will show you the location where it is making a copy, the speed at which it is copying and remaining time and bytes. You will also get partition table information and generic information telling you things like memory size and available free space.
