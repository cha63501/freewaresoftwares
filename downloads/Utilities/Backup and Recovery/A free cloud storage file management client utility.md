**Publisher's Description**  
  


Cloud Filer is a cloud file management tool with a similar look and feel to an FTP client application. Cloud Filer allows you to upload and download files to cloud storage and can be used as part of your backup strategy. 

Cloud Filer can be used with any cloud storage provider which supports the Amazon S3 interface such as Amazon AWS, Google Storage or GreenQloud.

You can navigate your local machine by double-clicking on folders or by typing directory names in the input field above the local file list. If you click on the down arrow at the right-hand end of the input field you can select from the history of visited directories.

Creating a new remote folder is also a right-click action on the remote file list. You can also delete files, folders or buckets using the Delete right-click action.

Just like the local directory input field above the local file list the remote folder input field shows the current remote path and provides a history of visited remote folder locations. You can use the remote folder input field to navigate the remote buckets and folders or double-click on bucket or folder names.

Once you have navigated to a bucket or a folder within a bucket you can upload files or directories from your local machine to the currently shown remote location. You can cancel a file transfer while it is progress by clicking on the Cancel button on the progress dialog box. You can download files to the local directory by selecting items in the remote cloud storage view and using the download action.
