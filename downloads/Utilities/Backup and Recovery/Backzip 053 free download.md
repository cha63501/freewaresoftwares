**Publisher's Description**  
  

BackZip is a file backup application that stores backup sets in standard ZIP
format. The backup sets can be stored locally or on a mapped network drive.
Selectable options allow you to specify a single ZIP for all files, a separate
ZIP for each file, or a simple file copy (uncompressed) to the destination
directory.

Backup sets can be tagged with a timestamp and masks allow you to exclude
files with specific extensions from the backup archive. Backup sets can be
specified using command line options allowing you to schedule automated
backups using any task scheduling application, or to create easy backup
shortcuts.
