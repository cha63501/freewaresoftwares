**Publisher's Description**  
  


Reuse Bin is a Recycle Bin substitute for removable media. The Recycle Bin of Windows does not reserve the files on removable media. Reuse Bin does it instead. The program stores to-delete files in a directory structure that reflects the original locations. 

For example, a file "C:\Documents\Example.txt" would be stored as "\\\C\Documents\Example.txt". The user can manage (move, copy, delete, etc.) the bin contents freely at oneA's own risk.
