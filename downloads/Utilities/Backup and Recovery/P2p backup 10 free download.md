**Publisher's Description**  
  

When was the last time you made a backup of your personal photos, movies or
documents? Do you keep all valuable data on CDA's stored next to your
computer?  
  
P2P Backup is an attempt to solve these problems. When more and more people
have access to broadband connections it is now a realistic option to store
large amounts of data online. However, most online backup services are
expensive to use and limit the storage to a few hundred megabytes.  
  
When registering with P2P Backup you allow another P2P Backup user to store
his backup on your computer while you are allowed to store your files on his.
All files are encrypted so no one but you can read the content. To add
additional safety it is possible to distribute backup data to several other
users. In that way, if something happens with the data stored on one of the
computers, the backup is still available on one of the others.
