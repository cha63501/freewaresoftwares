**Publisher's Description**  
  

DBackup is a program to backup your data easier and faster. The files included
in the backup are selected by their type, not by their name. Therefore all the
unnecessary files are skipped and, furthermore, the backup automatically
supports new files addition.

The main features of DBackup are as follows:

  * It allows you to filter only the important files using appropriate filters. 
  * It supports subfolders recursion. 
  * An easy user interface shows all your backup as icons and lets you start them simply by a double click. You may also create shortcuts on the Windows Desktop to start your backups faster. 
  * The new tooltip-based help system will guide you step by step through the definition of your backups. 
  * It is always possible to check the list of files which will be included in the next backup operation. 
  * The destination file is a ZIP-compatible file and can be placed on any support (floppy disk, hard drive, CD-ROM or even a network drive). 
  * You can choose some predefined file type groups from a library, to automatically select all the files supported by specific applications. The program comes with a default library, but you can customize it. 
  * DBackup supports English and Italian, and is able to automatically find which language is configured in your system.
