**Publisher's Description**  
  

DirDup is a free software that can monitor, copy, and manage your files.

Why did I write it? Because XCOPY was too slow for my needs and was lacking a
compare/verify feature, so I decided to write my own utility. Besides being a
good JAVA exercise, I knew I would use it every day, and I do use it everyday:
I use it to backup my development computer to a memory stick.

Here is a short summary of what dirdup does:

  * Copies directories 
  * Exclude list allows you to exclude specified files from copying 
  * Quick Copy Mode: checks the filesA' dates/size before making the decision to copy -- this can save a lot of time when backing up to a slow-write device, such as flash memory sticks 
  * Full Copy Mode: compares all of the files in the destination and source directories - even if the size and dates match, DirDup does a byte-by-byte comparison to detect data deterioration 
  * Validates source files before they are copied - ensures that a good backup file isnA't overwritten by an incomplete or damaged source file 
  * Displays copied files, file statistics, and (most importantly) any errors in the log window 
  * You can run any task automatically, just pass it as the argument to dirdup. You can easily create a shortcut for your backup task.
