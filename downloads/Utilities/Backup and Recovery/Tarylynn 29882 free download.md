**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tarylynn - taking your work home with you? Then Tarylynn is what you need to
synchronize your files quickly and painlessly.

Tarylynn synchronizes two folders and all subfolders within. Good for a quick
backup to a network drive, or copying files to a laptop. No need to spend time
trying to setup a windows briefcase. Because Tarylynn does not depend on a
database like briefcase does, backups are more portable, and there is no
single point of failure. If files exist on both sides, the file modified dates
are compared and the newer one is copied across. When deleting, files existing
on both sides are ignored regardless of modified dates.

Tarylynn is very easy to use, just select the two folders to compare and
choose to copy folder from the left to the right or vice versa. Tarylynn can
even be scripted for automatic running. Useful for periodic backups, or for
copying default user settings for software installation.

Tarylynn also comes with a simple FTP mode. Great for updating webpages or
accessing work servers when at home.

**Features:**

  * Tarylynn is easy to use. There is no need to setup complex rules before you work. Just point to the folders you want and go! This make is extremely convenient in syncing multiple machines. 
  * Peace of mind. Two different preview modes show the user exactly what will happen before performing the sync operation. From the details window, you can choose to sync individual files any way you wish. 
  * If you cannot remember which files you updated last, check using the Tools->Get latest timestamps feature. 
  * Simple FTP mode. FTP mode can be used for the preview function. From the details window, you can choose which files to sync. 
  * Tarylynn can be scripted for automatic running. Simply create a command file, and call Tarylynn with itA's path as the argument. System admins will find this useful for backing up user files, or to setup default user environments. Set Tarylynn to ignore errors and add a quit command at the end of the script to have complete user-interaction free operation. 
  * Multiple actions can be scripted into one command file, but the free version will only run 2 actions. The registered version of Tarylynn does not have any restrictions. Note that the quit command counts as one action. 
**Note:** Free for personal use only. 

**What's New in version 2.9.882:**

  * Changed: in copy mode, when the target file has the same file date but is zero size, it will be overwritten
