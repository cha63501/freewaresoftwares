**Publisher's Description**  
  

ODIN is a utility for easy backup of hard drive volumes or complete hard
drives under Windows.

A disk image can be created or restored. Only used clusters can be backed up,
compression on the fly is possible. It runs under 32-Bit Windows Operating
Systems.

How many hours did you spend in setting up your Windows system? Setting up the
operating system, installing programs, customizing to your personal needs.

Do you want to be protected against hard disk failures, viruses or other
malware? Just restore your system within minutes. Why spend money for a
commercial solution? Now with snapshot support (using the Microsoft Volume
Shadow Copy Service).
