This is simple but very useful synchronization utility. 

This program can synchronize only files which were modified in the past few days. So, you can have two large folders on two computers, and you are using Flash Drive for copying files, for example. When you make some change in one of these folders, you can call Sync Last Files for synchronization. It will copy only modified files to the Flash Drive. This greatly helps to synchronize big folders, which are normally canA't be placed on the Flash Drive entirely.

Another great feature of this utility is capability of making incremental backups of files which are will be replaced. So you can return to any version of a file, if you incendentialy damaged last version of that file.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
