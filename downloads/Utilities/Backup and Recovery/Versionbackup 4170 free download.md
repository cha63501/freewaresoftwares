**Publisher's Description**  
  

Backup files, which are still present when you need them.

Other backup systems confine themselves to the mere creation of the backup
copies. Doing this, they overwrite the formerly created backups whenever they
copy a later version of the same file. Real data security will be obtained
only if the older versions will continue existing. The different versions must
be managed in a structured backup archive. VersionBackup provides these
features.

  * Existing backups will not be overwritten. 
  * The version management makes it possible to find any stored backup version within seconds. 
  * Backups no longer will be a matter of chance. Instead of this, you will follow a systematical backup strategy. 
  * You can recover from Incremental Backups with the same safety and comfort, as otherwise it is only possible with Full Backups. 
The free standard edition of VersionBackup has been designed for private users
only.
