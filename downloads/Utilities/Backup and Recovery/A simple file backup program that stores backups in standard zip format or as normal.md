**Publisher's Description**  
  


BackZip is a file backup application that stores backup sets in standard ZIP format. The backup sets can be stored locally or on a mapped network drive. Selectable options allow you to specify a single ZIP for all files, a separate ZIP for each file, or a simple file copy (uncompressed) to the destination directory. 

Backup sets can be tagged with a timestamp and masks allow you to exclude files with specific extensions from the backup archive. Backup sets can be specified using command line options allowing you to schedule automated backups using any task scheduling application, or to create easy backup shortcuts.
