**You need the Ultimate Boot CD if you want to:**

  * **Run floppy-based diagnostic tools from CDROM drives**. More and more PCs are shipped without floppy drives these days, and it is such a royal pain when you need to run diagnostic tools on them. 
  * **Free yourself from the slow loading speed of the floppy drive**. Even if you do have a floppy drive, it is still much much faster to run your diagnostic tools from the CDROM drive, rather than wait for the tool to load from the floppy drive. 
  * **Consolidate as many diagnostic tools as possible into one bootable CD**. WouldnA't you like to avoid digging into the dusty box to look for the right floppy disk, but simply run them all from a single CD? Then the Ultimate Boot CD is for you! 
When you boot up from the CD, a text-based menu will be displayed, and you will be able to select the tool you want to run. The selected tool actually boots off a virtual floppy disk created in memory.
