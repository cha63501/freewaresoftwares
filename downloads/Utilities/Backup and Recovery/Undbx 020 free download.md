**Publisher's Description**  
  

UnDBX is a tool to extrect email messages from Outlook Express .DBX files.

On first invocation all messages will be extracted as individual .eml files.
Subsequent invocations will only update the output directory. Any .eml files
that do not correspond to messages in the .dbx file will be treated as deleted
messages and will be deleted from the disk.

Furthermore, only new messages, that do not correspond to files on disk, will
be extracted from the .dbx file. UnDBX was written to facilitate fast
incremental backup of .dbx files.
