**Publisher's Description**  
  

Automatic Backup is an application that allows you backup your files and
schedule backups for later save.

If you ever lost your data, there is no need to persuade you that having
reliable backup software is an absolute necessity. Backup software not only
protects your data, but also keeps old versions of your files and makes
finding documents easy.

The program can function completely autonomously and automatically. This is
critical, since many users forget to back up their data regularly and only
software that has scheduling options ensures that your data is getting backed
up often. Also, Automatic Backup allows you to back up your data to a variety
of storage media- local drive, network drive, external drive, floppy, ftp -
server. It can also compress backed up data to .zip files in order to save
space.
