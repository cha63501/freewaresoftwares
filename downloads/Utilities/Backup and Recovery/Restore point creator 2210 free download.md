**WhatA's New in version 2.2.10:**

  * This is a minor update. Fixed an annoying cosmetic issue on the main window in which the Restore Point Name textbox didnAt go back to grayed-out box with the text AType in a name for your custom-named System Restore PointAA in it in all situations when it lost focus. This should have been the case but for whatever reason it didnAt always do it in rare occasions.
