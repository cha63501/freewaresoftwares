Software Settings Backup Tool will save and restore the settings of your
programs in a folder. If you reinstall Windows, you donA't need to reconfigure
manually your programs. You can also export the settings from an old computer
and import them to a new computer.

The program works also if you restore the settings in a computer with
different language, user name or system folders (eg: "C:Documents and
SettingsUserApplication Data" and "V:UsersGeorgeApplication Data" are the some
thing for the program). You can choose the program settings you want to back
up and add other programs.
