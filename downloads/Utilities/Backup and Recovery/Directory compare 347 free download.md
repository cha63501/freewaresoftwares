Directory Compare is a utility to help you keep copies of your important
directories (documents, programs under development, etc.) in a backup hard
disk or any other storage system (like 100Mb diskettes), as well as in a
compressed .zip file.

Directory Compare is a kind or GUI version of cpy: it has far less options but
its visual interface makes easier selective copies.

Directory Compare will show you side by side the source and backup directories
so that you can easily select the files to by copied (from the source to the
target or in both directories) and even delete from both directories auxiliary
files.

**WhatA's New in version 3.47:**

  * New File/Create shortcut menu to create shortcuts (for automatic backups, ...) and to prepare arguments for Directory Compare, batch files, etc..
