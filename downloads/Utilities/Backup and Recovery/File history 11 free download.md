**Publisher's Description**  
  

File History is a small and simple tool for versioned backup. You select a set
of files and can then save a snapshot of these files whenever you want.

A complete file history consists of only two files. One contains a link to the
selected files and one contains the snapshots. A specially designed
compression and binary compare algorithm are used to save the snapshots as
efficient as possible.
