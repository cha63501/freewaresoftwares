**Publisher's Description**  
  

UBT stands for Universal Backup Tool. It uses leading-edge technology (parts
of UBT are used by NASA) to make backups of your HD while minimizing the
storage space required. Backups can be restored very quick. It is a simple-to-
use yet powerful application that is cross-compatible with all modern versions
of Windows (hence the word Universal).

Have you ever tried to restore a backup performed with MSBACKUP under Windows
98 on a Windows 2000 machine? If so, you will know that although MSBACKUP
looks exactly the same in both cases, the versions are not compatible and the
restore process is next to impossible.

UBT provides the missing compatibility without sacrificing speed and
reliability. It even runs under Linux using A'WineA' - a Windows environment
for Linux/Unix.

**Features:**

  * Speed, safety and simplicity are the essence of UBT. 
  * UBT is optimized for backup to external drives via USB2 or to alternate HD drives but it works with other configurations. 
  * A new and highly efficient backup solution based on file signatures: it uses an optimized version of the MD5 algorithm to calculate a unique signature for each file. 
  * Completely reliable. Recovers perfectly from outages during operation. Copying of files and data is managed by an advanced database engine with transaction commitment and roll-back, preventing data corruption due to power outages, system crashes, etc. 
  * UBT is based on industry standards to ensure compatibility with future versions of operating systems and hardware. 
  * Full backups every time A does away with incremental backups and the associated hassle during restore. 
  * Easy and intuitive to use. One simple intuitive interface provides all the power. 
  * Complete control over the backup process and management of past backups via the same interface. 
  * Fast A full backups in minutes and it gets faster. 
  * Less space A the space required is dramatically reduced by UBTAs approach. Entire folders are backed up in minimum space. 
  * Completely compatible with other backup tools (does not use or change the archive bit). 
  * Very effective in mission critical environments, where downtime must be minimized. 
  * No problem backing up multiple machines to the same external drive via a USB2 port (simply install UBT on each machine and create a separate backup path).
