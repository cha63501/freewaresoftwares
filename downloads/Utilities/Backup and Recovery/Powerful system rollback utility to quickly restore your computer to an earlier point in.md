**Publisher's Description**  
  


Comodo Time Machine (CTM) is a powerful system rollback utility that allows users to quickly restore their computers to an earlier point in time. CTM A'snapshotsA' are a complete record of your entire system (including the registry, critical operating system files and user created documents). 

**Layered Security:**

  * Schedule automatic snapshots to be taken at regular intervals 
  * Roll back to the last known working state in the event of virus attacks or crashes 
  * Take snapshots of your computer before large installations or system maintenance 

Software Developers and testers can easily restore test systems to the default configuration after each deployment without the need to manually uninstall each application. Home users can even let the kids run amok on the family PC for an afternoon and be safe in the knowledge that any damage can be instantly undone and all files recovered.

Comodo Time Machine features an intuitive, friendly interface which offers quick and easy access to all functionality in the application. Additionally, it also features a sub-console that can be accessed before Windows starts and a Quick Operation console containing shortcuts to important and commonly executed tasks.
