**Publisher's Description**  
  

Cloud Filer is a cloud file management tool with a similar look and feel to an
FTP client application. Cloud Filer allows you to upload and download files to
cloud storage and can be used as part of your backup strategy.

Cloud Filer can be used with any cloud storage provider which supports the
Amazon S3 interface such as Amazon AWS, Google Storage or GreenQloud.

You can navigate your local machine by double-clicking on folders or by typing
directory names in the input field above the local file list. If you click on
the down arrow at the right-hand end of the input field you can select from
the history of visited directories.

Creating a new remote folder is also a right-click action on the remote file
list. You can also delete files, folders or buckets using the Delete right-
click action.

Just like the local directory input field above the local file list the remote
folder input field shows the current remote path and provides a history of
visited remote folder locations. You can use the remote folder input field to
navigate the remote buckets and folders or double-click on bucket or folder
names.

Once you have navigated to a bucket or a folder within a bucket you can upload
files or directories from your local machine to the currently shown remote
location. You can cancel a file transfer while it is progress by clicking on
the Cancel button on the progress dialog box. You can download files to the
local directory by selecting items in the remote cloud storage view and using
the download action.
