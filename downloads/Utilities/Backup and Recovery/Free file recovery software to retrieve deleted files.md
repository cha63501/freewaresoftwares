You may want to recover deleted files for various reasons, which is where Wise Data Recovery program comes in handy. The free file recovery software can help you retrieve files you have accidentally deleted, those lost following a system crash or even the "unnecessary" ones that were deleted "permanently" to get more space. You can also use it to recover files from external storage devices like memory cards, USB flash drives and MP3 players. 

Besides being compatible with multiple devices, Wise Data Recovery can recover several file formats, including:

  * Documents 
  * Images 
  * Compressed files 
  * Audio 
  * Video 
  * E-mail files 

**Using Wise Data Recovery**

This is a lightweight program that installs and launches fast. On the upper left side are the places for selecting drives to recover deleted files from and a "Scan" button to find the files. Just below them is where file directories are listed after scanning, and on the right is the window where you see the files found. The program provides some details about the files, including their names, sizes, dates when they were last modified, paths and recoverability status. 

You will know the files you can recover and those with poor recoverability. On the left side of the file names are colored circles depicting recoverability status in the following manner:

  * Green: good 
  * Light Orange: poor 
  * Dark Orange: very poor 
  * Red: lost 

The file recovery software displays the number of files found on the lower left part of the list while the "Recover" button is on the right side. On the right upper part of the list is a search bar where you can input keywords to access the files you are interested in faster. You can also choose to narrow down the list by selecting a relevant file type.

We first selected our drive C for scanning and were impressed with the speed. We then scanned a different partition on our hard drive, and the scanning process took relatively longer although the space was smaller than drive C. We were not sure whether it was due to the fact that most of the space was used or because it had a different file system. However, we discovered it contained more than 18 times the number of deleted files.

Once we had selected the files to recover and clicked the "Recover" button, the program required us to choose the drive and directory to save the files to. The recovery process was a snap, and the program opened the directory as soon as we clicked "OK" on the pop-up window alerting us about completion of the process.

We wanted to see what would happen when we tried to recover files with different recoverability statuses. Although Wise Data Recovery retrieved the files marked as lost, they were so corrupted we could not use them. We managed to recover and use files marked as either poor or very poor, albeit with initial error messages. The ones marked as good opened without a hitch.

If you want to recover deleted files on your computer or external storage media, Wise Data Recovery is an acceptable choice.
