**Publisher's Description**  
  

Raw Copy copies a disk as a raw image from one drive directly to another. Raw
Copy was designed for users who have faulty drive and would like to transfer
the data directly to another drive without doing a file by file copy. This
saves the need for operating system re-installs and allows drives with an
unknown file system to be copied (including from console game machines, data
recorders, mac etc).

The program has a built in data recovery function which will attempt to
recover data from bad sectors to ensure all the available data is restored
from the drive. This program is designed to run under NT/XP/2000 or later
operating systems. It will run under windows 95/98/Me operating systems but
only windows logical drives can be copied.
