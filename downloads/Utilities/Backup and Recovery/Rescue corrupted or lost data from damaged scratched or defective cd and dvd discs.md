Abyssal Recovery can rescue corrupted or lost data from damaged, scratched, or defective CD and DVD discs. 

Abyssal Recovery can copy the files to another destination on your hard drive.

Abyssal Recovery will skip the bytes which are not readable from file and copy all other bytes to extract maximum data. You can set the program to copy byte with byte to minimize the losses, or you can set a higher number of bytes to be copied once for a faster recovery.

Please note that badly corrupted files recovery is not always possible. Abyssal Recovery will skip any read error encountered.

Abyssal Recovery is free for non-commercial purpose.
