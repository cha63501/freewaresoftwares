**Publisher's Description**  
  

Jackup is a simple and easy to use backup tool made in Java. Choose two
folders, source and destination. Jackup scans all the files and subfolders,
and tells you what files have been changed and which files donA't exist in the
source anymore.

There are three ways to compare files: date/time, date/time/size or
date/time/contents. If you want to be absolutely sure that files are identical
both in the source and destination, choose the last option.

Feedback about the program is very important! Send me some email and tell what
you like about Jackup and what could be done better.

**Jackup needs [Java JRE release 5.0](http://www.java.com) to run.**
