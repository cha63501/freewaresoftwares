**Publisher's Description**  
  

RestoreBack is a disk backup utility written in Java (Java is a trademark of
Sun Microsystems) programming language. This program lets you create backup of
the files and folders on your disk painlessly.

RestoreBack lets you archive all your selected files and folders to a single
.zip archive. The program also allows you to update your archive when the
files or folders that you backed up previously (using this program) undergo
any change on your disk. Armed with GUI as impressive as I could create, I
think youA'd find this feature-rich program quite useful.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
