**Publisher's Description**  
  


Free, easy, and efficient backup software! It can back up folders/files from one drive to another anytime you want on-demand (including with an optional direct shortcut on your desktop to run the backup), on a timed schedule, or at logon. 

Back up to another hard drive, flash drive, network drive, CD/DVD (if packet-writing software is installed) and more. It can create identical folder/file structures on the backup drive, or can compress the data as .ZIP or LZMA-compressed .7z files. 

It can back up "in use" files, monitor and alert you to any errors, and it automatically handles the whole full/incremental backup thing that other programs make you deal with. Simple Data Backup is indeed simple - just pick the folders you want to be backed up and a few settings and youA're done!
