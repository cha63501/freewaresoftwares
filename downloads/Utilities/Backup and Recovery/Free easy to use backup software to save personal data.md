Would you like to control the way your backup program performs its tasks? Would you like to back up your files onto local drives, removable drives or servers? Would you like to achieve these free of charge? Then Personal Backup is your ideal choice. The free backup software will help you save your files to any destination folder you like. The program will also help you make multiple backups without unnecessarily storing duplicate files, as it only saves new files and newer versions of files already backed up. 

**Personal Backup Features:**

  * Wizard for creating new backup tasks 
  * Backs up complete directory structures 
  * Accommodates as many configurable backup tasks as the user wants 
  * Ability to set automatic backups or start backups on demand 
  * Many backup options 
  * Backing up via FTP 

**Using Personal Backup**

When we first launched the software, the wizard displayed a screen that allowed beginners to start the wizard while experienced users could start configuring their tasks as they wanted. The display also showed the three things to be specified for backups:

  * Destination where files will be backed up 
  * The directories to be backed up 
  * How the backup process is to be performed. You can choose to make direct copies of files, create a compressed archive to save space or encrypt data to enhance security. 

You can use different destinations to store your backups. However, it is not advisable to select the drive containing the system files.

There are three options when selecting the directories to be backed up: My documents, Application Data and Other Directory, which allows you to select the directories you want to back up. The program then took us to a window for selecting how we wanted to back up our data. The recommended options are selected by default.

We then entered the window where we were to choose whether we wanted backups to take place automatically after specified conditions. We could choose backups to occur daily or on a specific day on logon or logoff. The wizard recommended performing backups on logoff to save recently-changed data. We then had to choose a name for our backup task. It is a good idea to choose a name that will help you know what you have backed up.

The next window displayed the number of files and space required for backup. The window provides many options, but you donAt have to worry about them. You just need to click the "Start backup" button. You will then see a window showing you progress of the backup, and you can choose what should happen when the task is completed.

**Conclusion**

Personal Backup is an effective tool that suits both beginners and advanced users. However, you cannot use the free backup software to save or restore system files.
