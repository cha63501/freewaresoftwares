**Publisher's Description**  
  

SelfImage is the little hard drive utility with big aspirations. In its
current incarnation, SelfImage is capable of making an image of a hard disk
partition and writing it to another - useful for making backups.

Use SelfImage to create a disk image of any partition and even partitions that
Windows does not recognize (Linux partitions, etc).

Additionally, when run on Windows 2000 or XP, SelfImage can create images of
partitions that Windows doesnA't have mounted on a drive letter. Perfect for
the dual-boot system, you can create an image backup of a Linux partition
directly from Windows.

**Features:**

  * Create 1:1 image files of any mounted (or unmounted on Windows 2000/XP) hard disk partition. 
  * Can create an image of an entire hard disk, including the master boot record, partition table, and all partitions (Windows 2000/XP) 
  * Restore previously created images to any partition, even mounted ones, as long as it doesnA't have open files. 
  * On-the-fly compression accelerated with parallel CPU support to take advantage of todayA's hyperthreaded, multi-core and SMP systems. 
  * Skip reading a diskA's "free space", treating it as if it were zero. This decreases the size of a compressed image and makes it process MUCH faster. NEW Version 1.2.0 can now do this for Linux ext2/ext3 partitions as well. 
  * NEW Available as an experimental BartPE plugin for use in boot/rescue CDs. 
  * Network Block Device support to make images of disks on remote machines, and restore back to them. 
  * Multi-threaded design for maximum throughput and low CPU overhead. 
  * ItA's free software - free as in cost, and free as in open source - released under the GNU General Public License.
