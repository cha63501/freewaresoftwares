**Publisher's Description**  
  


DonA't have the Windows Operating System CD? Need it to reinstall or completely recover your Windows Operating System? Many manufacturers do not include the CD with your computer, and therefore usually copy an exactly duplicate of the CD in your hardrive. Use WinACCESS to scan your computer and execute the CD directly from your hardrive to install, recover or reinstall Windows, without the need of the CD! 

Sometimes manufacturers do not include the Windows CD with your purchase OR in your hardrive in a copied form, so if WinACCESS scans your computer and fails to find the copied version of the CD, it will notify you. If it is present, it will allow you to access it and restore your computer or perform any other desired task that the application on the copied CD allows you to do.
