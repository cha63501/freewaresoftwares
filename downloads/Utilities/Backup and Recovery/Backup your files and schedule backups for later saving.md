Automatic Backup is an application that allows you backup your files and schedule backups for later save.

Also, Automatic Backup allows you to back up your data to a variety of storage media- local drive, network drive, external drive, floppy, ftp - server. It can also compress backed up data to .zip files in order to save space.
