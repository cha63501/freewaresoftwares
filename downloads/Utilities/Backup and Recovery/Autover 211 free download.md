**Publisher's Description**  
  

AutoVer is a configurable automatic or real time backup and personal
versioning system. It can be used as a simple real time backup or as a more
complex version control system. The beauty of this system is that once you set
it up (which is extremely simple) it does everything. No remembering to backup
or to check in or check out files. Every time you save a file it is copied to
your backup folder or drive. You can include and exclude certain files and
browse the backups with the Backup Explorer.

Great for backing up (or one way synchronizing) your work or home documents to
flash memory or saving every change you make to your source code or image
files.

**Features:**

  * Select any number of separate folders or folder trees (including sub folders) to watch for changes - each folder tree has its own independent settings 
  * Select straight backup or versioning mode 
  * Select any folder or drive to backup to (including memory sticks) 
  * Optionally create an initial backup before the automatic backup starts and ensure it is current on every startup 
  * Restrict which files and folders to include and exclude (by file mask) & maximum size 
  * Optionally zip or delete old versions after a specified time 
  * Optionally delete backup files on original file deletion 
  * Fault tolerance in case your backup folder/drive goes off line or source files are locked 
  * MS Office and Visual Studio compatible (temp file creation, delete then rename is treated as original file change) 
  * Backup file & version explorer included 
  * Open backups or file versions directly (file extensions are preserved) or via inbuilt explorer 
  * Compare file versions (using customizable external application) 
  * Restore file versions via inbuilt explorer or manually 
  * Runs discretely in the Windows System Tray 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
