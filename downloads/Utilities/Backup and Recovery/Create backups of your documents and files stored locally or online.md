**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ocster Backup Free is a great backup software that was designed from the start to work fully automatic. You simply specify what you want backed up and when and then the software takes care of the rest. 

The backups can be stored either on an external local hard disk (FREE) or (for a small fee) via the internet on the specially secured and highly reliable Ocster Secure Storage. With Ocster Secure Storage multiple highly encrypted copies of the data are stored in professional data centers. This protects the data from the dangers that can render locally stored backups unusable at any time (hard disk crashes, fire, theft, water damage, ...).

Ocster Backup Free is really easy to use and requires no technical knowledge at all. But it still supports all the advanced features one expects from a modern backup software like incremental backups, encryption, compression and backing up open files. Backups can also be interrupted at any time and later resumed at the same point, even after restarting the computer.

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows XP/Vista/7 
  * 512 MB RAM 
  * Free space on hard disk: ca. 100 MB
