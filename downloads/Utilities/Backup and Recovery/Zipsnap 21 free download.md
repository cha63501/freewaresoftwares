**Publisher's Description**  
  

ZipSnap is a simple command-line directory backup tool. It creates compressed
(Zip) point-in-time snapshots, adding only new or modified files at each time.
Runs on any OS with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE 5.0+). ZipSnap is free
software written in Java and released under the GNU GPL license (version 2).

**Main Features**

  * ZipSnap creates archives comprising a _catalog_ (a text file) and a set of compressed _volumes_ (regular Zip files). The compressed volumes are automatically named `catalog_name.yyyyMMdd-HHmmss.n.zip`, where `yyyyMMdd-HHmmss` is the time of the snapshot, and `n` is the volume number.
  * For each snapshot, only new or modified files are added to the ZipSnap archive; the catalog is updated and an additional Zip file is created if necessary.
  * ZipSnap requires only the catalog for identifying new or modified files when adding snapshots, i.e. the previous compressed volumes (Zip files) are not needed.
  * By default, files are identified by their relative path name, size, and last-modified time (with an allowance of A+- 1 second for matching). Additionally, the CRC-32 checksum can be used. The allowance (if any) for the last-modified time can also be specified.
  * Files in the archive may be extracted by snapshot number or by volume number. Also, snapshots can be restored so that only non-existing files are extracted; files that exist but are not part of the snapshot can optionally be deleted.
