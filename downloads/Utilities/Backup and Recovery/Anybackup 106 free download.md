**Publisher's Description**  
  

AnyBackup is designed to fill the void of backing up one or more large volumes
to several smaller volumes. (Though in reality it can backup any number /
sized volumes to any number / sized volumes.)

These smaller volumes need not be persistent or always connected (that is,
AnyBackup will recognize the drives even if their drive letters change and
will prompt you to connect a drive if it is not available).
