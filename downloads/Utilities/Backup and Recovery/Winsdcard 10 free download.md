**Publisher's Description**  
  

Although you may copy files from your SD card to a computer without using any
third-party software, this does not give you an exact copy of your card. If
you would like to create an image of your SD card, then consider using
WinSDCard, which is meant for creating raw disk images.

This gives you a convenient way of backing up your SD card so that you can
later restore the content in the exact way. You will restore your card to its
original state without making any modifications. You can also use the small
application to write a bootable image that you can use to install a new
version of operating system on your mobile device.

**WinSDCard has three main functions:**

  * Creating image file of an SD card 
  * Copying image file to memory card 
  * Formatting memory card 

The application will show you the location where it is making a copy, the
speed at which it is copying and remaining time and bytes. You will also get
partition table information and generic information telling you things like
memory size and available free space.
