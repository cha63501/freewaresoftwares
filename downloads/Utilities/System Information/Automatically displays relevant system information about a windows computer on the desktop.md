**Publisher's Description**  
  


How many times have you walked up to a system in your office and needed to click through several diagnostic windows to remind yourself of important aspects of its configuration, such as its name, IP address, or operating system version. If you manage multiple computers you probably need BGInfo. It automatically displays relevant information about a Windows computer on the desktopA's background, such as the computer name, IP address, service pack version, and more. You can edit any field as well as the font and background colors, and can place it in your startup folder so that it runs every boot, or even configure it to display as the background for the logon screen. 

Because BGInfo simply writes a new desktop bitmap and exits you donA't have to worry about it consuming system resources or interfering with other applications.

BgInfo works on Windows 2000 SP4 Rollup 1 or above. 

**What's New in version 4.20:**

  * correctly reports version information for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.
