**Publisher's Description**  
  

Disc Space Reporter is a simple and effective program which gives you a clear
insight where you stuffed your hard drives with data you donA't even remember
anymore.

The most important feature is the drive usage report. After creating the
report your drives are shown in the typical tree structure. For each folder
the following information are displayed:

  * Space which the folder occupies including its sub folders. 
  * The percentage of space which it covers of its parent folder. 
  * The percentage of space which it reserves in terms of the entire drive. 
  * Space that the folder uses without taking its sub folders into account. 
The amount of used space does not consider clustering. Thus the real occupied
space size may vary.
