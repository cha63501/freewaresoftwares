**Publisher's Description**  
  

How many times have you walked up to a system in your office and needed to
click through several diagnostic windows to remind yourself of important
aspects of its configuration, such as its name, IP address, or operating
system version. If you manage multiple computers you probably need BGInfo. It
automatically displays relevant information about a Windows computer on the
desktopA's background, such as the computer name, IP address, service pack
version, and more. You can edit any field as well as the font and background
colors, and can place it in your startup folder so that it runs every boot, or
even configure it to display as the background for the logon screen.

Because BGInfo simply writes a new desktop bitmap and exits you donA't have to
worry about it consuming system resources or interfering with other
applications.

BgInfo works on Windows 2000 SP4 Rollup 1 or above.

**What's New in version 4.20:**

  * correctly reports version information for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.
