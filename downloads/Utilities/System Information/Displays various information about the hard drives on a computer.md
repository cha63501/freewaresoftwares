**Publisher's Description**  
  


DriveInfo, as its name clearly indicates, is a small application that helps users view details of the drives in their computers. It displays the used and free spaces on drives, and users may choose to display information about all drives or hide some. 

It detects removable drives attached to a computer and places an Eject button next to the drives.

DriveInfo performs other tasks like viewing system uptime, changing colors or themes of the interface and capturing desired parts of the screen. The included Zoom tool magnifies required parts to make them more visible. The application also provides shortcuts to Web pages, folders and applications. It can as well help in adjusting power options and viewing the internal IP address of a computer.

Users can drag and drop items to desired drives and customize theme. The application includes a button that can be configured to open a specific Web address, file or folder.
