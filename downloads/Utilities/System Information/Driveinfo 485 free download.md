**Publisher's Description**  
  

DriveInfo, as its name clearly indicates, is a small application that helps
users view details of the drives in their computers. It displays the used and
free spaces on drives, and users may choose to display information about all
drives or hide some.

It detects removable drives attached to a computer and places an Eject button
next to the drives.

DriveInfo performs other tasks like viewing system uptime, changing colors or
themes of the interface and capturing desired parts of the screen. The
included Zoom tool magnifies required parts to make them more visible. The
application also provides shortcuts to Web pages, folders and applications. It
can as well help in adjusting power options and viewing the internal IP
address of a computer.

Users can drag and drop items to desired drives and customize theme. The
application includes a button that can be configured to open a specific Web
address, file or folder.
