**Publisher's Description**  
  

PCI-Z is a freeware lightweight system utility designed to provide information
about (unknown) PCI (PCI-E, PCI-X...) devices.

PCI-Z is designed for detecting unknown hardware on your Windows based PC. It
will help you determine vendor, device and certain details about device even
if you donA't have drivers installed. Software uses The PCI ID Repository, a
public repository of all known IDA's used in PCI devices: IDA's of vendors,
devices, subsystems and device classes. It is used in various programs (e.g.
The PCI Utilities) to display full human-readable names instead of cryptic
numeric codes.

Both 32 bit (x86) and 64 bit (x64) Windows versions are fully supported, where
applicable. In addition, you can run PCI-Z on ReactOS in full functionality.
ReactOS is a free open source operating system based on the best design
principles found in the Windows NTA(r) architecture - providing completely and
in all ways legal and free platform for running PCI-Z without any Windows
licenses necessary. Software will NOT run on Windows 95, 98 or ME.

It does not require any library but default Windows ones. No Visual Studio C++
redistributed, no .NET platform, no Java. It doesnA't even require WMI, so you
can use it on Windows editions such as Bart PE and similar.

There is no installation or configuration! Simply run the file and wait until
you get the report. Afterwards, right click on the line to get options (copy
all data or just a segment) or export the whole list.

No configuration of whatsoever is needed.
