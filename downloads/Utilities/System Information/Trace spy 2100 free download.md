**Publisher's Description**  
  

TraceSpy is a pure .NET alternative to the very popular SysInternals DebugView
tool.

**Features:**

  * ItA's 100% .NET 
  * It does not need UAC to be disabled nor special rights 
  * It can remove empty lines (which is very handy to get rid of these pesky trace lines sent by Visual Studio 2010 for example...) 
  * The traced application is less blocked by this tracing tool than DebugView 
  * The Copy (CTRL-C) operation just copies the traced text, and not the full line (a full line copy feature is there though) 
  * The process name of the traced application is optionally displayed instead of the process id (if available and not dead at that time) 
  * The find dialog has an autocomplete feature 
  * Lines that contain newline characters (\r, \n) are not displayed as normal lines (DbgView does this) but as one big line 
  * There is a colorizer feature that allows traces colorization using regular expressions. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
