**Publisher's Description**  
  

As its name suggests, USB Device Tree Viewer is a tiny application that
provides information about USB ports and hubs on a computer in a tree view
format. The application, which is also referred to as UsbTreeView, is based on
the UsbTreeView embedded in the Windows Driver Development Kit.

USB Device Tree Viewer provides detailed information about all the USB hubs
and ports, starting with the details of the computer itself, including its
name and version of operating system used.

When you click on a name on the left pane, relevant details about it will be
displayed on the left pane. It uses different symbols to distinguish connected
devices from those that are not connected. You will get detailed information,
which is listed into different categories, including device information,
descriptor, capabilities and statistics.

In addition, right clicking on any device name provides more options,
including the ability to restart device or port, perform safe removal and see
device properties. If a given device does not work properly, this is where you
will determine the cause of its malfunction.

The latest version refreshes information automatically without affecting the
selected item when device change is performed asynchronously.

**WhatA's new in version 2.3.5.0:**
