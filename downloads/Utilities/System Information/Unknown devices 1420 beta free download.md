to open your case or look up random numbers off of PCI cards to figure out
what they are.

attempts to support future OSes. It runs fine from a CD or floppy. ItA's free
for personal and (especially) business use. The program contains no adware,
spyware, malware, popups, or whatever is the latest name for junk software.
