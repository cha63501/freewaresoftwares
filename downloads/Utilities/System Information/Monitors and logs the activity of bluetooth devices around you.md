**Publisher's Description**  
  


BluetoothLogView is a small utility that monitors the activity of Bluetooth devices around you, and displays a log of Bluetooth devices on the main window. 

Every time that a new Bluetooth device arrives to your area and when the device leaves your area, a new log line is added with the following information: Device Name, Device Address, Event Time, Event Type (A'Device ArrivalA' or A'Device LeftA'), Device Type, and the company that created the device. 

BluetoothLogView also allows you to specify a description for every device (according to its MAC address) that will appear under the A'DescriptionA' column. 

**System Requirements:**

  * Bluetooth dongle that works with the standard Bluetooth module of Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7. Currently, 3-party Bluetooth stacks, like Broadcom and BlueSoleil are not supported. 
  * Windows XP/SP2, Windows Vista, or Windows 7. Other versions of Windows donA't provide a build-in support for Bluetooth, and thus BluetoothLogView cannot work with them. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.08:**

  * Updated the internal MAC addresses file, and reduced its size inside the .exe file.
