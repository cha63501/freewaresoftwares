**Publisher's Description**  
  


DevManView is an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer. In addition to displaying the devices of your local computer, DevManView also allows you view the devices list of another computer on your network, as long as you have administrator access rights to this computer. 

DevManView can also load the devices list from external instance of Windows and disable unwanted devices. This feature can be useful if you have Windows operating system with booting problems, and you want to disable the problematic device. 

**System Requirements:**  
DevManView works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. For x64 version of Windows, you should download the x64 version of DevManView, because the 32-bit version of DevManView cannot disable/enable devices on x64 operating system. 

Download the 64-bit version. [DevManView 64-bit](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/devmanview-x64.zip). 

**WhatA's New in version 1.41:**
