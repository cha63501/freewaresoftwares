**Publisher's Description**  
  


WMI Asset Logger is a multifaceted utility that has the ability to return a great deal of information about windows based computer systems on your network, all from the convenience of your Windows XP workstation. WMI Asset Logger is also much more than that too, it is an administratorAs friend. Once you have scanned your network the true power of WMI Asset Logger comes out. Using the right-click speed menu enables you to quickly perform many tasks. Simply right-click on the desired host and choose Remote Control (initiate RDP Session), Remote Management Console, Install Software, View/Browse/Delete Shares, View/Start/Stop Processes on remote systems, and more. If you have administrative rights to a XP workstation, but the firewall is preventing you from getting results, simply right-click on the system and disable the XP firewall. Wait one minute, and rescan the system. (DonAt forget to re-enable that firewall!) 

Tired of having client/server based tools that blue-screen remote hosts? Or tired of dealing with messy Logon scripts to gather important information? WMI Asset Logger does not require any client-side installations and is a stand alone application. WMI Asset Logger uses all the tools that already exist on your XP Workstation to perform its duties. These utilities are native to windows and are much more stable than any add-on could hope to be. WMI Asset Logger also monitors its own progress too, if a client system hangs up WMI Asset Logger and you have to terminate it, it will automatically blacklist the computer system that was being scanning when it was terminated.

Just need a down dirty quick inventory of NetBIOS -> IP -> MAC -> FQDN relationships? Not a problem, simply perform an IP Inventory using WMI Asset Logger. WMI Asset logger will blaze through a list of 2000 computer with impressive speeds, and will even return the IP Address of systems that are currently off-line, allowing you to determine if a systemAs account may need to be deleted. (No IP information typically means the PC hasnAt been seen in the duration of a DHCP lease cycle).

You can enumerate a list of hosts to scan using the master browser list, or through the use of ADSI (Active Directory Server Interface). WMI Asset logger can also import text files as well as directly import DSQUERY COMPUTER text dumps too. And as a last resort an IP Ping Sweeper that will ping every IP Address that exists between any two addresses. WMI Asset Logger has the ability to save scans to Tab delimited text files, Straight to Microsoft Excel, or directly to your default printer. The TAB Delimited text files can be imported into almost any spreadsheet or database application like Microsoft Excel , Microsoft Access, or FoxPro Databases.
