**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Open Hardware Monitor is a free open source application that monitors
temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltages, load and clock speeds of a
computer. It supports most hardware monitoring chips found on todays
mainboards like the ITE, Winbond and Fintek families.

The CPU temperature can be monitored by reading the core temperature sensors
of Intel and AMD processors. The sensors of ATI and Nvidia video cards as well
as SMART hard drive temperature can be displayed.

The Open Hardware Monitor runs on 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows
operating systems without installation.

**Supported Hardware:**

  * CPU core sensors 
    * Intel Core 2, Core i3/i5/i7
    * AMD K8 (0Fh family), K10 (10h family)
  * Mainboard sensors 
    * ITE IT8712F, IT8716F, IT8718F, IT8720F, IT8726F
    * Fintek F71858, F71862, F71869, F71882, F71889ED, F71889F
    * Winbond W83627DHG, W83627DHG-P, W83627EHF, W83627HF, W83627THF, W83667HG, W83667HG-B, W83687THF
  * GPU sensors 
    * Nvidia
    * ATI
  * Hard disks 
    * S.M.A.R.T. sensors (optional)
  * Fan controllers 
    * T-Balancer bigNG

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).

**WhatA's New in version 0.6.0 Beta:**

  * Added a new plotting implementation using a .NET 2.0 backport of the OxyPlot library. All types of sensors can now be added to the plot. The plot can be configured to use stacked axes instead of subplots for each sensor type. The plot supports automatic or manual plot region selection. 
  * Added support for Intel Haswell CPUs. 
  * Added support for AMD family 15h model 1Xh and family 16h CPUs. 
  * Added support for the Fintek F71869A (F71868AD) super I/O chip. 
  * Added support for new Samsung SSDs (like Samsung SSD 840 PRO). 
  * Added support for fan control on ITE 87XX chips and a mainboard specific configuration for the Gigabyte GA 970A UD3 (both based on a patch from Eric Hokanson). 
  * Changed the HDD detection to list hard drives without SMART support as well. 
  * Enabled fan control on mainboards by default. 
  * Improved the kernel driver loading code. 
  * Added additional information from the SMBIOS to the report. 
  * Fixed some stability issues in the remote web server implementation. 
  * Fixed a stability issue in the WMI provider implementation. 
  * Extended the list of supported super I/O chips on Linux using the lm-sensors interface. 
  * Reduced the amount of dynamic memory allocation.
