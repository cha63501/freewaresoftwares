Program supports Win 95, 98, 98se, Me, 2k, XP and 2003 but not NT. It also attempts to support future OSes. It runs fine from a CD or floppy. ItA's free for personal and (especially) business use. The program contains no adware, spyware, malware, popups, or whatever is the latest name for junk software.
