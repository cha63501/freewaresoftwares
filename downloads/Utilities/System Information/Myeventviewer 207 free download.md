**Publisher's Description**  
  

MyEventViewer is a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.
As oppose to Windows event viewer, MyEventViewer allows you to watch multiple
event logs in one list, as well as the event description and data are
displayed in the main window, instead of opening a new one.

Also, with MyEventViewer you can easily select multiple event items and then
save them to HTML/Text/XML file, or copy them to the clipboard (Ctrl+C) and
then paste them into Excel.

**System Requirements:** This utility works on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003 Server, and Windows Vista. However, be aware that the event viewer of Windows Vista displays more event details than MyEventViewer.

**WhatA's New in version 2.07:**

  * Fixed to display date/time properly according to daylight saving time settings.
