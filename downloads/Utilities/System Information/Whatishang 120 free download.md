**Publisher's Description**  
  

Sometimes, a Windows software hangs, the user interface doesnA't respond
anymore, and you cannot find out what is cause of the problem. This utility
tries to detect the software that is currently hanging, and displays some
information that may allow you to understand what exactly cause the software
to hang.

Most of the information displayed in the report of WhatIsHang, like Call
Stack, Stack Data, Processor Registers, and Memory Data, is designed for users
with Windows programming knowledge. However, WhatIsHang also displays a list
of strings and dll files related to the hang problem, which can also help
users without programming knowledge to understand the cause of the problem.

**System Requirements And Limitations:**

  * This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 7/2008. 
  * For now, WhatIsHang can only detect hang problems of 32-bit applications. In future versions, support for x64 applications will be added too. Be aware that if you have the 64-bit version of Windows, you can still use WhatIsHang, as long as the hanging application is running under WOW64 (32-bit application). 
  * On Windows 7/2008/Vista with UAC turned on: WhatIsHang cannot detect hanging application if itA's running with SYSTEM or Administrator privilege. In order to solve this problem, you have to right-click on WhatIsHang.exe and choose A'Run As AdministratorA'. 
  * Some hang problems cannot be detected properly by WhatIsHang, for example: 
    * Programs without any user interface. 
    * When the program hangs because one thread waits for the other one. (In this case, WhatIsHang will show the details of the waiting thread, but the problem might be in the other thread) 
    * When the entire system hangs - In this case WhatIsHang wonA't be able to run... 

**WhatA's New in version 1.20:**

  * Added x64 build, for getting a report about freezing 64-bit applications. 
  * Added list of all loaded modules to the report. 
  * Fixed the flickering problem in the status bar. 
  * When WhatIsHang fails to extract information from the process, it now displays a message about that in the report, instead of showing report full of zero numbers...
