**Publisher's Description**  
  

Windows Product Key Viewer is a free utility that will display the installed
Windows Product Key (cd key) and other important Windows system information.
You can save this information to a text file, copy the key code or print the
Windows information for later use. Including the product key the program
displays the full Windows version (and service packs), product id,
installation date and time, registered user and organization and the Windows
uptime.

Windows Product Key Viewer is great if you ever need to find out your Windows
product (CD) key. Windows does not provide a way to view the installed product
key. If you have lost your key or the registration card that it is printed on,
you are out of luck. Re-installing Windows requires you to have the original
product key. Fortunately there is Windows Product Key Viewer.
