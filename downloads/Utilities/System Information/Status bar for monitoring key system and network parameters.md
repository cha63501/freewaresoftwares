**Publisher's Description**  
  


DerBar is a simple, slightly-configurable status bar for monitoring key system and network parameters. 

It is modeled on older status-monitoring programs, but without the configuration options of those other programs; it is designed for compactness and compatibility, not for turning parts on and off. The few configuration options that are present, are accessed via the icon in the system tray. 

You can move DerBar anywhere you want, by grabbing it and dragging it around, and it will remember where you leave it next time it runs. 

Win32 source code is available.
