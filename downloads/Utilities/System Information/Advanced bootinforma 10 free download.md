**Publisher's Description**  
  

This is a Windows Operating System tweak that turns on the logging information
when your machine is booting up, logging in and shutting down.

This program actually shows you is the processes that are being carried out by
your machine instead of the Windows timer cursor.

This program is also in an MSI format which allows you to distribute it to
multiple machines on a large scale using system tools such as Group Policy,
Configuration Manager or WDS during operating system deployment.
