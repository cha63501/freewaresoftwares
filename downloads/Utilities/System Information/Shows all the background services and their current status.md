**Publisher's Description**  
  


The QuickService application first shows all the background services and their current status. A filtered list of services may be setup so you only need to view those services you are interested in. The app can then be hidden in the System Tray for quick access to view the status of, start, pause, or stop the services in the list. The app does not refresh itself, so it takes up very little, if any, CPU or memory. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
