**Publisher's Description**  
  


DebugView is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your local system, or any computer on the network that you can reach via TCP/IP. It is capable of displaying both kernel-mode and Win32 debug output, so you donA't need a debugger to catch the debug output your applications or device drivers generate, nor do you need to modify your applications or drivers to use non-standard debug output APIs. 

**WhatA's New in version 4.81:**

  * Version 4.81 of DebugView, a utility that logs user and kernel-mode debug output messages, fixes a bug that could cause it on some executions to fail to capture debug output and enter a CPU-bound loop.
