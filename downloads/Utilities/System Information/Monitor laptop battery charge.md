**Publisher's Description**  
  


This application will assist in making the computer use the battery in the most efficient way, ie utilizing a complete charge or discharge cycle rather than just a partial one. It will prompt the user to continue with the same cycle on restart that was being used previously. 

In order to achieve this it is important that a battery goes from a fully charged state to a fully discharged one, rather than just being fractionally charged each time, although the battery will not suffer adversely if the main power is used on every occasion. However, should the user choose otherwise, the above prompts can easily be suppressed. 

Simpler Install procedure - v6002.Fix Service StartPending in XP (v6003). 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
