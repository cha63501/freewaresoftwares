**Publisher's Description**  
  

This compact utility displays the real-time CPU and RAM usage right on the
taskbarA's notification area (next to the system clock).

**Features:**

  * Real-time reporting of the CPU activity. 
  * Real-time reporting on the system RAM usage. 
  * This program does not require installation, or administrative privileges to operate and can be run from any location on your hard drive. 
  * This program also obtains the following information about the CPU(s) on your system (Central Processing Units): 
    * Brand name of the CPU. 
    * CPU architecture, i.e. 32-bit, 64-bit, etc. 
    * CPU clock reading. 
    * Number of physical and logical cores. 
    * Number of NUMA nodes. 
    * Information about L1/L2/L3 caches. 
    * Additional technical information about CPU, reported directly by the die. 
  * This program also obtains the following information about the RAM (or system memory): 
    * Total amount of memory available for the operating system. 
    * Total amount of memory physically installed in computer (youA'd be surprised to see this result on some systems!) 
    * The size of the page file. 
    * Detailed information about the memory banks physically installed in the system, such as: 
      * Capacity of each RAM module in bytes 
      * Form factor (DIMM, RIMM, etc) 
      * Memory type (SDRAM, DDR, DDR-2, etc) 
      * Type detail (synchronous, nonvolatile, etc) 
      * RAM speed (566 ns, 800 ns, etc) 
      * Data width (64 bits, etc) 
      * Interleave information 
      * Serial, manufactureA's, SKU and part numbers on RAM modules 
      * And more, where available. 
  * We attempted to write this program with as small of an imprint on the system resources as possible to improve the accuracy of its reporting.
