**Publisher's Description**  
  

GKrellM is a single process stack of system monitors which supports applying
themes to match its appearance to your window manager, Gtk, or any other
theme.

**Features & Differences:**

The most significant differences between the Windows version and the Unix
version of GKrellM are:

  * No local mail support (Windows has no concept of local mail) 
  * Hardware sensors are read using external tools. Supported tools are: 
    * SpeedFan (recommended) 
    * CoreTemp (since GKrellM 2.3.2) 
    * MBM (outdated and not recommended anymore) 
  * Windows has no concept of system load (i.e. "proc"), therefore the system load value is calculated by GKrellM itself. This calculation is rather inaccurate compared to the system load value determined by Unix systems. 
  * Swap activity cannot be determined in a reliable way on windows, therefore the swap activity graph is non-functional 

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows XP SP2 (32 bit) 
  * Windows Vista SP1 (32 bit, GKrellM needs at least SP1) 
  * Windows 7 (both 32 bit)
