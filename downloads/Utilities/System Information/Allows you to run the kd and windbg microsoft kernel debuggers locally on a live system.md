**Publisher's Description**  
  


LiveKD allows you to run the Kd and Windbg Microsoft kernel debuggers, which are part of the Debugging Tools for Windows package, locally on a live system. Execute all the debugger commands that work on crash dump files to look deep inside the system. See the Debugging Tools for Windows documentation and our book for information on how to explore a system with the kernel debuggers. 

While the latest versions of Windbg and Kd have a similar capability on Windows XP and Server 2003, LiveKD enables more functionality, such as viewing thread stacks with the !thread command, than Windbg and KdA's own live kernel debugging facility.

**Runs on:**  
Client: Windows XP and higher.  
Server: Windows Server 2003 and higher.

**WhatA's New in version 5.31:**

  * This release fixes a debugger help library search bug and fixes a bug in Windows 8/Windows Server 2012 mirror dump support.
