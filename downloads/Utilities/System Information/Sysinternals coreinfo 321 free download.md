**Publisher's Description**  
  

Coreinfo is a command-line utility that shows you the mapping between logical
processors and the physical processor, NUMA node, and socket on which they
reside, as well as the cacheAs assigned to each logical processor. It uses the
WindowsA GetLogicalProcessorInformation function to obtain this information
and prints it to the screen, representing a mapping to a logical processor
with an asterisk e.g. A*A.

Coreinfo is useful for gaining insight into the processor and cache topology
of your system.
