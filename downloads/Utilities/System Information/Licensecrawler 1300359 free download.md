**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you want to setup your computer system again you need to have the licenses
and serial numbers at hand for all the software programs that you have
purchased and registered. This does include the Windows product key but also
other serial numbers for applications like Nero, Office, VMWare and pretty
much every other application.

Instead of searching for the keys in your emails, manuals and recipes you
could use another approach. License Crawler is a sweet little application that
scans the Windows Registry for Windows product keys and other serial numbers
and licenses.

The License Crawler can discover application product keys and other serial
numbers or licenses very quickly and supports all versions of Windows
operating system from Windows 95 to Windows Server 2008 R2.

It is a portable application that can be run from any location and would be a
perfect fit for an USB stick. Asking clients to find serial and license keys
is often very frustrating. Instead, tech support can simply run License
Crawler without having to interact with the client at all.
