If you want to keep your computer working in top condition, then you must know
the processes and programs it runs. System Explorer is a powerful free system
information tool that provides in-depth analysis of a computer to help in
knowing what is going on behind the scenes. You can use it to know the drivers
installed in the system being analyzed, the number of active processes and
startup applications among others. You can then manage your system better for
optimum performance.

**Main Features of System Explorer:**

  * Provides comprehensive information about processes, tasks, modules, services, startups, connections, drivers, opened files, windows, uninstallers and IE Addons 
  * Monitoring system changes and process activities easily 
  * Checking suspicious files via VirusTotal service or File Database 
  * Displaying the usage of important system resources through graphs 
  * Providing detailed status of system and battery 
  * System Additional Info and WMI Browser 
  * Multilanguage support 

System Explorer has an intuitive interface with tabs located on top of the
main window. We found it relatively easy to use all features of this startup
manager. While its features will please seasoned users, this makes it equally
suitable for beginners.

We customized the tab bar to display the details we were interested in. In
addition to customizing the programAs appearance, we also adjusted how it
worked. We even set it as our default task manager. We used the startup
manager to delete unwanted items from the startup menu and deactivate
processes we were not using.

Besides System ExplorerAs ability to provide detailed information, we liked
its ability to scan running processes for any suspicious activity. Of course,
this feature requires an Internet connection to access the online security
database. Jotti and VirusTotal services scan all processes online, which is
good since the database is always updated to ensure you get the best security
possible.

This free system information tool provided more information than we expected.
If we needed more information than the program provided, it gave us the option
to get more details from Google. Each tab provides a lot of information,
complete with useful tips and graphs that not only provide details but also
make them easier to understand. The program kept us abreast of what was
happening on our system in real time.

While System Explorer provides lots of information, it uses low system
resources and runs pretty fast. You can download the program and use it for
either personal or commercial services free of charge. You may choose either
the installer or portable version. It supports 29 languages and is compatible
with Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8 operating systems.
