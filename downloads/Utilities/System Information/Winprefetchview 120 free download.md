**Publisher's Description**  
  

Each time that you run an application in your system, a Prefetch file which
contains information about the files loaded by the application is created by
Windows operating system. The information in the Prefetch file is used for
optimizing the loading time of the application in the next time that you run
it.

WinPrefetchView is a small utility that reads the Prefetch files stored in
your system and displays the information stored in them. By looking in these
files, you can learn which files every application is using, and which files
are loaded on Windows boot.

**System Requirements:**

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows XP, and up
to Windows 7. Earlier versions of Windows are irrelevant for this utility,
because the donA't use Prefetch files.

**What's New in version 1.20:**

  * Added x64 build. 
  * Added 'Missing Process' column, which displays 'Yes' if the process file is missing (On 64-bit systems, you must use the x64 build to get accurate result for this column)
