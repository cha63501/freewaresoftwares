**Publisher's Description**  
  

Glint monitor shows system activity as flash-lights or small graphs by using
system performance counters in local or remote computer.

It also displays the most active processes in system in descending CPU
activity order. Counters names and last values are shown in tool tips.
Settings dialogs allow to select counters and indicators colors along with
other attributes.

More than 200 indicators can be active at once.

**What's New in version 1.28:**

  * Added mouse tooltip to Active Processes indicator. The tooltip contains average CPU usage and amount of I/O data transfer for last 60 seconds (the interval is configurable). 
  * Added option 'Show system task activity' into General_Options settings dialog, that adds system processes, including Glint itself, to Active Processes tooltip. 
  * Added option 'Activity tracking time' into General_Options settings dialog, that sets the activity time interval for Active Processes tooltip. 
  * Removed 'Brightness coefficient' option from General_Options settings dialog. The brightness of glinting lights is still configurable from the keyboard by Up and Down arrows. 
  * Fixed too frequent tooltip updates in Vista and Win7.
