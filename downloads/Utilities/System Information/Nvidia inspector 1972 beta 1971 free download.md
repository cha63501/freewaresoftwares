**WhatA's New in version 1.9.7.2 Beta:**

  * inspector now always requires admin rights since nvidia decided to accept all overclocking actions just in an elevated process enviroment for drivers R325 and above. :( 
  * changed MDPS startup to make use of TaskScheduler instead of shortcut 
  * changed A'Create Startup ShortcutA' feature for clock startup to make use of TaskScheduler too ( rightclick A'Create Clocks ShortcutA' ) (you have to remove your old startup shortcuts manually) 
  * added lod bias adjustment for OpenGL 
  * added FERMI_SETREDUCECOLORTHRESHOLDSENABLE as A'Antialiasing fixA' to avoid black edges in some games while using MSAA (R320.14+) 
  * added OverrideDefault property to CustomSettingNames structure 
  * added total card power level (normalized) to sensor monitoring (R314+) 
  * changed MDPS to run always in legacy mode but with enabled A'add by gpu processA' feature
