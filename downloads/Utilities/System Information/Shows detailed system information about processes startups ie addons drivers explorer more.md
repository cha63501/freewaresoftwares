If you want to keep your computer working in top condition, then you must know the processes and programs it runs. System Explorer is a powerful free system information tool that provides in-depth analysis of a computer to help in knowing what is going on behind the scenes. You can use it to know the drivers installed in the system being analyzed, the number of active processes and startup applications among others. You can then manage your system better for optimum performance. 

**Main Features of System Explorer:**

  * Provides comprehensive information about processes, tasks, modules, services, startups, connections, drivers, opened files, windows, uninstallers and IE Addons 
  * Monitoring system changes and process activities easily 
  * Checking suspicious files via VirusTotal service or File Database 
  * Displaying the usage of important system resources through graphs 
  * Providing detailed status of system and battery 
  * System Additional Info and WMI Browser 
  * Multilanguage support 

System Explorer has an intuitive interface with tabs located on top of the main window. We found it relatively easy to use all features of this startup manager. While its features will please seasoned users, this makes it equally suitable for beginners.

We customized the tab bar to display the details we were interested in. In addition to customizing the programAs appearance, we also adjusted how it worked. We even set it as our default task manager. We used the startup manager to delete unwanted items from the startup menu and deactivate processes we were not using.

Besides System ExplorerAs ability to provide detailed information, we liked its ability to scan running processes for any suspicious activity. Of course, this feature requires an Internet connection to access the online security database. Jotti and VirusTotal services scan all processes online, which is good since the database is always updated to ensure you get the best security possible.

This free system information tool provided more information than we expected. If we needed more information than the program provided, it gave us the option to get more details from Google. Each tab provides a lot of information, complete with useful tips and graphs that not only provide details but also make them easier to understand. The program kept us abreast of what was happening on our system in real time.

While System Explorer provides lots of information, it uses low system resources and runs pretty fast. You can download the program and use it for either personal or commercial services free of charge. You may choose either the installer or portable version. It supports 29 languages and is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8 operating systems.
