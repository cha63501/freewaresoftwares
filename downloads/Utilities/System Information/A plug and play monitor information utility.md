**Publisher's Description**  
  


Monitor Asset Manager is a Plug and Play monitor information utility that works under all 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows. It is fully multi-monitor-capable, and unlike similar reporting utilities queries the monitor directly rather than relying on potentially dubious information stored in the registry. In addition to providing detailed information on monitor color and timing characteristics, this compact utility (400kb) is the only program of its type to accomplish this under Windows NT 4.0, providing corporate IS managers with a simple tool to track monitor inventory by serial number. 

Reports generated by Monitor Asset Manager provide detailed technical information about the target display device and its capabilities. Corporate licensed versions of this lightweight utility can be set to run periodically in the background where it can silently save reports in SMS-compliant MIF file format to designated locations at pre-specified intervals. An IS manager wishing to implement SMS-compliant asset management and inventory practices will find that Monitor Asset Manager is the perfect tool to compliment existing management capabilities.

Moreover, end users puzzled by the way Windows treats their monitors and high-definition display devices can gain insight into exactly what Plug-and-Play means: all the information provided by the display to the system is displayed in readable format, including DPM and GTF/CVT support, color chromaticity values, native and recommended resolutions with exact timing parameters, as well as device minimum requirements and maximum limits. The latest version also extracts and decodes EIA/CEA-861 extension data for consumer electronics devices like HDTVs, as well as basic Monitor Command and Control (MCCS) information from next-generation DDC/CI compliant monitors.
