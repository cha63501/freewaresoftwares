**Publisher's Description**  
  


QUIKGRID is a program which will read in a set of scattered data points (x, y, z) which represents a surface. The program will generate a grid from this data and then display the surface as a contour map, or as a coloured 3d grid. The left mouse button may be used to zoom in and pan about the display. The right mouse button may be used to display information about the generated grid coordinates and data points. 

The grid and contour lines may be exported in a variety of formats, including DXF. QuikGrid is fast, easy to use and will run on modest hardware platforms. QuikGrid is documented through its help facility.
