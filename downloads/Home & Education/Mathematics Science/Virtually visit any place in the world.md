**Publisher's Description**  
  


World Wind lets you zoom from satellite altitude into any place on Earth. Leveraging Landsat satellite imagery and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data, World Wind lets you experience Earth terrain in visually rich 3D, just as if you were really there. Virtually visit any place in the world. Look across the Andes, into the Grand Canyon, over the Alps, or along the African Sahara. 

**Note:** World Wind benefits most from a video card with 3D acceleration. If you donA't know whether your machine comes with one, it is likely to have one built in if the computer was purchased within the past two years.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
