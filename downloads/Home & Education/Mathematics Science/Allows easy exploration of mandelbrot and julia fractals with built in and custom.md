**Publisher's Description**  
  


This Mandelbrot and Julia set explorer allows you to zoom into areas of the Mandelbrot Set and the family of Julia Sets. You can use the mouse for easy visual exploration, or you can fine-tune the areas you view using one of the Navigation Plug-ins. 

The images are displayed in color, either using one of the standard color schemes, or by developing your own using the new layer-based color engine.

Parameter files and the resulting images can be saved to disc. You can also save entire series of images, using a zoom tool. Mandelbrot Explorer can be set to magnify fractals at random, choosing areas likely to be interesting. New to version 3 is a feature that estimates how long a calculation is likely to take, and that allows you to cancel midway through if an operation is taking longer than you want.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html).
