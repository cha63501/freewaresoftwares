**Publisher's Description**  
  


Diffraction Lab Basic is a real-time 3D simulation of wave diffraction in a lab bench setup. It demonstrates diffraction from a square aperture, square array of point sources and two and three point sources on a circle. 

The simulation generates diffraction patterns for the Fresnel limit, Fraunhofer limit and any intermediate value. Numerical data can be taken from the diffraction patterns so it provides an experimental setup to compare against wave diffraction theory.

Runs on XP and higher with graphics that supports Direct3D 9 and vertex shader 3 and pixel shader 3.
