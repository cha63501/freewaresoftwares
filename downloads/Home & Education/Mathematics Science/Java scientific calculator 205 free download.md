**Publisher's Description**  
  

Java Scientific Calculator is a general-purpose scientific calculator that you
can use as a computer-desktop calculator or in a web application. In addition
to basic arithmetic functions it provides trigonometric functions, logarithms,
powers and roots, complex numbers, binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal
calculations, logic, scientific notation, memory, statistical funcions (mean,
and population and sample standard deviations), permutations and combinations.
It also supports editing and replay of input and copying of output to the
(system) clipboard. You can resize the application to one of three sizes and
use the keyboard instead of the mouse for all keys.

Java Scientific Calculator was originally designed as part of a web
application to show how you can use a calculator to calculate confidence
intervals. This is why it has statistical functions and behaves in a similar
way to pocket scientific calculators. At the time I could find no other
suitable calculator and I know of no other calculator that implements
statistical functions.

The interface is created in Java 2 1.5 available from java.sun.com and uses a
Java Swing interface. It also uses many features in Java 2 1.5 that are not
available in earlier versions of Java. Consequently, you will need to make
substantial modifications if you wish to compile it with earlier versions of
Java or with the current version of gcj.

Requires: [Java 2 1.5](http://java.sun.com/)
