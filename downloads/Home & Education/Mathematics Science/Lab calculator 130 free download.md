**Publisher's Description**  
  

Lab Calculator is a lab utility useful for verifying routine lab calculations
involving concentration, mass, volume and common ratios.

The principle behind the calculator is that you must never do any routine
calculation more than once (unless of course you really love doing it). Lab
math is simple, but it can also be annoying and time consuming.

Lab Calculator saves you the trouble by doing most of the work for you. All
you have to do is enter the right values, watch your units and let the program
take care of the rest.

**Features:**

  * Simple tabbed navigation between features 
  * Small size 
  * No need for installation; just double-click the exe 
  * Windows 7/Vista/XP 

**What's New in version 1.30:**

  * Enhanced user interface (to make the tabs touch-friendly for Windows 7) 
  * Added Unit Converter for mass and concentration 
  * Incorporated Wolfram Alpha search for molecular weight (requires internet connection) 
  * Other minor fixes
