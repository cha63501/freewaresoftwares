  * Dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, and barometric pressure 
  * Dry bulb and dew point temperatures, and barometric pressure 
  * Dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure 
  * Dry bulb temperature, humidity ratio, and barometric pressure 
  * Dry bulb temperature, enthalpy, and barometric pressure 
  * Dry bulb temperature, specific volume, and barometric pressure 
All calculations are based on the psychrometric equations in the ASHRAE handbook-fundamentals. GaX Psychrometrics is a Java based program. It should be able to run on any OS with JRE installed.
