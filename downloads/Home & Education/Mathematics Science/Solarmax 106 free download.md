**Publisher's Description**  
  

SolarMax is a complete simulation of the solar system. ItA's a fun way to
learn about space and experience the vastness of our galaxy. You can use it to
track the night sky where you live and know exactly where the stars and
planets are, right now or in the future.

**Features:**

  * All planets, dwarf planets, and major moons simulated. 
  * Views relative to the ecliptic, any planetA's surface, or from "above" the solar system. 
  * All stars visible to the naked eye (over 8000 of them!) 
  * Constellations in traditional or new patterns. Even fly to distant stars and see constellations from a different perspective. 
  * Real-time or speed up time, or even go backwards in time. 
  * Highly accurate - uses NASA ephemeris data with a high precision physics model that is accurate to within thousands of an arc-second. 
  * Easy to use: simple keystroke commands and no options dialogs (Just hit F1 to see the command list). 
  * Fly around the solar system or across the galaxy with a single keypress.
