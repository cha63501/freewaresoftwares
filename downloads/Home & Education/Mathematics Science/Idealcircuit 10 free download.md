**Publisher's Description**  
  

idealCircuit is an analog circuit simulator working with true ideal
components. It uses exactly the same unique and robust algorithm as NL5
Circuit Simulator (nl5.sidelinesoft.com). However, it is simplified as much as
possible: very simple and intuitive interface, less components and models, no
fancy and powerful features.
