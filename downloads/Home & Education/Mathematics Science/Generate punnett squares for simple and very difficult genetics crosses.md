**Publisher's Description**  
  


Bifido Punnett Square Calculator is a very powerful and fast genetic calculator. With this program, you can easily generate punnett squares for very difficult genetics crosses and simulate ratio and probability for offspring in real genetics experiments. Because of the special algorithm, you get absolutely correct results less than one second. 

You can use more than one letter to designate the alleles in the parental genotypes and use "+" sign for the dominant alleles. With this program, the calculation of punnett squares will no longer be hard work for you. The program has many rich features. This professional tool gives you great opportunities for solving not only simple mendelian crosess, but genetics problems for linkage, polygenic inheritance and polyploidy. And with a powerful mechanism of a traits file, it is possible to solve a problems for genes interactions crosses, like incomplete dominance, codominance, epistasis and polygenic inheritance. For these purposes, you can use the prepared examples files and write your own traits files. 

Besides the punnett square calculator youA'll find useful extensions, Crossing Over Map Calculator (to determine the distance between genes (up to three genes) on genetic map with crossing over process), Fruit Fly Gender Calculator (for to determine the gender of fruit flies - Drosophila melanogaster) and Recombination Progeny Calculator(to determine how many progeny in the screen you need for find at least one recombination progeny). 

Use this software you increase your knowledge in the genetics and have a better understanding of the principles of genetics and save your time.

**WhatA's New in version 4.0:**

  * Unicode support. You can write parents genotypes using unicode symbols ( by your native language ). 
  * The calculator saves its settings on exit. 
  * In the help file now included all tutorials from the site. 
  * Fixed a bug with designation of polygenes without special characters and applying the A'+A' character.
