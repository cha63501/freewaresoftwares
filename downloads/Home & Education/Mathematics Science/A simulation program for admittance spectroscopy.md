**Publisher's Description**  
  


AdmittanceModel is a simulation program for admittance spectroscopy. It uses the equivalent circuit of a PN or Schottky junction to calculate the admittance with a possibility to obtain the parameters by fitting experimental data. 

AdmittanceModel uses some SigmaGraph functionality: editable datasheets; scientific graphing with a complete control of the graph; curve fitting (with two levels); drawing tools (line, rectangle, ellipse); mathematical console; etc.

AdmittanceModel is free of charge.
