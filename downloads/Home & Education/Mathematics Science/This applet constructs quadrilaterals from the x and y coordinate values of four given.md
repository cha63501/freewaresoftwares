**Publisher's Description**  
  


This applet constructs quadrilaterals from the x and y coordinate values of four given points, and also determines the category of the constructed quadrilateral (rectangle, square etc.). 

The points are plotted counterclockwise. For convenience a set of sample data is given:  
100 100 200 100 200 200 100 200.

In this applet, a trapezium is a quadrilateral having only one pair of its opposite sides parallel, a trapezoid having none of its sides parallel. Please enable and open the Java Console to get the lengths and the slopes of the lines drawn.
