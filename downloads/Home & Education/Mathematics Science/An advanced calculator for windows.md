**Publisher's Description**  
  


The DME calculator is an advanced calculator for Windows. It is a part of the program package for controlling our instruments. However, in its basic version it can be of use for anyone who wishes to make calculations with a PC or wishes to solve somewhat more complex problems without having to use a large spreadsheet program package. 

The DME calculator fits nearly on a diskette (about 2 MB) and starts without any notable waiting time. Since version 3, the calculator has a built in Graphical User Inteface (GUI) editor. This allowes easy creation of dialog windows with buttons, scroll bars and edit files which then can be interactively controlled by the user program.

You can use the DME Calculator e.g. for simply adding numbers. Compared to the built-in Windows calculator it has the advantage of a large field for entering so you can see all numbers and afterwards easily find errors etc.

For more complex calculations, you can enter the whole expression as e.g. sin(pi()/4)^2 (Result is 0.5). 

**Features:**

  * Since version 3: Creation of own user interfaces with the built-in GUI editor 
  * Nonlinear data modeling by an adapted Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (see fit() function) 
  * Fast fourier transforms 
  * Calculation and display of results in the hexadecimal and binary systems 
  * Use of variables, see above 
  * 2D graphic functions with export of subtotals, display of more graphs on top of each other or in separate windows 
  * Text function for showing subtotals or other texts 
  * Definition of own functions, e.g. with define(f(x);2*x) , which means f(x) := 2*x; recursive programming is explicitly allowed. 
  * Functions for flow control as in programming languages, e.g. if, for, foreach,while 
  * Text data in and output for text in columns or normal text 
  * Functions for serial communication over the PCA's RS232 interface. 
  * More programs / expressions can be entered at the same time 
  * Syntax validation during entering 
  * High calculation speed 
  * Online help (in English) with examples to try out 
  * Execution of external programs; as an example, you get the actual date by entering execute(A'cmd /C date /TA';A'A') 
  * IEEE 488 Bus communication (requires an interface board compatible with National InstrumentA's GPIB)
