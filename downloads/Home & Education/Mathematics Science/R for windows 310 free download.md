**Publisher's Description**  
  

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling,
classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering,
...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is
often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R
provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

One of RA's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality
plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where
needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design
choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.

**Features:**

  * an effective data handling and storage facility, 
  * a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices, 
  * a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis, 
  * graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and 
  * a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.
