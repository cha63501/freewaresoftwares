**Publisher's Description**  
  


ATCalc is a free complex graphic calculator with programming environment. 

Write the calculations you wish to make on one line: you can thus see and write, for example (12*3)/(4+2+8) and (this feature is the one that makes the difference from conventional calculators) you can review if they have been correctly typed.

ATCalc is addressed to:

  * People that donA't want to make life more difficult than it should be, allowing them to see the numbers they have entered and obtained (and therefore review them) and visualize (and copy) the list of results obtained. 
  * Students and professionals wanting a very potent and versatile calculator, also itA's programming environment and possibility of representing equations and drawings. 
  * Secondary school professors who want to introduce their students in the structured programming. 

Visualize (and optionally copy to the clipboard) the calculations, variables and results which have been employed.

Apart from the operators (addition, subtraction, etc.), you may use a multitude of functions: all the usual arithmetic functions, logarithmic, trigonometric, statistical, random numbers, and logical options.

**What's New in version 3.1.9.7:**

  * Two sizes in the image of the checkboxes and radio buttons (according to the font size). 
  * Added shortcut to the bug report. Resolved an error. .
