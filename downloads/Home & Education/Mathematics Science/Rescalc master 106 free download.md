Resistors have color codes that help people determine their respective values
and tolerances. However, mastering all the color codes requires significant
investment in terms of effort and time. Fortunately, ResCalc Master allows
anyone to determine these values easily. The simple resistor calculator is
designed for all people who use resistors irrespective of their level of
electronic knowledge.

**ResCalc MasterAs Features**

  * EIA standard value table 
  * Color code table with decoding example 
  * Supports resistors with between three and six bands 
  * The latest version supports LED resistors 
  * Automatic checking of updates 

**Using ResCalc Master**

ResCalc Master is designed for 32-bit Windows operating systems, and it is
compatible with Windows 2000 upwards.

The program allowed us to do different things, including:

  * Determining the values of resistors depending on their colors 
  * Determining the colors of resistors based on their respective values 
  * Determining resistor standards depending on their values 

We could also determine the total value of resistors depending on their
connections. While you may know how to calculate the values of resistors
connected in either series or parallel, the calculations take some time. With
ResCalc Master, you only need to enter the respective values of the resistors
and press the ACalculateA button to get the answer you want.

We started our calculations by selecting the number of bands the resistors
had. We then selected corresponding colors, and the program automatically
displayed the values on the top right part of its interface. It also displayed
a graphic representation of the resistors, which made it easy for us to
confirm that we had selected the right colors. We simply compared the resistor
with the image displayed to determine whether they were similar or not.

We performed reverse calculations by entering values of resistors, and the
program displayed their appropriate color codes. This feature can come
especially handy to amateurs who want to get the right resistors for their
projects.

ResCalc Master is also ideal for people who want to learn resistor color
codes. The included color code table makes it easy for newcomers to understand
how to make calculations. It includes a six-band resistor decoding example
that helps in explaining how to determine values, including tolerances and
temperature coefficients. The calculator also shows how resistor orientational
dimensions are dependent on the strength of dissipation.

**Conclusion**

ResCalc Master is a powerful resistor calculator that makes it easy for anyone
to determine the values of resistors based on their color codes or vice versa.
It is also a great tutor for anyone who wants to master the resistor color
code.
