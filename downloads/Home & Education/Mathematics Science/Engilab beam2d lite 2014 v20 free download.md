**Publisher's Description**  
  

EngiLab Beam.2D is an easy-to-use yet powerful engineering tool for the linear
static analysis of plane (2D) frames for Windows.

It features a full Graphical User Interface (GUI) for pre-processing or post-
processing and uses the Finite Element Method (FEM) for plane frames for its
analysis purposes.

The program can draw the Axial Force, Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams
of the Model and also draw the Deformed state of the Model.

**Modeling limitations:** The Lite Edition can open, save and modify any structural Model. Its input files are exactly the same as the ones of the Pro Edition. Yet, the Lite Edition can analyze only small Models of up to 10 Nodes, 3 Materials and 3 Sections.

**System requirements:**

  * [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html)
  * Processor 1 GHz, RAM 512 MB, Disk space 100 MB, Display dimensions 800x600
