**Publisher's Description**  
  


TTCalc is an open source bignum mathematical calculator. 

It features arithmetical functions, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, inverse hyperbolic functions, logical operators, logarithms, functions for converting between degrees and radians and so on. Additionally the program allows a user to define his own variables and functions.

The program possesses an easy to use interface. Calculations are performed by using binary floating point numbers with three kinds of precision, the biggest has 1024 bits for its mantissa and 128 bits for its exponent that is about 9.805180 * 10^51217599719369681875006054625051616657 with 306 valid decimal digits. TTCalc independently allows to insert and display values with the base (radix) from two to sixteen. 

**WhatA's New in version 0.9.3:**

  * added: German translation made by Moritz Beleites 
  * added: on display tab: an option how many digits should be grouped 
  * changed: the way how buttons on display tab work suppose we have A'123+34+56A' in the first edit, then select (by mouse or a keyboard) A'123+34A' similar as you would like to copy them to the clipboard, then press a button let we say A'sinA' - the result is: A'sin(123+34)+56A' 
  * updated: Chinese translation 
  * fixed: ttcalc didnA't correctly delete variables/functions from its config file so when you restarted the program you still had the deleted variables/functions 
  * fixed: option: A'parameters separated byA' was not correctly read from the config file
