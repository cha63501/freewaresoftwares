**Publisher's Description**  
  

Halley is a free software for management and working with the regularly
updated database of comets, containing Keplerian orbital elements, non-
gravitational and physical parameters of the comets and other data.

The tasks performed by Halley software, in addition to database management,
include calculation of the orbital evolution of small-bodies and visualization
of their dynamics, detection of close approaches with the major planets in a
given time interval, as well as a number of other tasks.

**Features:**

  * **Regular Updates** \- Regularly updated database of comets.. 
  * **Fast Search** \- Fast search of comets by any element. 
  * **High Precision** \- High-precision calculation of small-bodies orbits. 
  * **High Speed** \- High-speed integration of the equations of motion. 
  * **And more features** \- Complete database management with possibility of adding your own objects, visualization of small-bodies orbits, calculation of orbital evolution, moments of perihelion passages, close approaches and more. 

**Note:** When you start Halley first time, the A'Get StartedA' window appears. You will be prompted to install one or more of the planetary numerical ephemerides: JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides DE406 (190MB) or/and DE423 (35MB).
