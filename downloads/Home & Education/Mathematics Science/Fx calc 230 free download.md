**Publisher's Description**  
  

Although Windows comes with a built-in calculator, you may want to perform
more calculations than the application can handle. fx-Calc is a simple
application that is smaller than the native Windows calculator, but it is
versatile enough to handle complex calculations easily.

**How to Use fx-Calc**

The calculator has an editor field where you need to type in what you want to
calculate. It performs calculations in real time, and you will see the results
as you type. If you make some mistakes, it will display text in red color and
provide a specific error message in the results pane. The interpreter is case-
sensitive.

If you are making simple calculations, press either Enter or the Calculate
button after entering your desired task.

You can theoretically enter unlimited parentheses levels in mathematical
expressions, thanks to the applicationA's use of dynamic memory, which is not
a problem with modern computers. This means you can use multiple functions and
brackets. You can even use self-defined functions, and fx-Calc will
automatically detect variables as you type.

The application supports further functionalities, including analyzing
functions and plotting functions in either 2D or 3D. It also supports memory
function, which means you can store a value and recall it later for other
calculations. It displays the current memory value in a separate field.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html).

**WhatA's New in version 2.3.0:**

  * bug in thread handling fixed (caused a possible exception at application closing) 
  * sum and product do not create history entries for each index range change anymore 
  * a bug with the font on the minus (-) button under XP was solved 
  * sum and product do not calculate at each tiny change anymore, the calculation needs to be started by using the green RUN button 
  * the initial file with an example db for functions covers now the following Pi calculation: 
    * S(0;1000;f(n)=((-1)^n/4^n)*(2/(4*n+1)+2/(4*n+2)+1/(4*n+3))) 
    * S(0;10000;f(n)=4*((-1)^n)/(2*n+1))
