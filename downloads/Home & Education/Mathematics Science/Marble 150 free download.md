**Publisher's Description**  
  

Marble is a Virtual Globe and World Atlas that you can use to learn more about
Earth: You can pan and zoom around and you can look up places and roads. A
mouse click on a place label will provide the respective Wikipedia article.

Of course itA's also possible to measure distances between locations or watch
the current cloud cover. Marble offers different thematic maps: A classroom-
style topographic map, a satellite view, street map, earth at night and
temperature and precipitation maps. All maps include a custom map key, so it
can also be used as an educational tool for use in class-rooms. For
educational purposes you can also change date and time and watch how the
starry sky and the twilight zone on the map change.

In opposite to other virtual globes Marble also features multiple projections:
Choose between a Flat Map ("Plate carrA(c)"), Mercator or the Globe.

The best of all: Marble is Free Software / Open Source Software and promotes
the usage of [free maps](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).
