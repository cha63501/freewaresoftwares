**Publisher's Description**  
  

AdmittanceModel is a simulation program for admittance spectroscopy. It uses
the equivalent circuit of a PN or Schottky junction to calculate the
admittance with a possibility to obtain the parameters by fitting experimental
data.

AdmittanceModel uses some SigmaGraph functionality: editable datasheets;
scientific graphing with a complete control of the graph; curve fitting (with
two levels); drawing tools (line, rectangle, ellipse); mathematical console;
etc.

AdmittanceModel is free of charge.
