**Publisher's Description**  
  

Earth Alerts is a Windows-based application that provides alert notifications
and information on all weather, earthquake, and volcano related events. These
events are tracked anywhere within the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, and
the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Weather, earthquakes, and volcanos...the kind of stuff our planet dishes out
to arouse human curiosity and, occasionally, fear. Fortunately for us, we have
organizations like the National Weather Service and the U.S. Geological Survey
to study and track EarthA's natural wonders, and then warn us whenever the
Earth starts misbehaving!

To use Earth Alerts, you simply select the specific Locations you are
interested in. The application will then automatically retrieve the latest
weather, earthquake, and/or volcano information from various live data feeds
on the Internet, and then present it to you.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
