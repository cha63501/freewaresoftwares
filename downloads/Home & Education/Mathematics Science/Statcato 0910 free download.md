**Publisher's Description**  
  

Statcato is a free Java software application developed for elementary
statistical computations. Its features are tailored for community college
statistics students and instructors.

**Basic data operations include:**

  * Sort, rank, standardize data 
  * Generate patterned data (simple number sequence and arbitrary data sequence) 
  * Generate random samples (e.g.binomial, uniform, integer, normal distributions) 

**Probability calculations (probability density, cumulative probability, inverse cumulative probability) are supported for the following distributions:**

  * Continuous: Normal, StudentA's t, Chi-square, F, uniform 
  * Discrete: Binomial, geometric, integer, Poisson 

**The following statistical computations are supported:**

  * Descriptive statistics (e.g. mean, sum, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, quartiles, skewness, kurtosis, etc.) 
  * Normality test (Ryan-Joiner) 
  * Sample size determination for mean and proportion 
  * Confidence intervals for one- and two-population mean, proportion, and variance 
  * Hypothesis Tests for one- and two-population mean, proportion, and variance 
  * Correlation and regression (two-variable linear and non-linear regression, multiple linear regression) 
  * Multinomial experiments (Chi-square goodness-of-fit, contingency table, cross tabulation) 
  * Analysis of variance (one-way and two-way ANOVA) 
  * Nonparametrics (sign test, Wilcoxon signed rank and rank sum test, Kruskal-Wallis, rank correlation, runs test) 
Statcato also provides a calculator and utilities for creating graphs,
including bar chart, box plot, dot plot, histogram, normal quantile plot, pie
chart, scatterplot, and stem plot.

Requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6+ or above. [Get It
