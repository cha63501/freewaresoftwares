**Publisher's Description**  
  

AnimatLab is a software tool that combines biomechanical simulation and
biologically realistic neural networks.

You can build the body of an animal, robot, or other machine and place it in a
virtual world where the physics of its interaction with the environment are
accurate and realistic. You can then design a nervous system that controls the
behavior of the body in the environment.

The software currently has support for simple firing rate and leaky integrate
and fire spiking neural models. In addition, there a number of different
synapse model types that can be used to connect the various neural models to
produce your nervous system.

On the biomechanics side there is support for a variety of different rigid
body types, including custom meshes that can be made to match skeletal
structures exactly. The biomechanics system also has hill-based muscle and
muscle spindle models. These muscle models allow the nervous system to produce
movements around joints.

In addition, there are also motorized joints for those interested in
controlling robots or other biomimetic machines. This allows the user to
generate incredibly complicated artificial lifeforms, otherwise known as
animats, that are based on real biological systems. Best of all AnimatLab is
completely free and it includes free source code!
