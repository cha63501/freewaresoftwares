**Publisher's Description**  
  


Sprimer is a mathematical oddity which was designed to search for a pattern to prime numbers. Currently, no known pattern exists. The program does this by plotting numbers on a grid and spiraling outward as in the example below. 

Only numbers that are prime will be seen, highlighted in white. All other numbers will be masked in black. The center of the spiral will be in blue. A pattern of diagonal lines will develop, especially when the number 41 is chosen as the center. This program can graphically plot prime numbers with a center number ranging from 1 to 1,000,000.
