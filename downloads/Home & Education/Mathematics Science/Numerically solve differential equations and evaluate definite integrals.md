**Publisher's Description**  
  


SolveDiffEq is a standalone application which allows you to numerically solve differential equations and evaluate definite integrals of your choosing. 

Using the Runge-Kutta method, SolveDiffEq can solve any number of coupled differential equations of the form:

  * dx(0)/dt = f(0)(t, x(0), x(1), . . .) 
  * dx(1)/dt = f(1)(t, x(0), x(1), . . . ) 

SolveDiffEqA's Help menu shows how to input a script defining the functions f(0), f(1), . . . so as to numerically solve differential equations of any order or to numerically evaluate any one variable definite integral. Your script is translated into machine language for fast calculation. 

**WhatA's New in version 3.6:**

  * corrects a bug when 'delta t' is a negative number.
