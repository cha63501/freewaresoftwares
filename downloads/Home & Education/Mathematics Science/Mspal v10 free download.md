**Publisher's Description**  
  

MSPal is a program for the storage, maintenance and analysis of both low- and
high resolution MS spectra. This embedded SQLite application has powerful
search- and filter capabilities and offers a nifty routine to compare MS
spectra of structurally related compounds, thereby facilitating both the
structure elucidation, and profiling of groups of compounds as is demonstrated
with the illegal drugs of the amphetamine- and opiate- series. MS spectra can
be tailored and saved to editable bitmaps, suitable for publication in papers
or on posters.

Likewise, numerical data of spectra can be imported from www databases or
exported to contribute to those sites. The database harbours tables of well
known charged and neutral fragments, which are constantly consulted in the
analysis of spectra. MSPal also features utilities like a fragment finder,
exact masses calculator and a possible metastable ion predictor.
