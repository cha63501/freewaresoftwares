**Publisher's Description**  
  

Scilab was designed to be a scientific software package for numerical
computations providing a powerful open computing environment for engineering
and scientific applications.

Scilab is an open source software. Since 1994 it has been distributed freely
along with the source code via the Internet. It is currently used in
educational and industrial environments around the world. Scilab is now the
responsibility of the Scilab Consortium, launched in May 2003. There are
currently 25 members in Scilab Consortium.

Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions with the possibility to add
interactively programs from various languages (C, C++, Fortran). It has
sophisticated data structures (including lists, polynomials, rational
functions, linear systems...), an interpreter and a high level programming
language.

**Features:**

  * 2-D and 3-D graphics, animation 
  * Linear algebra, sparse matrices 
  * Polynomials and rational functions 
  * Interpolation, approximation 
  * Simulation: ODE solver and DAE solver 
  * Scicos: a hybrid dynamic systems modeler and simulator 
  * Classic and robust control, LMI optimization 
  * Differentiable and non-differentiable optimization 
  * Signal processing 
  * Metanet: graphs and networks 
  * Parallel Scilab 
  * Statistics 
  * Interface with Computer Algebra: Maple package for Scilab code generation 
  * Interface with Fortran, Tcl/Tk, C, C++, Java, LabVIEW 
  * And a large number of contributions for various domains
