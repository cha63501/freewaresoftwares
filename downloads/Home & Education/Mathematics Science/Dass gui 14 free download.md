**Publisher's Description**  
  

DASS-GUI is a stand-alone program written in C++ that calculates all
significant closed sets* of a given dataset containing the host sets. Some of
the used algorithms are taken from Hollunder et al. (2007).

DASS-GUI also allows additional analyses of the identified closed sets:
filtering, handling of synonymous names, enrichment analyses, calculation of
means and standard deviations of different numerical features, extraction of
the underlying closed set hierarchy and corresponding export as GML file, as
well as comparison (validation) with pre-defined sets.

*A set is A'closedA' if there exists no superset with the same frequency containing this set. There might be up to 2n-1 different closed sets (n=# host sets).

**Features:**

  * (A) Calculation Mode: 
  * calculation of significant closed sets (modules) in non-sequential data 
  * (B) Analysis Mode: 
  * additional analyses of the identified closed sets (1-7) 
  * (1) filtering, (2) handling of synonymous names, (3) enrichment 
  * analysis, (4) calculation of means and standard deviations of different 
  * numerical features, (5) clustering and pruning the closed set results, 
  * (6) extraction of the underlying closed set hierarchy and corresponding 
  * export as GML, NET, LIBSEA, or EDGES file, as well as (7) comparison/ 
  * validation with pre-defined sets
