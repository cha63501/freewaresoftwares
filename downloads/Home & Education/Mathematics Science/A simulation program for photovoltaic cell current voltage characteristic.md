**Publisher's Description**  
  


CurrentModel is a simulation program for Photovoltaic cell current-voltage characteristic. 

It uses the two-diode model to calculate the current-voltage characteristic curve of a photovoltaic cell with a possibility to obtain the device parameters by fitting experimental data. 

CurrentModel uses some SigmaGraph functionality: editable datasheets; scientific graphing with a complete control of the graph; curve fitting; drawing tools (line, rectangle, ellipse); mathematical console; etc.

CurrentModel is free of charges.
