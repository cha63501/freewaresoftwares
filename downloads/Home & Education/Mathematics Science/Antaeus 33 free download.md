**Publisher's Description**  
  

Antaeus is a utility that lets you create and explore data plots with ease.
These plots can be used to confirm or deny the merits of statistical analyses
performed from other applications. They can also be used to find patterns in
multivariate data that can only be discovered through the use of visual
investigation.

Antaeus is meant to supplement statistical analyses by allowing investigators
to study the plots that correspond to their formulations, but no statistics is
used within Antaeus itself.

Antaeus is also a platform from which plots may be published. Any plot may be
saved to clipboard or file (when too large for the clipboard) as a Windows
Enhanced Metafile (EMF). These can be embedded in reports, papers, and
presentations created in Microsoft Office products such as Word, PowerPoint
and Publisher.

Support for EMF files is also increasing among non-Microsoft publication
suites. These sophisticated programs are empowered by the use of plots they
cannot possibly construct themselves.

Antaeus runs on Windows Vista, XP, and 7. It is free for academic and non-
commercial use.
