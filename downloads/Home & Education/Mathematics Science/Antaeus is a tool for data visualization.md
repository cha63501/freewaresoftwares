**Publisher's Description**  
  


Antaeus is a utility that lets you create and explore data plots with ease. These plots can be used to confirm or deny the merits of statistical analyses performed from other applications. They can also be used to find patterns in multivariate data that can only be discovered through the use of visual investigation. 

Antaeus is meant to supplement statistical analyses by allowing investigators to study the plots that correspond to their formulations, but no statistics is used within Antaeus itself.

Antaeus is also a platform from which plots may be published. Any plot may be saved to clipboard or file (when too large for the clipboard) as a Windows Enhanced Metafile (EMF). These can be embedded in reports, papers, and presentations created in Microsoft Office products such as Word, PowerPoint and Publisher. 

Support for EMF files is also increasing among non-Microsoft publication suites. These sophisticated programs are empowered by the use of plots they cannot possibly construct themselves.

Antaeus runs on Windows Vista, XP, and 7. It is free for academic and non-commercial use.
