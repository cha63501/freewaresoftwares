**Publisher's Description**  
  

SAOImage DS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application.
DS9 supports FITS images and binary tables, multiple frame buffers, region
manipulation, and many scale algorithms and colormaps. It provides for easy
communication with external analysis tasks and is highly configurable and
extensible.

DS9 is a stand-alone application. It requires no installation or support
files. Versions of DS9 currently exist for Sun Solaris, Linux, Linux64,
MacOSX, and Windows XP. All versions and platforms support a consistent set of
GUI and functional capabilities.

DS9 supports advanced features such as multiple frame buffers, mosaic images,
tiling, blinking, geometric markers, colormap manipulation, scaling, arbitrary
zoom, rotation, pan, and a variety of coordinate systems. DS9 also supports
FTP and HTTP access.

The GUI for DS9 is user configurable. GUI elements such as the coordinate
display, panner, magnifier, horizontal and vertical graphs, button bar, and
colorbar can be configured via menus or the command line.

DS9 is a Tk/Tcl application which utilizes the SAOTk widget set. It also
incorporates the X Public Access (XPA) mechanism to allow external processes
to access and control its data, GUI functions, and algorithms.

New releases of the DS9 binaries, including new features and bug fixes, are
made available 3 times a year on January 15th, April 15th, and October 15th.
