**Publisher's Description**  
  

CHEMMOL (V1.0) is a freeware program for the calculation of molecular masses
and chemical analyses of compounds. It was written with the organic chemist in
mind.

Thus, apart form (most) of the elements a number of organic functional groups
and some protecting groups were added. Likewise, all naturally occuring amino
acids were added to the database. CHEMMOL readily parses inputlines like
CuSO4.Aq5, H2C=CMe-COOPh, [NEt4].[Cl] and even protected peptides like Ac-Pro-
Val-Gly-His-OBn without problems.
