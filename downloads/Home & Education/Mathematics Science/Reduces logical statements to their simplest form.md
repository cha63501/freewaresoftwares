**Publisher's Description**  
  


ItsLogical will take any logical statement that contains Ifs, Elses, ElseIfs, Ands, Ors, Nots, and user entered Statements, and it will attempt to reduce that logical statement to its simplest form. It does not matter how complicated the statement is, ItsLogical can handle any combination of the allowed logical operators without loss in performance. 

Even though it can handle any size statement without trouble, the combinations and permutations that it considers when trying to find alternatives become unwieldy for Visual Basic, so this program can be painfully slow. It generates a massive truth table in Excel to exhaust the truth values for the given statement, and the user decides which logical operator to try next and then checks to see if there is a logical equivalence. 

People who would enjoy this program include math students who are interested in logical equivalences and truth tables should find it fascinating to find the negation of an If-Then-Else statement, or the And-Or equivalent to any If-Then-ElseIf-Else statement, or the reduction of a ridiculously complicated series of Ands, Ors, and Nots to a simple statement of Ands, Ors, and Nots. 

Also, anybody using Excel or similar spreadsheet and has entered a complicated If-Then-Else and wants to see it in tree form, then edit the tree, then send it back to Excel. This is really useful if Excel is telling you that you have missed some parenthesis somewhere and you find yourself desperately guessing, Maybe if I just put a right parenthesis here, it will give me the value I want?
