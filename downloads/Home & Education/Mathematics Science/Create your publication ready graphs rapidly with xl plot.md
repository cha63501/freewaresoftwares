**Publisher's Description**  
  


The primary purpose of XL-Plot is to create a figure rapidly. It is ideal for for use at high school, as the path from data in one or more spreadsheet columns to the final figure is short (just a few mouse clicks) and easy to grasp. It contains basic statistical functions, such as StudentA's t-test and linear correlation of two sets of data (two columns in a spreadsheet). 

XL-Plot has a number of build-in functions that can be fitted to the data in columns on a spreadsheet or to a curve in a graph. The user can easily add fitting functions of his own design. 

Additional options are Fourier transformation, (de-)convolution, eigen decomposition and matrix inversion.
