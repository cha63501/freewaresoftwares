**Publisher's Description**  
  


IRPal is a program that may come in quite handy in interpreting IR-spectra of organic compounds. It includes a small database that is suitable for global assignments of functional groups and structure-elements but the database can be modified, extended and tailored to specific needs. 

The program is self explanatory. Context-sensitive help is available on the statusbar. The database is a TAB-delimited text file that can also be loaded in a number of spreadsheet programs i.e. Excel for sorting or tailoring.
