**Publisher's Description**  
  


Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. With its simple toolbar interface and simulation of circuits as you build them, it is simple enough to facilitate learning the most basic concepts related to logic circuits. With the capacity to build larger circuits from smaller subcircuits, and to draw bundles of wires with a single mouse drag, Logisim can be used (and is used) to design and simulate entire CPUs for educational purposes. 

Logisim is used by students at colleges and universities around the world in many types of classes, ranging from a brief unit on logic in general-education computer science surveys, to computer organization courses, to full-semester courses on computer architecture.

**Features:**

  * It is free! (Logisim is open-source (GPL).) 
  * It runs on any machine supporting Java 1.4 or later; special versions are released for MacOS X and Windows. The cross-platform nature is important for students who have a variety of home/dorm computer systems. 
  * The drawing interface is based on an intuitive toolbar. Color-coded wires aid in simulating and debugging a circuit. 
  * The wiring tool draws horizontal and vertical wires, automatically connecting to components and to other wires. ItA's very easy to draw circuits! 
  * Completed circuits can be saved into a file, exported to a GIF file, or printed on a printer. 
  * Circuit layouts can be used as "subcircuits" of other circuits, allowing for hierarchical circuit design. 
  * Included circuit components include inputs and outputs, gates, multiplexers, arithmetic circuits, flip-flops, and RAM memory. 
  * The included "combinational analysis" module allows for conversion between circuits, truth tables, and Boolean expressions. 

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

**WhatA's New in version 2.7.0:**

  * Feature: Added the option of switching the 'explorer pane' between viewing the 'toolbox' (the project's circuits and libraries that has appeared in the explorer pane in previous versions) and a simulation hierarchy. 
  * Feature: A Greek translation of the GUI elements was added. (The documentation is not yet translated.) 
  * Feature: The attribute table contains a header line describing which attributes are being edited. 
  * Feature: Added a 'Close' item to the Window menu, which closes the current window. The 'Close' item in the File menu continues to close the current project; its shortcut is now Control-Shift-W. 
  * Feature: Added 250 percent, 300 percent, 400 percent to the options for zooming. 
  * Feature: File dialogs 'remember' the location of the last-accessed file, and the next file dialog starts from there - even when Logisim is started again. 
  * Feature: During a rectangular selection, the rectangle is drawn with a light blue, and components that will be affected are indicated with a slate-blue outline. 
  * Design change: Removed option to disable the project toolbar. 
  * Bug fix: In moving a component whose output is connected to itself, it was possible for an exception to cause the program to hang. 
  * Bug fix: The 'Second radix when wire poked' preference was ignored - the 'First radix' was displayed twice when the wire was poked. 
  * Bug fix: Enabled the '-clearprops' command-line option for clearing all application preferences. (The previous version worked with '-clearprefs', but it was described as '-clearprops' in the '-help' text and in the documentation. Both now work.) 
  * Bug fix: The Logging module's window title did not change when the file's name was changed. 
  * Feature: Saving project files is more cautious, creating a backup before starting to write to disk and recovering from the backup if for some reason the save is detected to fail (whether nothing has been written to the file or an error has occurred while saving). 
  * Feature: Individual subcircuit instances can have a label, in addition to the 'shared label' that is displayed in the center of each instance of a subcircuit. 
  * Bug fix: When simulation is disabled, selecting Tick Once will still cause a tick once the simulation is stepped.
