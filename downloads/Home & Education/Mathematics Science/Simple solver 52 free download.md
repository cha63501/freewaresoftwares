Design and analysis of Boolean equations and state machines is often an
extremely complex and time consuming task. Even when a solution is found it
can be very difficult to analyze or modify.

Simple Solver provides a suite of five design tools:

  * Boolean Equation Processor 
  * Permutation Generator 
  * Random Number Generator 
  * Logic Simulator 
  * Automatic Logic Synthesizer 
These tools can be used to minimize, simplify and reduce Boolean equations and
digital logic circuits.
