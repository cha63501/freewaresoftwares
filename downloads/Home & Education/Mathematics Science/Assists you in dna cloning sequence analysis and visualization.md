**Publisher's Description**  
  


Serial Cloner is a Molecular Biology software. It provides tools with an intuitive interface that assists you in DNA cloning, sequence analysis and visualization. 

Serial Cloner reads and write DNA Strider-compatible files and import and export files in the universal FASTA format. Serial Cloner also imports files saved in the Vector NTI, ApE, pDRAW32 and GenBank formats. Import from MacVector is also possible now. 

Powerful graphical display tools and simple interfaces help the analysis and construction steps in a very intuitive way. Serial Cloner handles Annotations and Features both in the sequence and in the Graphic Map.

All the tools you need to analyze and manipulate your sequences are available in an all-in-one-window concept. Numerically select fragments, find restriction sites, ORF or any nucleotide or peptide sequence, calculate Tm of selected fragments, %GC or dynamically determine the translation your selection into peptide and calculate the MW using a compact interface.

Serial Cloner also lets you build text restriction map and quickly format it to add multi-frame translation or only show single cutters for example. With version 2.1, Sequence Features are visible in the Sequence Map. The graphic map of Serial Cloner is really Graphic as you can easily select and extract a fragment or show single, double or multiple cutter all in the same window. 

All the features are displayed on the map using user-modifiable colors; the features can be manually entered, imported from GenBank or automatically found after scanning by Serial Cloner. The Collection of Features to be scanned for can be defined and modified by the user, imported and exported.
