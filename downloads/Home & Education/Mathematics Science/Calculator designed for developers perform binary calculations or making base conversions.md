**Publisher's Description**  
  


Megatops BinCalc is a pure Int32 calculator designed for developers. It provides you a effective way to perform binary calculations or making base conversions. 

BinCalc is FREE, and it looks very different to the other calculators. When I was staring the BinCalc project, I just want to design a UI cool enough to scare the binary "muggles" and avoid them touching it -- it is only for developers.

If you are a embedded system developer or low-level software developer, you might like it. It will rescue you from counting the 0/1s in the stupid Windows Calculator and help you to save the time wasted on parsing the hardware registers or converting from one base to another.

**Features:**

  * unique binary input method 
  * get bin/dec/hex input & display in one screen 
  * supports Intel/Freescale style bit labeling 
  * signed/unsigned int 32 support 
  * octal support 
  * unix file permission indicator 
  * classic 4-level (XYZT) RPN calculator 
  * well designed keyboard input support 

**WhatA's New in version 1.0.3:**

  * Added ASCII char copy & paste support 
  * More hotkeys supported, see Readme.txt for detailed key-mapping info.
