**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Christian Church is growing like never before. Each day around the world, multiple thousands of people are turning to the Lord. 

This 21 lesson course was written in 1998 by Paul, Bunty & David Collins (founders of the Online Bible College). It was designed to equip teachers to cope with the influx of new believers and since then has played an integral part in the birth of many Home Study Groups and Micro Churches and the planting of thousands of Churches across the world.

Welcome to Project 21 - the Word of God made available in an easily distributed PC format, with a clear and simple layout which can be easily photocopied for use in sharing with others.

The APrint ShopA ready PDF version of the course is very useful in places where PCAs are not readily available.

This non-denominational, non-sectarian 21-lesson series will walk you through the essential foundations of the Christian faith.
