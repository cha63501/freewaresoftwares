**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Chinese Lunar Calendar is a yearly one, with the start of the lunar year
being based on the cycles of the moon. Therefore, because of this cyclical
dating, the beginning of the year can fall anywhere between late January and
the middle of February. This year it falls on February 12th. A complete cycle
takes 60 years and is made up of five cycles of 12 years each.

2008 Calendar Chinese New Year performs date conversion between the Gregorian
Solar Calendar and the Chinese Lunar Calendar.

The Chinese Lunar Calendar names each of the twelve years after an animal.
Legend has it that the Lord Buddha summoned all the animals to come to him
before he departed from earth. Only twelve came to bid him farewell and as a
reward he named a year after each one in the order they arrived. The Chinese
believe the animal ruling the year in which a person is born has a profound
influence on personality, saying: "This is the animal that hides in your
heart."
