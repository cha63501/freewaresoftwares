This is a very empowering package! It contains the TruthA's of Grace and Freedom of the Gospel of Jesus. Yet compiled in an easy to use format which is ideal for home or group study. What is the Gospel? 

Most Christians have a rudimentary understanding of the Gospel. After all, in order to become a Christian, you need to understand the Gospel, right? 

Well, half right. Yes, in order to experience GodA's salvation, you need to have an understanding of how God saves you, which is a vital part of the Gospel. But the Gospel is far more than this. The Gospel also describes the parameters within which God relates to you and works within your life. 

Colossians 1:6, The Gospel keeps bringing blessings and is spreading throughout the world, just as it has among you ever since the day you first heard about the grace of God and came to know it as it really is. Note how Paul connects the fact that the Gospel is bearing fruit and growing to the fact that the early believers understood GodA's grace in all its truth. Like the love of Christ, the grace of God has awesome length, breadth, height and depth (see Ephesians 3:18). 

In this study, we explore the length, breadth, height and depth of the Gospel so that we can begin to understand GodA's grace in all its truth. 

The result of this revelation is that the Gospel will begin to bear fruit and grow like we have never experienced before. The Gospel of Jesus- Grace and Freedom - Ideal for home or group study.
