**Publisher's Description**  
  

Memorizing Scripture verses is a laudable ambition, but a beginner can find it
overwhelming.

**_InVerse_** simplifies this, containing over 15,300 verses preloaded in 2,800 of the best known Scripture passages from 11 different Bible translations. As your proficiency on a passage improves from _Just Started_ to _Good_ and then _Mastered_, you can categorize it for _Less Frequent_ or _Least Frequent_ recitation. Veteran memorizers benefit by being able to organize scores of passages between _Learning_, _Learned_, and _Archive_.

**_Inverse_** lets you choose whether to see just the reference _(e.g. John 3:16 [Topic:Grace] NIV)_, a hint, or the passage being memorized. If you want a better sense of the meaning, a quick mouse click will show the context as it appears in the Bible, with verses that come before and/or after.

**_Inverse_** has a very simple, intuitive user interface (no typing!). An extensive tutorial (100+ steps) is oriented to less experienced computer users. Early in the tutorial, each and every mouse click is described. Detailed _Help_ is provided, including context sensitive help.

God is pleased when followers of the Lord Jesus Christ have a growing knowlege
of His Bible, His Son, and His message of salvation and repentance for a lost
and dying world.
