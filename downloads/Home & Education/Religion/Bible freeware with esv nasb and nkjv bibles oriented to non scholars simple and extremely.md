**Publisher's Description**  
  


**_BerBible_** is simplified freeware that includes a number of Bibles at no cost: 

  * NASB (New American Standard BIble A(c)1995 from The Lockman Foundation)
  * NKJV (New King James Version A(c)1982 from Thomas Nelson, Inc.
  * BerBible is the only non-commercial freeware of its kind that is able to provide either the NASB or NKJV as free downloads.
  * ESV (English Standard Version A(c)2001 from Good News & Crossway Publishers).
  * Also KJV, ASV, AKJV, BBE, Webster, WEB, and YLT   
(which are small enough to fit on 1.44mb floppy diskettes)
The learning curve is all but trivial because only the most used functions are implemented: 
  * go directly to a specific verse
  * find verses with specified word(s)

Word/phrase searching is extremely fast, intuitive, and very flexible to find what you are looking for. On most computers, it is running immediately after you _launch_ it, and searching is as fast as you can type.

The small _Starter Kit_ download includes the program, complete Bible, and extensive Help and documentation.

  * mini-tutorial with 7 steps that is 90% of what you need to know to use basic features
  * [animated slideshow](http://www.berbible.org/viewlets/BbEsvMiniTutorial_viewlet.html) of Windows desktop mini-tutorial
  * [animated slideshow](http://berbible.org/viewlets/BbPpcMiniTutorial_viewlet.html) of Pocket-PC version
  * extensive tutorial oriented to less experienced users
  * followup tutorial of New Features for experienced users
  * context sensitive help, 60+ pages of F1-HtmlHelp, FAQA's, e-support, and more

[BerBible-PPC](http://www.berbible.org/download/BerBibleEsvPpcStarterKitSetup.exe) and [BerBible-PALM](http://www.berbible.org/download/BerBibleEsvPalmStarterKitSetup.exe) for pda devices. Searches are fast enough to keep up with stylus taps!

BerBible also works great on obsolete computers that are too slow for software oriented to Bible scholars. It doesnA't assume a high resolution monitor and latest hardware. Its small download size is optimized for people with a slow, unreliable, and/or expensive Internet connection. 

God is pleased when followers of the Lord Jesus Christ have a growing knowlege of His Bible, His Son, and His message of salvation and repentance for a lost and dying world.  
BerBible derives its name from _Berean Bible_, which reflects that the focus is on _sola scriptura_ with no provision for commentaries.  
_... [the noble Bereans] received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. Acts 17:11b (WEB)_
