**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bible Reading Plan Generator allows you to create a customized plan to read
part or all of the Bible over any number of days. The software will then
divide the portion of Scripture you have requested into the required number of
equal portions, so that you are reading the same amount each day. It seeks to
balance the need to divide equally with the need to start and end reading in
sensible places.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
