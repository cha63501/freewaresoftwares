**Publisher's Description**  
  


Bible Reading Plan Generator allows you to create a customized plan to read part or all of the Bible over any number of days. The software will then divide the portion of Scripture you have requested into the required number of equal portions, so that you are reading the same amount each day. It seeks to balance the need to divide equally with the need to start and end reading in sensible places.
