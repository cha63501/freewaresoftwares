**Publisher's Description**  
  

**_EzBible_** is simplified freeware that includes the KJV Bible. It is an adaptation of the Berean Bible study freeware (BerBible) for Windows 9x. The learning curve is all but trivial because only the most used functions are implemented:

  * go directly to a specific verse
  * find verses with specified word(s)

Word/phrase searching is extremely fast, intuitive, and very flexible to find
what you are looking for. On most computers, it is running immediately after
you _launch_ it, and searching is as fast as you can type.

The small _Starter Kit_ download includes the program, complete Bible, and
extensive Help and documentation.

  * mini-tutorial with 7 steps that is 90% of what you need to know to use basic features
  * [animated slideshow](http://www.berbible.org/viewlets/BbEsvMiniTutorial_viewlet.html) of Windows desktop mini-tutorial
  * [animated slideshow](http://berbible.org/viewlets/BbPpcMiniTutorial_viewlet.html) of Pocket-PC version
  * extensive tutorial oriented to less experienced users
  * followup tutorial of New Features for experienced users
  * context sensitive help, 60+ pages of F1-HtmlHelp, FAQA's, e-support, and more

[BerBible-

pda devices. Searches are fast enough to keep up with stylus taps!

EzBible also works great on obsolete computers that are too slow for software
oriented to Bible scholars. It doesnA't assume a high resolution monitor and
latest hardware. Its small download size is optimized for people with a slow,
unreliable, and/or expensive Internet connection.

God is pleased when followers of the Lord Jesus Christ have a growing knowlege
of His Bible, His Son, and His message of salvation and repentance for a lost
and dying world.  
BerBible derives its name from _Berean Bible_, which reflects that the focus
is on _sola scriptura_ with no provision for commentaries.  
_... [the noble Bereans] received the word with all readiness of the mind,
examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. Acts
17:11b (WEB)_
