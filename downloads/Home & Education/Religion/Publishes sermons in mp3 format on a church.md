**Publisher's Description**  
  


Sermons on the Web converts sermons to MP3 format and publishes them on a churchA's own web site. It consists of a web application to host the sermons plus a Windows application to publish them. Listeners can access the sermons via web pages and podcasts, from PCs or mobile devices. 

The Sermons on the Web architecture plugs into any web site that supports PHP and MySQL. It is designed to ease sermon publication by combining these steps into a single operation: encoding and tagging the MP3 file, uploading the MP3 file, and updating the online database.
