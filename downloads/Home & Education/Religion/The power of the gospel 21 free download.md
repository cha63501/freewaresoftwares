**Publisher's Description**  
  

This is a very empowering package! It contains the TruthA's of Grace and
Freedom of the Gospel of Jesus. Yet compiled in an easy to use format which is
ideal for home or group study. What is the Gospel?

Most Christians have a rudimentary understanding of the Gospel. After all, in
order to become a Christian, you need to understand the Gospel, right?

Well, half right. Yes, in order to experience GodA's salvation, you need to
have an understanding of how God saves you, which is a vital part of the
Gospel. But the Gospel is far more than this. The Gospel also describes the
parameters within which God relates to you and works within your life.

Colossians 1:6, The Gospel keeps bringing blessings and is spreading
throughout the world, just as it has among you ever since the day you first
heard about the grace of God and came to know it as it really is. Note how
Paul connects the fact that the Gospel is bearing fruit and growing to the
fact that the early believers understood GodA's grace in all its truth. Like
the love of Christ, the grace of God has awesome length, breadth, height and
depth (see Ephesians 3:18).

In this study, we explore the length, breadth, height and depth of the Gospel
so that we can begin to understand GodA's grace in all its truth.

The result of this revelation is that the Gospel will begin to bear fruit and
grow like we have never experienced before. The Gospel of Jesus- Grace and
Freedom - Ideal for home or group study.
