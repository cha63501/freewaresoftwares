**Publisher's Description**  
  


The purpose of this software program is to aid English instructors and students. English instructors can add as much or as little information to their studentsA' essays as they desire. The instructor can add and delete text, or he or she can simply insert a note that gives the category of the writing problem that the student needs to address. The program totals the problems by category and subcategory. The student can then research the problems with the help of internet keywords and a grammar glossary that is attached to the essay report. 

The English instructor can:

  * Analyze the essay, sentence by sentence.
  * Insert and delete text. (Inserted text is underlined and deleted text is shown with a strikethrough in the report.)
  * Add notes to the sentence. (These notes contain the category and subcategory of the writing problem. The six categories are Content, Grammar, Words, Punctuation, Citations, and Other.)
  * Export an HTML (web page) report for the student. (This report shows the insertions, deletions, and notes for each sentence, contains a summary of the note categories and subcategories, and includes a grammar glossary and internet search terms for the studentA's reference.)
  * View the note category and subcategory totals for a student or for an entire class.
