**Publisher's Description**  
  

For many who have been searching endlessly for a software that could assist
you in attacking those tough GRE, GMAT tests, here comes GuruA's GRE WordList
Memorizer as a final ray of hope.

The GRE Word List Reviewer is a smart tool that incorporates Microsoft
CorporationA's Speech Synthesizer to deliver a quality audio assisted
pronunciation and memorizing mechanism.

From the developer:  
"The origin of this wonderful new tool goes back to the days when I myself was
in the arduous preparation for the GRE. I came upon the idea of developing a
simple tool that could assist me and many others to memorize those tough words
in the BarronA's GRE Word List while, at the same time getting their
pronunciation right. It also helped me a great deal in tackling the TOEFL,
because the audio accompaniment familiarized me with the American accent."

Note: Windows 95/98/Me users should download Microsoft Speech API Libraries to
hear the speech from the program. Download them from **<http://www-
