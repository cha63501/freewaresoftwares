**Publisher's Description**  
  


This software will convert your Singlish text into wijesekara sinhala text. So unlike other conversion utilities, you can simply change the font styles as you want. The software has been designed according to the standard which is used by the Singlish converters. If you are not familiar with the singlish typing, you can understand the Singlish concept by going through the Wijesekara Character Map Mode which is available with the software. 

Also note that the ZSri Lanka Singlish Language Pack does not require any key man utility, because it can handle the problems in Wijesekara font typing.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) (included with installer).
