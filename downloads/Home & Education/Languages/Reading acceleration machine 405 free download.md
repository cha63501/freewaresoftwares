**Publisher's Description**  
  

RAM 4 is a small freeware device for presenting word-groups sequentially at a
pace chosen by the user. It is a tachistoscope ("rapid-viewer") that supports
efficient and rhythmic reading, rehearsal of text-comprehension, and
acceleration in reading speed. It facilitates the repetition that has long
been known to be essential for language-learning. Load a simple text file,
that is, one that Windows Notepad can handle. If it consists of lines
separated by carriage returns, these lines can be displayed in the RAM window
sequentially or randomly, automatically or manually, in looping sections or in
their entirety. Access commands through buttons, menu-items, or speedy
keyboard shortcuts.
