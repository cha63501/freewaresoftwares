**Publisher's Description**  
  

Learn how to read and write in Arabic. You will also be able to learn
vocabulary, and store words that you learned during the day.

5.x now includes the entire Gospel of John in mp3 format. This takes up the
bulk of the program. It allows the user to read along side through the Gospel
of John (in Arabic) with a native speaker. By doing so you can greatly
increase your reading ability.

Also new in this version are new recorded sounds for all the letters and
numbers. After hearing and reviewing them you can then quiz yourself.
