**Publisher's Description**  
  

Lextek Language Identifier is capable of automatically identifying that
language that a document is written in. Supporting over 260 different
languages and encoding modules, the Lextek Language Identifier is capable of
recognizing more languages and more character encodings than any other
language identifier available by a large margin. Furthermore, new languages
and encoding modules are being added all the time.

The Lextek Language Identifier is capable of quickly and efficiently analyzing
which language most closely matches your documentA's text. Not only does the
language identifier tell you which language is most likely the language you
are dealing with but it will also tell you the top three languages that most
closely match.

Use the language identifier to identify what languages e-mail or web pages are
written in or to find out what language those "mysterious documents" that have
been floating around your hard drive is written in. Or in a work related
environment, you can use it to identify what language an e-mail or other
document is written in so it may be forwarded to the correct person for
translation. Now because of the Internet we live in a worldwide community
where literally 100A's of different languages are used with regularity. Let
the Lextek Language Identifier assist you in getting out of the mire of too
many languages.

Free for non-commercial use.

An SDK is also available for developers wishing to add language identification
and classification to their applications. Perfect for language specific web
crawling and indexing or for classifying our routing e-mail to the correct
mailbox or individual.
