**Publisher's Description**  
  


RAM 4 is a small freeware device for presenting word-groups sequentially at a pace chosen by the user. It is a tachistoscope ("rapid-viewer") that supports efficient and rhythmic reading, rehearsal of text-comprehension, and acceleration in reading speed. It facilitates the repetition that has long been known to be essential for language-learning. Load a simple text file, that is, one that Windows Notepad can handle. If it consists of lines separated by carriage returns, these lines can be displayed in the RAM window sequentially or randomly, automatically or manually, in looping sections or in their entirety. Access commands through buttons, menu-items, or speedy keyboard shortcuts.
