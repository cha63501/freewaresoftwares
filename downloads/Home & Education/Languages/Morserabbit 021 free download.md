**Publisher's Description**  
  

MorseRabbit is a small utility designed to help you learn to tap and
understand Morse Code.

MorseRabbit has two training modes, each with 5 levels of difficulty:

  * Normal Mode: You are provided with a morse code sequence (both the visual and audible representation) and are expected to type in the correct word in time.
  * Reverse Mode: You are provided with an alphabetic sequence or a word, and are expected to tap the corresponding morse code.

After you master the 5 training levels, you can continue your morse education
with these lessons:

  * Lesson 6 - Words  
This lesson uses dictionary words instead of random letters.

  * Lessons 7 and above  
In these lessons you practice aspects of morse code that are beyond just
knowing the alphabet. You can practice Prosigns (like the well known SOS),
abbreviations and Q-Codes.
