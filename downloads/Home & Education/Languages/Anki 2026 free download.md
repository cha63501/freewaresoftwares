**Publisher's Description**  
  

Anki is a program designed to help you remember facts (such as words and
phrases in a foreign language) as easily, quickly and efficiently as possible.
To do this, it tracks how well you remember each fact, and uses that
information to optimally schedule review times. With a minimal amount of
effort, you can greatly increase the amount of material you remember, making
study more productive, and more fun.

Anki is based on a theory called spaced repetition. In simple terms, it means
that each time you review some material, you should wait longer than last time
before reviewing it again. This maximizes the time spent studying difficult
material and minimizes the time spent reviewing things you already know. The
concept is simple, but the vast majority of memory trainers and flashcard
programs out there either avoid the concept all together, or implement
inflexible and suboptimal methods that were originally designed for pen and
paper.

AnkiA's primary target is people studying Japanese, and Japanese native
speakers studying English. However, it can be used to remember anything at
all, and there are some users who are studying Chinese and possibly other
languages with it.

**WhatA's New in version 2.0.22:**

  * Fix a regression in the type-answer feature where multiple clozes were not presented in order. 
  * Some tweaks to the SuperMemo importer
