**Publisher's Description**  
  


Did you ever want to take Wikipedia with you while you are offline? Call on WikiTaxi: It is a portable application that delivers the Wikipedia of your choice to wherever you go. 

WikiTaxi enables you to read, search, and browse Wikipedia offline. No Internet connection is needed, all pages are stored in a WikiTaxi database. Because Wikipedia is constantly growing, WikiTaxi uses compression to make sure that the database stays as small as possible. 

WikiTaxi is multilingual, so you can use it for different language Wikipedias (see screenshots). It also works well with the Wiktionary and WikiQuote. You can save multiple Wikis to disk and use all of them with WikiTaxi.

WikiTaxi is up to date. It uses the original Wikipedia database dumps, which are usually updated every few weeks. If you feel that your offline Wikipedia is getting too old, you can download a more recent version or just copy it from a friend. 

**Importing a Database Dump**  
Before you can actually use WikiTaxi, you must [download your Wikipedia](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/) from the Internet and import it into a WikiTaxi database. This is necessary for offline browsing, and it is not difficult at all. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.3.0:**

  * Internationalize names of parser variables and functions. 30 languages are supported, which is most of the Wikipedias with +100000 articles.
