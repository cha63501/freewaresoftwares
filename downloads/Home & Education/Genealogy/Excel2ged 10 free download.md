**Publisher's Description**  
  

This Excel file features the ability to convert Excel data into the genealogy
standard, gedcom format including the ability to specify family relationships.
Gedcom generation is initiated with a push of a VBA coded macro button.

Excel2GED-family distinguishes itself from other Excel2gedcom converters that
do not "draw" the relationships but only add the individuals to the gedcom
file and require family information to be re-added by hand in a family tree
program such a Personal Ancestry File, Legacy Family Tree and Family Tree
Maker. With Excel2GED-family, as long as a parent or spouse is indicated this
interrelationship information can be preserved.

Another feature included is the extensibility of the schema to any field from
the gedcom format and beyond. There are fields for ID, First Name, Middle
Name, Last Name, Birth Date, Birth Place, Wedding Date, Wedding Place, Death
Date, Death Place, Father First Name, Father Last Name, Father ID, Mother
First Name, Mother Last Name, Mother ID, Spouse First Name, Spouse Last Name
and Spouse ID. Full LDS or any other schema is possible.
