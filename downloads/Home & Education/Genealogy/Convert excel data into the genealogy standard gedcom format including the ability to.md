**Publisher's Description**  
  


This Excel file features the ability to convert Excel data into the genealogy standard, gedcom format including the ability to specify family relationships. Gedcom generation is initiated with a push of a VBA coded macro button. 

Excel2GED-family distinguishes itself from other Excel2gedcom converters that do not "draw" the relationships but only add the individuals to the gedcom file and require family information to be re-added by hand in a family tree program such a Personal Ancestry File, Legacy Family Tree and Family Tree Maker. With Excel2GED-family, as long as a parent or spouse is indicated this interrelationship information can be preserved.

Another feature included is the extensibility of the schema to any field from the gedcom format and beyond. There are fields for ID, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Birth Date, Birth Place, Wedding Date, Wedding Place, Death Date, Death Place, Father First Name, Father Last Name, Father ID, Mother First Name, Mother Last Name, Mother ID, Spouse First Name, Spouse Last Name and Spouse ID. Full LDS or any other schema is possible.
