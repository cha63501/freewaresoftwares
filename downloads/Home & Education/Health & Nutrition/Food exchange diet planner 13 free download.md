**Publisher's Description**  
  

Food Exchange Diet Planner is a tool to be used by food professionals and
knowledgeable individuals to create and test diet plans based on the food
exchange scheme. To create a dietary plan using the "food exchange diet
planner" (this program), one needs to follow three steps:

(a) Define the average daily energy requirements of the person that the user
wants to create the diet for. The energy is defined in terms of calories and
can also be suggested by the program based on the personA's age, height,
weight and activity level.

(b) Define the percentages of the three macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein
and fat) that the diet should consist of. The user can either define the three
percentages by himself/herself or choose a predefined set of percentages for
various diet types (e.g. balanced diet, zone diet, mediterranean diet, etc).

(c) Define the preference for the daily number of servings for three food
groups (diary, fruits and vegetables). This piece of information can be
defined to reflect the personal preferences of the person that the user
creates the diet for and can also be chosen from a set of predefined diet
types.

Based on the above information, the program will then calculate the daily
number of servings for the other food groups so that all given constrains are
kept.

The program is easy to use and, additionally, it contains a calorie calculator
which can be used to compute your daily energy needs based on sex, weight,
height and physical activity level.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes 3rd party software which does not have to be installed in order to use the software.
