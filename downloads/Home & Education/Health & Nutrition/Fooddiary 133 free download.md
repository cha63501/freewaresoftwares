**Publisher's Description**  
  

The FoodDiary is a program for tracking daily food consumption and for
measuring how closely that consumption matches your nutrition goals.

Each day, you simply add the foods that you ate to that dayA's food list. The
program will sum up all the nutrients in the foods that you ate and will
display an overall score for the day, and for each nutrient based on your
criteria.

When scoring a food, recipe or a whole day, the program uses a set of criteria
for how much of each nutrient should be consumed. There are pre-built criteria
including the USDA food pyramid recommendations and the "New food pyramid"
detailed in the book "Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy" by Walter Willett. You can
start with these and customize them, or create a whole new set.
