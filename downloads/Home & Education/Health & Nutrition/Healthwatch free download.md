HealthWatch is a free software. HealthWatch can calculate growth percentiles
for infants, children and adolescents (2 to 20 years); blood pressure

Adolescents" from National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to calculate Blood
pressure percentiles for children.

HealthWatch can also evaluate underweight and over weight, identify metabolic
