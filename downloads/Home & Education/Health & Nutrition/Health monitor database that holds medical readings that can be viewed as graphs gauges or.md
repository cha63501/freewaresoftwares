**Publisher's Description**  
  


Health Monitor is a Free Windows database that holds medical readings that can be viewed as graphs, gauges or reports. 

It was initially developed to hold and view my own blood pressure readings but it has now been extended to hold the following:

  * Blood pressure Systolic & Diastolic 
  * Pulse 
  * Weight 
  * Cholesterol 
  * TriglycerideA's 
  * Uric Acid 
  * Blood Sugar & Body Mass Index 

The readings are held by user by date and time so that you can easily switch between the results.

The built in 2D/3D graphs are a great method for viewing your levels that give you an instant insight into how you are doing. Highlighting your highest and lowest readings. You can also use the interactive chart zoom features to drill down into the results.

The reports allow you to generate documents that you take along to your doctor or hospital.

On the summary page are a custom set of gauges which are colour coded Low, Normal, Pre High and High to remind you how well you are doing.
