**Publisher's Description**  
  


This "one-of-a-kind," FREE software is a no-cost/high-tech solution for effortless relaxation! It creates hypnotic pulses that adjust for various CPU speeds, producing a consistent flashrate on oneA's computer monitor, in order to experience the purported relaxing phenomenon of "brainwave entrainment" through "audio-visual-stimulation." This fully-functional program does NOT rely upon "binaural beats," and can even be used as a very effective complement to most audio hypnosis recordings. 

Please note that this software is based upon an outdated shareware program, "Flasher 1.51." My batch download file gives the old software new life, in order for it to function within the modern Windows environment. Although the appearance of the old interface may look awkward, for most people, the program does produce its desired effect, similar to actual Light & Sound Machine goggles.
