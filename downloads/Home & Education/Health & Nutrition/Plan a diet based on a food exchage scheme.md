Food Exchange Diet Planner is a tool to be used by food professionals and knowledgeable individuals to create and test diet plans based on the food exchange scheme. To create a dietary plan using the "food exchange diet planner" (this program), one needs to follow three steps: 

(a) Define the average daily energy requirements of the person that the user wants to create the diet for. The energy is defined in terms of calories and can also be suggested by the program based on the personA's age, height, weight and activity level.

(b) Define the percentages of the three macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein and fat) that the diet should consist of. The user can either define the three percentages by himself/herself or choose a predefined set of percentages for various diet types (e.g. balanced diet, zone diet, mediterranean diet, etc).

(c) Define the preference for the daily number of servings for three food groups (diary, fruits and vegetables). This piece of information can be defined to reflect the personal preferences of the person that the user creates the diet for and can also be chosen from a set of predefined diet types.

Based on the above information, the program will then calculate the daily number of servings for the other food groups so that all given constrains are kept.

The program is easy to use and, additionally, it contains a calorie calculator which can be used to compute your daily energy needs based on sex, weight, height and physical activity level.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes 3rd party software which does not have to be installed in order to use the software.
