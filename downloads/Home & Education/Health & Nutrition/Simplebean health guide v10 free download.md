**Publisher's Description**  
  

The free Simplebean Health Guide quickly calculates your health statistics and
targets. To plan a healthy diet, you get important health information such as
your Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal Energy Expenditure (BEE), personalized daily
calorie requirements and targets, and the target weight for your frame size.

The health guide even breaks down your daily calorie target into carbohydrate,
protein, and fat needs. It is excellent for weight loss or maintenance. An on-
line help system guides you through the process, helping you with all input,
and defining all terms. The help system also gives you access to on-line
articles about nutritional and activity needs of a healthy mind and body.

This is not a trial version. It is a free tool to speed you to your healthy
and happy body.
