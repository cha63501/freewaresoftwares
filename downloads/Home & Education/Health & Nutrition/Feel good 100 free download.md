**Publisher's Description**  
  

Feel Good is a free program that is an attempt to persuade people to feel good
about their own bodies by keeping a score of the good things and not so good
things that they do to themselves.

Honesty is obviously the best policy when using this program. There would be
no point otherwise.

Feel Good runs from Monday to Sunday each week and it is suggested that the
user begins on a Monday. There are three scoring Grids named Healthy Food,
Indulgences and Exercises. You make choices in each grid in the same way.
Click on the Maroon button at the bottom of the Grid and then click into the
appropriate Cell for the Day and the Item chosen.
