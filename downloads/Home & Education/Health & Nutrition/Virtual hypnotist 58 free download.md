**Publisher's Description**  
  

Virtual Hypnotist is a free, open source, interactive hypnosis program, and is
a rewrite of Hypnotizer 2000.

It includes features such as voice recognition, speech synthesis, subliminal
messages, completely customizable scripts (featuring a unique scripting
language), videos, audio, and lots more. Its purpose is to simulate a real
hypnosis session as much as possible.

**Features:**

  * Script maker, for easily editing scripts, and for creating your own, which uses a flexible and unique scripting language. 
  * Binaural brainwave synchronizer, for generating sounds that help induce hypnosis (sync brainwaves), and for providing flashing color bars that visually also sync brainwaves. 
  * Lots of pre-made scripts, from inductions, deepeners, suggestions, etc. 
  * Two subliminal message systems, which add visual subliminal messages in sessions, and even let you display them on your computer screen while you work 
  * Hypnotic visual maker, for designing your own hypnotic effects 
  * Cool presets that get you started instantly 
  * A session logbook that lets you write down successes, notes, ideas, etc. 
  * Fully customizable hypnosis sessions 
  * Complete speech synthesis; choose from a selection of multiple voices, and even use other SAPI4 or SAPI5-compliant speech engines (only partial SAPI5 support is implemented). 
  * Speech recognition that lets you verbally respond to questions and prompts while under hypnosis 
  * Easy and powerful scripting language called ISL used for creating and processing scripts 
  * Animated characters used as virtual AhypnotistsA 
  * Pop-up sessions, where the program can hide in the background and Apop upA at a certain time, and start the hypnotic induction 
  * Support for video files and flash animations, via Windows Media and Macromedia Flash, and even lots of videos/animations included 
  * Speed controls, to slow down and speed up both audio and video
