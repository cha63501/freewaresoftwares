**Publisher's Description**  
  

Windows based program using a SQLite back end to track medicine used to manage
pain. It also tracks the location or form of taking as well as notes you can
enter each time. ItA's designed to be quick and easy to use.

Having to move on to injections, I found it important to have a record of
where I did my injections. It helps me to rotate my injections into different
areas. Plus it also has ways to track pain level, relief time and relief
level. New features will suggest locations, as well as let you temporarily
remove locations from the list. For example if an area bruised.

I have included one of the earlier versions of the source code for review and
learning. My first MFC project in a long time, this program has helped me
solve several problems. I hope it can help you.

Minimal program requires Pentium class machine with 128 megs of ram. Running
MS Windows. Tested on XP, Vista and 2000.
