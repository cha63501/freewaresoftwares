**Publisher's Description**  
  

PhoneRa is a simple tool that does a simple job: it gives you the level of the
Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of your (next) cell phone/mobile phone.  
  
The latest scientific research seems to indicate that radiation from your cell
phone/mobile phone could have a possible negative impact on your health. The
amount of radiation varies per phone but it is generally assumed that the
higher the amount of radiation that is emitted, the higher the amount that is
absorbed in your brain while using your phone.  
  
PhoneRa is making that choice easy for you.
