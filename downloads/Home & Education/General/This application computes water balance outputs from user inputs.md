The water balance is an accounting of the inputs and outputs of water. The water balance of a place, whether it be an agricultural field, watershed, or continent, can be determined by calculating the input, output, and storage changes of water at the EarthA's surface. The major input of water is from precipitation and output is evapotranspiration.
