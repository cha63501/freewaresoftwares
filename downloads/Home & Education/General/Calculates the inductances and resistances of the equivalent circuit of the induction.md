**Publisher's Description**  
  


Induction Motor Data calculates the inductances and resistances of the (well known) equivalent circuit of the induction motor from the "name-plate" parameters. These are the nominal voltage and power, the nominal slip, electrical efficiency, power factor and the ratio of locked rotor current and nominal current. The resistances and inductances can be used in the universal machine 3 - model of the induction motor in ATP and ATPdraw.
