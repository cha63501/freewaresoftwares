**Publisher's Description**  
  

32-Bit Insulter was originally developed when someone asked if a Shakespearean
insult generator was possible to make. I ended up a little out of control and
created this after a few versions of the original idea. ThereA's a system tray
feature that looks the same as the MSN Messenger pop-up window that chucks
insults at you after a user-configurable delay. ItA's had me and my friends in
stiches.
