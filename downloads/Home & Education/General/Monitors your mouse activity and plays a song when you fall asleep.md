**Publisher's Description**  
  


If the mouse button is held down for at least 60 seconds, the FIELD trigger is set and will play the anthem when the button is released. The idea is to catch yourself when you fall asleep - in a dream, but awake. 

The biggest problem with having a WILD (wake-induced lucid dream / trying to stay awake when you fall asleep) is losing consciousness... this will help by playing an audio track to wake up your mind when your body falls asleep. If you can keep from moving then you will be in the "mind awake, body asleep" state, but not necessarily dreaming. If you do this during an afternoon nap or during a WBTB (wake-back-to-bed) exercise after a few hours of sleep will increase the odds drastically.

Requires [Lucid Scribe](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Lucid-Scribe_program_66424.html).
