**Publisher's Description**  
  

SimQuest is an authoring system for creating applications for scientific
discovery learning. SimQuest applications consist of a computer simulation and
integrated (multi-media) learning support (assignments, explanations, model
progression, monitoring tool). Applications now exist in different domains
including electricity, a sewage plant, greenhouse chemistry, and motion.
Teachers (developers) are offered an object oriented environment in which
templates for all elements of the applications are offered. Also teachers have
access to methodological, technical and pedagogical support in the system.
