**Publisher's Description**  
  

DES Algorithm Teacher is an application that you can use to learn the steps of
the DES encryption algorithm from scratch.

To get started, you can just click on the AGeneral AlgorithmA button, which
will display the basic steps of the process, such as AInitial PermutationA,
ALeftA, ARightA, ARoundsA, AKeyA, AInverse InitialA and others.

Moreover, you can click on each section for further details, each one opening
in a new window. For instance, the AInitial PermutationA screen lets you
AStartA the example, and DES Algorithm Teacher will show you gradually how
