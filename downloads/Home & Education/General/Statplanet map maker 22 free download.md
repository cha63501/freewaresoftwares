**Publisher's Description**  
  

StatPlanet Map Maker is a free program for creating highly interactive Flash
maps which can be published online. A stand-alone offline version is also
included.

StatPlanet can be used to create simple thematic maps as well as more advanced
interactive infographics with different graph & chart options, multiple
indicators, and a time slider with the option to animate both the map and the
graph over time. Supported map types are quantitative choropleth maps,
qualititative (descriptive) maps and proportional symbol maps. All map and
interface colors can be customized. The included Excel-based data editor can
be used to automatically import data from virtually any data source. No
knowledge of Flash or programming is required.

Data can be imported automatically, so new interactive maps can be created
within minutes. Maps are completely customizable. Use the included World or
USA maps, design your own maps using the Flash template, or load GIS
shapefiles using StatPlanet Lite.

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows: IntelA(r) PentiumA(r) II 450MHz, AMD AthlonA 600MHz or faster processor (or equivalent) 
  * 128MB of RAM
