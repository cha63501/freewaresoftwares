**Publisher's Description**  
  


BitNami Moodle Stack Native Installer is an easy-to-install distribution of the Moodle application. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run versions of Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin so users can get a Moodle installation up and running in minutes after answering a few questions. Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems are supported. 

Moodle is a Course Management System that is designed using sound pedagogical principles to help educators create effective online learning communities. It can scale from one computer to a 50,000-student university and is used in 175 countries around the world. 

Here are some key features of the BitNami Stacks Native Installers:

**Easy to Install:**  
BitNami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as possible to install open source software. Our installers completely automate the process of installing and configuring all of the software included in each Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

**Independent:**  
BitNami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere with any software already installed on your system.

**Integrated:**  
By the time you click the A'finishA' button on the installer, the whole stack will be integrated, configured and ready to go.

**Relocatable:**  
BitNami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each other.
