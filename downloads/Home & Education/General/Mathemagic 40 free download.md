**Publisher's Description**  
  

Mathemagic is an interactive mathematics game that was designed according to
junior school mathematics syllabi. The seven chapters incorporated include
Multiplication, Division, Fractions, Addition, Subtraction, Money and Number
Skills.

The game treats each chapter as a twenty question exercise. Once students have
been taught a chapter they may apply their knowledge to a practical situation-
stimulating their mind and simultaneously entertaining them. Learners can also
opt for a clue or make a question multiple choice.

Unique cartoons accompany each question and stimulate interest in the
scientifically designed exercises, which get harder as the user progresses. A
collection of visual themes allow learners to change and look and feel of the
interface. Sound adds to the multimedia experience.

The Template Editor can be used to create custom templates- data files on
which exercises are based. The Worksheet Creator facilitates the creation of
customizable mathematics worksheets that can be printed or saved to PDF. User
Accounts allows educators to monitor the performance of each individual
Mathemagic user.
