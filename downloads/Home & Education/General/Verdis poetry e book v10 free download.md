**Publisher's Description**  
  

My Poetry has been influenced by events in my life. Due to drug abuse, my
mother wasnAt able to take care of me while I was growing up. I lived with her
off and on for the first six years of my life. My mother and father were never
married and split when I was five. There was one incident, when I was about
six years old and living with my mom, when she had left me alone for two days.
One of our neighbors found my grandparentsA phone number and called them up to
get me. Events like these inspired some fo my work. I hope you enjoy it.
