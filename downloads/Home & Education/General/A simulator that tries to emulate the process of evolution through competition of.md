**Publisher's Description**  
  


Evolution is a simulator that tries to emulate the process of evolution through competition of resources and random mutations. 100 Creatures compete with each other to stay alive and reproduce where only the strongest survive. 

In this, the first implementation, the goal is to mold the creatures over time by modifying their environment and creating adversity that they must overcome. My long-term vision for the simulator includes a creature creator (lets call it intelligent-designer) where you can pit your creations against naturally selected creatures.

Does not require installation. Simply run the executable file.
