**Publisher's Description**  
  

If the mouse button is held down for at least 60 seconds, the FIELD trigger is
set and will play the anthem when the button is released. The idea is to catch
yourself when you fall asleep - in a dream, but awake.

The biggest problem with having a WILD (wake-induced lucid dream / trying to
stay awake when you fall asleep) is losing consciousness... this will help by
playing an audio track to wake up your mind when your body falls asleep. If
you can keep from moving then you will be in the "mind awake, body asleep"
state, but not necessarily dreaming. If you do this during an afternoon nap or
during a WBTB (wake-back-to-bed) exercise after a few hours of sleep will
increase the odds drastically.

Requires [Lucid Scribe](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Lucid-
