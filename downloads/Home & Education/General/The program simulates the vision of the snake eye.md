Some animals, like for example many species of snakes, have poor eyesight, however their eyes are still best at detecting movement. Snakes have been known to glide past creatures that remain motionless. The program simulates the vision of the snake eye and demonstrates why the snake is unable to see you when you have stopped moving. 

The program requires video capture device (e.g. web camera).
