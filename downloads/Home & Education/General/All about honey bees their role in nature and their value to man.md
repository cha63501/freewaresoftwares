This is probably the only "free educational electronic book" about Honey Bees that is available on the Internet. 

Nicely illustrated with close-up photos. It will tell you all about honey bees, who lives in the beehive and what their duties are, what the hive is made of and looks like inside, what swarming is about, and much more. 

Great learning tool for adults and children. This is a self executable Windows Program. Does "not require" a special reader program. This e-book is new as of June 12, 2003.
