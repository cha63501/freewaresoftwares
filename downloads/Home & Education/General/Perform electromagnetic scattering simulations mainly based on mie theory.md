**Publisher's Description**  
  


Software developed to perform electromagnetic scattering simulations mainly based on classical Mie theory solution. 

ScatLab features: 

  * scattered intensity polar diagrams for coated and uncoated spherical particles 
  * scattered intensity versus theta graphs for coated and uncoated spherical particles 
  * scattered intensity versus radius graphs for homogeneous spherical particles 
  * extinction, scattering and backscattering cross section graphs 
  * angle depolarization graphs 
  * near field imaging for homogeneous spherical particles 
  * Lorentz and Drude dielectric function implementation for refractive index calculation 
  * support for T-matrix method computations 
  * more
