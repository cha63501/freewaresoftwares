**Publisher's Description**  
  

DeadLine is a program useful for solving equations, plotting graphs and
obtaining an in-depth analysis of a function.

Designed especially for students and engineers, the freeware combines graph
plotting with advanced numerical calculus, in a very intuitive approach. Most
equations are supported, including algebraic equations, trigonometric
equations, and exponential equations.

The freeware solves equations graphically and numerically. It displays the
graph of the function and a list of the real roots of the equation. It also
includes the option to evaluate the function and the first two derivatives,
find extrema of the function and integrate numerically. You can even obtain
the first two derivatives. Save the results provided by DeadLine and even
create projects for future use.

While there is no flawless method for solving equations, the program combines
the most successful methods in order to deliver you the right answer.
