**Publisher's Description**  
  


WM3 is a computer program that is used to test the 2D mental rotation. 

In a 2D mental rotation test, the subject is asked to compare two or more 2D objects (or images) and state if they are the same image or if they are mirror images or if they are completely different images. Commonly, the test will have pairs of images each rotated a specific amount of degrees (e.g. 20Adeg, 75Adeg, 140Adeg or 180Adeg). Some pairs will be the same image rotated, some will be different, and some will be mirrored.

Within this program, you can choose from four basic types of experiment (test). With these experiments we examine how quickly and accurately a person differs same (rotated) from different (mirror or completely different) images.

The images (stimuli) are created using a mathematical algorithm so that it is quite difficult to verbalize ("nonverbal" stimuli).
