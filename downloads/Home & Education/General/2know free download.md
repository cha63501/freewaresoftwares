**Publisher's Description**  
  

Many mnemonic systems have been developed to aid in remembering numbers
(credit cards, phone numbers, PINs, passwords, etc). The most prominent of
these assigns a unique consonant sound to each digit, 0-9. These sounds are
then used to form words/phrases that are more easily remembered than the raw
numbers they represent. For example the number 70395 translates into AexampleA
which, along with the translation rules, is far easier to remember than the
number.

The 2Know software automates the translation of numbers to words/phrases using
a 149,000 entry phonetic dictionary. The user simply enters the number to be
translated and a list of candidate words is produced. The user then selects a
word. If additional digits need to be translated, additional candidate words
are presented for selection. This process is continued until the numeric
string is completely translated.
