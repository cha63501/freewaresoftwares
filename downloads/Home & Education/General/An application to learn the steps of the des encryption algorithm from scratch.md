**Publisher's Description**  
  


DES Algorithm Teacher is an application that you can use to learn the steps of the DES encryption algorithm from scratch. 

To get started, you can just click on the AGeneral AlgorithmA button, which will display the basic steps of the process, such as AInitial PermutationA, ALeftA, ARightA, ARoundsA, AKeyA, AInverse InitialA and others.

Moreover, you can click on each section for further details, each one opening in a new window. For instance, the AInitial PermutationA screen lets you AStartA the example, and DES Algorithm Teacher will show you gradually how each character in a written message is associated to a certain number.
