**Publisher's Description**  
  

Morse Machine teaches you code by sending a character and waiting for you to
type what you heard. The program grades your score and adds new characters
when it sees that you are ready. It focuses on the practising characters you
get wrong, so you donA't waste time on those you know. ItA's the fastest way
to learn Morse Code both for beginners and those who want to improve their
receiving speed.

Morse Machine introduces the code in a special order so that you learn the
characters that sound similar and are easily confused together. It sends each
character quickly so you learn the rhythm of each character and donA't fall
into the trap of counting dots and dashes. This is the proven best way to
learn to read Morse code at high speed.

Morse Machine has been designed for radio hams who want to learn Morse code in
order to use it on the air, not just to pass a slow speed Morse test to get
their license. Become proficient at the worldA's first digital communication
mode - the mode used to send those first transatlantic radio signals - and
experience the fun of making worldwide radio contacts even with ultra-simple,
low power transmitters!
