**Publisher's Description**  
  


Markers Assistant provides a single environment where you can create, conduct, deliver, moderate and manage assessment data. 

This enables the marker to concentrate on the marking and not the process. This results in more uniform, consistent assessment conducted within reasonable timeframes, within budget and probably most importantly, reduces the tedious tasks associated with assessment. Your assistant does all these tasks.
