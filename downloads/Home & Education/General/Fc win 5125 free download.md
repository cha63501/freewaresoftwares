**Publisher's Description**  
  

FC-Win (tm) is a front-end program for FortranCalculus (tm). The
FortranCalculus (FC) language is for math modeling, simulation, and
optimization. FC is based on Automatic Differentiation that simplifies
computer code to an absolute minimum; i.e., a mathematical model, constraints,
and the objective (function) definition. Minimizing the amount of code allows
the user to concentrate on the science or engineering problem at hand and not
on the (numerical) process requirements to achieve an optimum solution.

FC-Win has many (60+) example problems with output (see Demos) for viewing and
getting ideas on solving your own problems. These are improved productivity
examples do to using Calculus (level) Problem-Solving. Please share this
Calculus Problem-Solving tool with your friends. Thanks!

Industry problems with solutions over the past twenty plus years have been put
into a textbook to show the power of Calculus (level) Problem-Solving. The
textbook as on our website at fortranCalculus.info/textbook/welcome . The
software architect behind Calculus Compilers is Joe Thames (read about Joe on
our About page).
