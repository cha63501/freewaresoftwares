**Publisher's Description**  
  


Use your gps enabled mobile phone (WM5 / WM6) to store your position to a file and/or the internet. Together with the website www.mapwm.com you can use MapWM to generate Google Earth/Map output and GPX files. 

You may configure the software to store in regular intervals or to perform smart save and store only important track points.

While this Beta has most of the functionality the final version will have, the user interface is not up to our expectations yet.
