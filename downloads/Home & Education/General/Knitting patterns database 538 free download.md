**Publisher's Description**  
  

KPD is a free unique and comprehensive suite of tools designed for knitters &
crocheters. KPD catalogues PDF patterns enabling you to find patterns that
match your knitting requirements and more.

KPD has the functionality of over 20 knitting apps all in one place.

One of the main functions is to add patterns to a database to which KPD
automatically pre-fills fields such as: Gender, Garment Type, Yarn Type, Yarn
Weight/Length, Needles, Gauge, Rating, Notes etc. which you can edit if
required.

Once you have updated a few patterns you will be able to use the Filter option
to list patterns for those matching fields.

For example, if you want to knit a JUMPER for a BABY and you only have 150
grams of 4ply YARN and size 11 NEEDLES then filter to only show the patterns
that match these requirements.

Database pattern records can be viewed by text or in a gallery style.
Selecting a pattern opens a dialog where you can perform actions like View,
Match, Edit pattern etc.

Pattern text can be viewed alongside multiple row counters and markers to
highlight your progress. Pattern text can also be edited to suit your needs.

"My Yarns" enables you to catalogue your own wool stash and optionally will
list yarns that are suitable for a chosen pattern or list patterns that can be
completed using a particular yarn.

KPD comes with a built in bespoke web browser that enables you to download
patterns directly into the app. For patterns not in PDF format you can use the
built in page2pdf function to convert any web page into a PDF pattern.

Also comes with many handy knitting calculators and much more:

  * ounces to grams
