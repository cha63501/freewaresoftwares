Provides a free subscription to Home Computer Magazine, a standard PDF based
monthly magazine from Cranberry Publishing, a UK technology magazine
publisher. No information is sent to the server and no user registration is
required, but a small file is downloaded each logon (c.70 bytes) to check if a
new issue has been published. If it has, it asks if you wish to download it
and if you do, it then stores it for easy access later. Home Computer Magazine
is a free magazine for home PC users with reviews, tutorials, and features
included. By using Issue Manager, you also get a free bonus tutorial each
issue which is only made available to subscribers.
