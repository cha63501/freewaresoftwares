**Publisher's Description**  
  

Gas Mileage Tracker is a program designed to help you understand and track
your gas mileage (MPG) and gasoline usage. You can track your total miles and
gas mileage (MPG), your total highway miles and highway gas mileage, as well
as your city miles and city gas mileage. You will have a record on when you
filled up on gas, how many miles you got in a given tank, how much you spent,
and what your MPG (miles per gallon) was for the tank of gas.

Gas Mileage Tracker allows you to track MPG for any number of cars or other
vehicles. You can get overall gas mileage (MPG) statics or get the gas mileage
statistic for each car separately. There is also a section for notes where you
can record any special data for a specific gasoline or fuel fill up. A search
function will help you find those fuel details at a later date.

Gas Mileage Tracker can print out MPG reports sorted by car or by date on the
fill ups. A blank report can be printed to be used as a form to fill out any
MPG fuel data by hand while you are at the gas station.

We hope you will enjoy Gas Mileage Tracker and you will be able to improve
your fuel economy, MPG, and save money as well as conserve fuel. With the high
price of gasoline and natural gas, fuel economy and conservation is becoming
an important way to control your finances.
