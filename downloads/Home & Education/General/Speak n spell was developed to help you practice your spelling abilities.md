**Publisher's Description**  
  


Speak N Spell was developed to help you practice your spelling abilities. 

When you first launch Speak N Spell, the default word set of over 47,000 words is used. You can open the Word Maintenance window from the menu bar and revise this dictionary (add or delete words), use your own set of words (clear the table and add words), or load a plain text file with words. You can also save the word list to a plain text file. Make such a file one word per line and save the file with a ".txt" suffix.

The four levels of difficulty use different size words:

  1. Easy - Three letter words 
  2. Medium - Four to six letter words 
  3. Hard - Seven to ten letter words 
  4. Hardest - More than ten letter words 

Score is not kept. If you donA't understand the word, you can ask to see the word or just ignore that word and ask for another word.

It is suggested that the System Preferences/Speech/Text to Speech Speaking Rate be set for Slow. Experiment with different voices. Vicki is an good Speaking Voice but you can try the others.

The difficulty level and the Dictionary Word set are saved between sessions.
