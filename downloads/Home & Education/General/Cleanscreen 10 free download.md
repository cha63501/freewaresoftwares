**Publisher's Description**  
  

A very simple, but useful tool, CleanScreen opens a white, maximized window
with no titlebar or borders which covers your entire visible screen. You can
click through eight optional colors - White, Light-Gray, Gray, Black, Red,
Yellow, Green and Blue. . The idea is to create a plain background so you can
see dirt and cleaning fluids on your screen when you are cleaning it.

Ready to run, no installation required.
