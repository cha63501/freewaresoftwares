**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pulse shaping filter program that finds the pole-zero locations of a transfer function, H(s), for a matched filter. H(s) equals a -desired- signal (Yout) divided by a given input signal (Yin). Both Yout and Yin are functions of frequency. 

Group delay may also be calculated to compliment a given data set, thus, providing a flat group delay. Minimizing Intersymbol Interference in a read/write channel for disc drives by shaping and slimming an isolated readback pulse was the main objective for writing this program.

Brubaker; A'Arbitrary equalization with simple LC structuresA'; IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Nov. 1981, pp 3346-3348 or visit fortranCalculus.info/apps/matched-filter.html .Another improved productivity example do to using Calculus (level) Problem-Solving. Industry problems with solutions over the past twenty plus years have been put into a textbook to show the power of Calculus (level) Problem-Solving. The textbook as on our website at fortranCalculus.info/textbook/welcome . The software architect behind Calculus Compilers is Joe Thames (read about Joe on our About page).
