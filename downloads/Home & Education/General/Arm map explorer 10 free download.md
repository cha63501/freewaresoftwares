Arm Map Explorer recreates all the functionalities of Google Maps on your
desktop and adds extras. Map Explorer lets you locate and view any place on
the planet using dynamic interactive maps. These maps are draggable, meaning
no need to click and wait for graphics to reload each time you want to view
adjacent parts of a map. Viewing locations on maps in Map Explorer resembles
the way you use a regular street map.

In addition to the features offered by Google Maps, Map Explorer allows you to
view a map with a coordinate grid on it, get precise coordinates of any
location on the map and move to a location based on specified coordinates.
With the help of the object tree, you can instantly locate and view capitals
of states, large cities, world landmarks, monuments, international airports
and other locations. You can save a map as a file or print it to use on a
trip. Map Explorer can help you study geography, both physical and economic.
The program will display a satellite view of any location that you can zoom in
and out and pan in any direction.
