**Publisher's Description**  
  


Displays lines and surfaces defined algebraically in 3D space in many forms, including z=f(x,y), cylindrical polar coordinates, and parametric definitions with one (giving a line) and two (surface) parameters. View controls move the viewpoint through 3D space, using keyboard and mouse. 

There are options to display a surface, a mesh or a combination. The number of A'stepsA' on each edge (level of detail) can be controlled. The defining expressions include a very wide range of forms : polynomials, trig, hyperbolic exponential and logarithmic, rational expressions and series sums and products.
