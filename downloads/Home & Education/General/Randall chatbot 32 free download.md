**Publisher's Description**  
  

Randall is a chatbot: a program to imitate human language. It learns by
mimicking what is said to it and will often put words together into original,
though fractured and silly, sentences. "Randall" is an acronym that stands for
"Recursively Analyse Node Databases As Linked Lists." Randall Chatbot won
Silver in the Learning Bot category of the 2006 [Chatterbox
Challenge](http://www.chatterboxchallenge.com/).

**Tips:**

  * While Randall treats most .rcb files as documents, Randall.rcb is a quasi-program file and will be deleted if you uninstall the program. 
  * The chatbot file supplied is quite large, so the program will take a while before appearing. 
  * To get a blank chatbot file and use the botA's learning capabilities, click the New Document button. 

Requires: [Microsoft
Agent](http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/downloads/user.asp)  
You may have to download Msagent, a character, and the speech APIs separately.
Windows 2000 or XP users already have Microsoft Agent.
