**Publisher's Description**  
  

GPSMaster is gps mapping software that runs under Windows on a PC and is able
to communicate (serial or USB) with any Garmin GPS. You can download all the
desired data from your GPS, edit it, save it, view it, print it, upload it.
When you use your GPS regularly GPSMaster is a must have!

GPSMaster is ideal for pilots, sailors, cyclists, hikers, basically anyone who
enjoys outdoor activities. When you go on holiday to a place youA've never
been before, just get yourself a map of the particular area, scan it, load it
into GPSMaster, calibrate it and youA're ready to go. You can create
waypoints, routes and tracks based on your scanned map and send them to your
GPS.
