A very simple, but useful tool, CleanScreen opens a white, maximized window with no titlebar or borders which covers your entire visible screen. You can click through eight optional colors - White, Light-Gray, Gray, Black, Red, Yellow, Green and Blue. . The idea is to create a plain background so you can see dirt and cleaning fluids on your screen when you are cleaning it. 

Ready to run, no installation required.
