**Publisher's Description**  
  

Follow Muggins, Jim and Nan in their comical adventures! Nessy Tales are
structured with a limited vocabulary, while retaining a vivid storyline. The
careful choice of graded words provides vital reading practice at the
beginning stages of reading but the story content is suitable for a slightly
older age group who may have fallen behind. These interactive books can act as
a vital bridge between listening and reading. The animations provide visual
entertainment and motivation.

Reading ability 5-7 years (key stage 1), age appropriate content up to 12
years (key stage 2). Nessy Tales are particularly suitable for reluctant
readers or those with special educational needs. Dyslexic children often have
an aversion to books. Download the first book for free! Additional books
available for a great low price.
