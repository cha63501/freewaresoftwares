**Publisher's Description**  
  

Displays graphs of algebraic functions in a variety of forms. These include
polar and cartesian co-ordinates, parametric and intrinsic functions. A wide
range of functions are built-in, from simple trig and hyperbolic functions to
things such as the ceil and gamma functions. On-screen HTML help is bulit-in.

Functions can be defined such as f(x)= 1 + x These can be of unlimited
complexity, and can refer to other functions such as g(x) = f(x) + 2*x Other
variables can be set up, so we can define for example f(x) = m*x + c and then
vary m and c and see the change to the graph.

It will also handle differentiation, integration, sums and products of series.
It will deal with Maclaurin and Fourier series, such as a Fourier
approximation to a square wave. The graph limits can be altered in various
ways - zoom in and out, center, left right up down and direct entry. Mouse
wheel does zoom in and out. A chord can be displayed on a function, with the
slope of the chord calculated and displayed.
