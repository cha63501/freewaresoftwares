**Publisher's Description**  
  

This easy-to-use flash card program helps you quickly and painlessly learn the
US Presidents.  
  
ItA's best feature is the delayed time feature. You can set the program to ask
you a question every five minutes. This allows you to do other things while
learning.  
  
I know this system works because I made it for myself and used it to learn and
memorize the US Presidents. I hope you enjoy!
