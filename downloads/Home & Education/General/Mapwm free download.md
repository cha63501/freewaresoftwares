**Publisher's Description**  
  

Use your gps enabled mobile phone (WM5 / WM6) to store your position to a file
and/or the internet. Together with the website www.mapwm.com you can use MapWM
to generate Google Earth/Map output and GPX files.

You may configure the software to store in regular intervals or to perform
smart save and store only important track points.

While this Beta has most of the functionality the final version will have, the
user interface is not up to our expectations yet.
