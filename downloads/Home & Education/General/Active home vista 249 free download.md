**Publisher's Description**  
  

Active Home Vista is the A'control centerA' of your home automation system.
You can control all your devices, program the X10 interface and receive
updates from the X10 interface to see whatA's going on X10-wise.

Dusk & dawn timers are supported. The limited EEPROM of the interface is used
in an efficient way to store as many timers & macros as possible. Also DST
support is present. For a number of X10 devices a program wizard is available.

The program supports text to speech & speech recognition. Besides that itA's
possible to use the program within your own scripts using a simple command
line interface. With version 2.0.0 also a web server is integrated, so your
X10 devices can be controlled from virtually everywhere.

Since 2.3.0 the support for extended commands (Type 0 and Type 3) has been
enhanced. Also supports now the variable ramp of dimming that is part of Type
3 command 1.

Last but not least the program can serve as server for multiple network
clients. It also supports clients that run on Android, so you can control and
monitor your devices also from your phone, tablet or Google TV. The Android
app can be downloaded from Google Play. Since January 2014 also a BlackBerry
app is available. This app can be downloaded from the BlackBerry App World.

YouA'll need a computer, a free serial port (or USB) and a X10 interface to do
anything useful.

The following interfaces are supported:

  * CM10A / IBM Home director 16 (beta, downloading macros / timers is not supported) 
  * CM11A (CM12) 
  * CM15A (downloading macros / timers is not supported) 
  * CM17A 
  * CM19A (select CM15A as interface) 
  * CP10 (beta) 
  * Universal Devices ISY-99 (select CM15A as interface) 
  * XTB-232 (select CM11A as interface and uncheck A'Automatically adjust time of interfaceA') 

In order to use it with the CM15A interface, the ActiveHome Pro SDK is needed
(if you donA't have the ActiveHome Pro software installed). This SDK can be
downloaded [here](http://www.activehomepro.com/sdk/ahsdk_install.exe).
