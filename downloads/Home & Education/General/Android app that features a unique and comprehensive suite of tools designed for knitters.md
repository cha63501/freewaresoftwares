**Publisher's Description**  
  


KPD is a free unique and comprehensive suite of tools designed for knitters & crocheters. KPD catalogues PDF patterns enabling you to find patterns that match your knitting requirements and more. 

KPD has the functionality of over 20 knitting apps all in one place.

One of the main functions is to add patterns to a database to which KPD automatically pre-fills fields such as: Gender, Garment Type, Yarn Type, Yarn Weight/Length, Needles, Gauge, Rating, Notes etc. which you can edit if required.

Once you have updated a few patterns you will be able to use the Filter option to list patterns for those matching fields.

For example, if you want to knit a JUMPER for a BABY and you only have 150 grams of 4ply YARN and size 11 NEEDLES then filter to only show the patterns that match these requirements.

Database pattern records can be viewed by text or in a gallery style. Selecting a pattern opens a dialog where you can perform actions like View, Match, Edit pattern etc.

Pattern text can be viewed alongside multiple row counters and markers to highlight your progress. Pattern text can also be edited to suit your needs.

"My Yarns" enables you to catalogue your own wool stash and optionally will list yarns that are suitable for a chosen pattern or list patterns that can be completed using a particular yarn.

KPD comes with a built in bespoke web browser that enables you to download patterns directly into the app. For patterns not in PDF format you can use the built in page2pdf function to convert any web page into a PDF pattern.

Also comes with many handy knitting calculators and much more:

  * ounces to grams 
  * needles to wool size 
  * sleeve reduction 
  * row increase/decrease calculator 
  * 2 sock pattern generators 
  * yarn substitutions, including feet, yards, meters, ounces and grams
