**Publisher's Description**  
  


Rational Typist is a software that enables your hands to memorize keyboard layout and speeds up your touch-typing skills. 

Rational Typist is not a typical typing program, and it is not designed to teach the very first steps e.g. what fingers should type what letters (it does not even have visual keyboard layout being constantly present at its UI).

Rational Typist is the program designed to boost your touch typing skills, although, in fact, it can be used by those who have never tried typing with 10 fingers: making your hands to learn own letters is very easy with Rational Typist and soon you donA't even need visual keyboard layout.

Its central feature is to help your left and right hands to memorize own range of letters i.e. the letters that are typed whether by left or rights fingers. Therefore Rational Typist introduces left-hand and right-hand words, and also left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left words (R2L).
