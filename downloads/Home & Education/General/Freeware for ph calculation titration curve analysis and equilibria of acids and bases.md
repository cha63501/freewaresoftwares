**Publisher's Description**  
  


Powerful all-in-one freeware for acid-base equilibria learning and practicing, in high school, college or research laboratory, by: 

  * calculating the pH of any aqueous solution of acids and bases (strong, weak or polyprotic), salts and complex mixtures; 
  * generating graphics of the dissociated and undissociated fractions of acids and bases as a function of pH (distribution diagrams); 
  * simulating complete acid-base titration curves (pH versus volume of titrant); 
  * analyzing potentiometric titration curves by graphical methods with interpolation and smoothing or by nonlinear regression, to determine concentrations and pKas of real samples, from vinegar to acid rain. 
The single-file Excel workbook comprises seven spreadsheets with graphics, instructions, examples, database and visual basic macros, that are uninstalled while closing the file (former versions, since 1992, run in MS-DOS without Excel). 

Requires Excel or any Spreadsheet that supports Excel files.
