**Publisher's Description**  
  

SuperMemo makes it possible for you to learn fast and retain memories for
years.

It helps you collect, read and process important knowledge in the process
called **[incremental
reading](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading)** and remember it
indefinitely with the help of so-called **spaced repetition**.

SuperMemo 2004 is SuperMemoA's twelfth release since 1987. It has been
released as freeware in April 2010.
