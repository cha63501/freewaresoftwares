**Publisher's Description**  
  


A new 2010 freeware Oracle, Tarot and Divinity Software for PC and Windows 7. Edinamarry brings to you an open Tarot Scribe Kit by which you can create your own Tarot Deck, and you can write your own readings and afterwards share your Tarot Deck and your Tarot Database on Internet with all other users of Edinamarry. You can find answers to your questions with Tarot through Divinity, and Edinamarry is just built for this purpose. 

Edinamarry comes with a default factory Database already filled with the content to support Edinamarry Tarot tools. I have prepared the Tarot readings with brief descriptions and with brief essays to give you the full explaination of each and every Tarot Card which you choose from the Deck. I am sure that you would be satisfied with the brief knowledgeable content of Edinamarry. You can print the readings, even a bunch of readings, or an entire Deck. 

There is a built-in integrated specialized Writepad in Edinamarry in which you can type your thoughts, and you can save your typed content which includes readings on chance, into Windows Write Format files .rtf. Tarot Card Pictures are also printable. 

Similarly, there are automatic Software Update and Database Update Tools which are used to automatically Update Edinamarry to the latest Version. There is also an Email Tool by which you can easily send me emails, comments, suggestions, questions, or any other message. You can view all Tarot Cards and print their short meanings as well. 

Most importantly I would like to gladly inform you about a new feature in Edinamarry which is the Peer to Peer Tarot Deck Exchange Tool in-built into Edinamarry Software. By using this Tool you can connect to Tarot Deck Exchange Network and share your Tarot Decks with all other Connected Users, and there you can exchange, upload, download Tarot Decks from whereever you are in the world. That is called Edinamarry P2P Network. Prior to downloading a Tarot Deck, you can view a Demo Card fetched from remote Peer, etc.
