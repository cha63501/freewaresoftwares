**Publisher's Description**  
  


WM2 is a computer program for testing visual working memory capacity, primarily those whose starting base rests in the P-system (parvocellular, or midget or "what" pathway) functionality. 

The application can generate four different test (research or experiment) associated with Short-term memory and Match-to-Sample Task (and the related Delayed Match-To-Sample Task).

Test1 and Test3 are used in research of perceptual speed (perceptive speed).

Test2 and Test4 (delayed response task or delayed-response task) are used in neuroscientific experiments for testing working memory humans and primates, since these tests are sensitive to brain injury.

The images (stimuli) are created using a mathematical algorithm so that it is quite difficult to verbalize ("nonverbal" stimuli).
