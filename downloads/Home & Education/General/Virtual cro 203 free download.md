**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Virtual C.R.O. program simulates a Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (C.R.O.). It
has been designed for engineering students to study various waveforms using a
C.R.O.-like interface, since the actual C.R.O. and the circuits they are
studying may not always be available to them due to limited laboratory access.

Please note that this is merely a software simulation, and the waveforms that
the program displays are software-generated (using programmed mathematical
expressions).

This program could be used as a simple interface to observe any waveform
(typically the theoretical output of some circuit), to study various C.R.O.
effects and experiments, or even to learn how to use a C.R.O.

The virtual C.R.O. has 5 input channels. What A'signalsA' are A'connectedA' to
each channel is defined by the A'experimentA' you select, and its parameters.
The program includes a set of common experiments; you can add your own by
modifying the source code and re-compiling the program.
