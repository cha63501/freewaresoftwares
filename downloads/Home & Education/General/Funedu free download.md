**Publisher's Description**  
  

FunEDU is a combination of articles and craft-style projects designed to give
children (ages 7 to 12) a scense that computers are more than just for playing
games and chatting online. FunEDU shows how you can acquire knowledge from
your computer and apply it in life away from the PC. ItA's divided into 3
sections:

  1. Fun With History - a series of short articles on subjects ranging from the Abacus to Spiders, Medieval Games, and even some of AmericaA's greatest inventors, such as Edison and Ben Franklin. All of these articles were written with the child user in mind, and are pleasingly illustrated. It should be noted that these articles are not all-encompassing over the subjects they cover, but rather designed to create interest in the various history, science and math fields within the child. With the idea that this interest will encourage the child to seek more advanced knowledge on the topics for themselves. 
  2. Fun Facts - a treasure of trivia, again intended to fuel the childA's natural thirst for knowledge. 
  3. Super Fun Projects - from homemade (easy clean-up) finger paint to an erupting volcano, the 25 projects are meant to show children how to take what they learn with the computer away from it, and apply the knowledge in real life situations. Plus, theyA're loads of fun for the whole family to participate in. 

SPECIAL NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER: "While we went to great lengths to insure
that all of the projects are as fun, easy and SAFE as possible for children,
many do involve the use of scissors and/or other common household items and
chemicals, so we strongly suggest adult supervision whenever a child decides
to build the projects."
