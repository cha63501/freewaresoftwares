**Publisher's Description**  
  

Evolution is a simulator that tries to emulate the process of evolution
through competition of resources and random mutations. 100 Creatures compete
with each other to stay alive and reproduce where only the strongest survive.

In this, the first implementation, the goal is to mold the creatures over time
by modifying their environment and creating adversity that they must overcome.
My long-term vision for the simulator includes a creature creator (lets call
it intelligent-designer) where you can pit your creations against naturally
selected creatures.

Does not require installation. Simply run the executable file.
