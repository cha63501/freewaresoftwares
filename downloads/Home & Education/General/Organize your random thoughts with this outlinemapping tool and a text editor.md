**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Literary Machine is a revolutionary relational database and composition tool that manages any kind of information, even the random thoughts and bits of information you get, and forget, throughout the day. LMA's unique system unharnesses you (and your thinking) from the rigid framework of conventional databases. The fruit of this breakthrough is a new species of program. For, LM is much more than a database: it is also a creativity tool. It manages ideas, not just information, as a brainstorming and mind-mapping application. 

Similarly, LMA's unique composition tools are the first of their kind. Before firing up your conventional word processor, Web page creation software, or presentation program, assemble your materials into a coherent and elegantly organized composition with the Literary Machine. Watch your productivity soar. And, when you see your highly polished output, youA'll know why we call this program The Literary Machine.
