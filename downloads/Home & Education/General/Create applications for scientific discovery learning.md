SimQuest is an authoring system for creating applications for scientific discovery learning. SimQuest applications consist of a computer simulation and integrated (multi-media) learning support (assignments, explanations, model progression, monitoring tool). Applications now exist in different domains including electricity, a sewage plant, greenhouse chemistry, and motion. Teachers (developers) are offered an object oriented environment in which templates for all elements of the applications are offered. Also teachers have access to methodological, technical and pedagogical support in the system.
