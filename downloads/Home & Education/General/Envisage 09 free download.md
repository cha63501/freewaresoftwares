**Publisher's Description**  
  

Envisage is a 2D plotting application. Envisage specializes in the graphing of
mathematical functions- be it linear, quadratic, circular, parabolic,
hyperbolic, trigonometric, ecliptic, exponential or logarithmic. Envisage also
supports the insertion of markers, legends and grids into plots, and includes
intricate graph formatting features such as background and margin alteration.

Everything in a plot can be labeled- from the graph itself to individual axes,
markers and curves. Envisage supports multiple level hierarchical zooming in
and out, and automatically adjusts graph axes and scales relative to a userA's
desired zoom level.

In addition to the plotting of mathematical functions and data series,
Envisage comes with tools that aid work in biplaner Cartesian geometry- this
includes calculators for the section formula, midpoint formula, distance
formula, point of interception of straight lines and roots of quadratic
equations.
