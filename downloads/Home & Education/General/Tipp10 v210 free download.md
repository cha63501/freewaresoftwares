TIPP10 is a free touch typing tutor for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. The
ingenious thing about the software is its intelligence feature. Characters
that are mistyped are repeated more frequently. Beginners will find their way
around right away so they can start practicing without a hitch.

Useful support functions and an extensive progress tracker, topical lessons
and the ability to create your own practice lessons make learning to type
easy.
