**Publisher's Description**  
  

TQA's FunPlot is a function plotting application that plots any user-typed 1-D
and 2-D functions.

**Features:**

  * The built-in function parser accepts any function typed in C-style. It recognizes 13 operators, 44 function names, 2 constants plus unlimited number of independent variables. Please click here for a complete list. 
  * Exception handling prevents floating-point errors (such as divided-by-zero, math domain error, overflow/underflow, etc.) from crashing the program. 
  * The built-in function parser is able to calculate symbolically the derivative (or partial derivative) of the user-typed function (if itA's differentiable). 
  * The built-in function parser does simplification to the user-typed function. 
  * The plots are fully interactive. They can be zoomed, moved, or rotated (for 3-D only). 
  * The plots can be copied, saved or printed. The user may choose to copy or save the plots as bitmap, enhanced metafile, or data points in text format. The enhanced metafile format guarantees no loss of resolution when zoomed or printed. 3-D plots can also be saved in AutoCAD DXF format. 
  * Four different types of 3-D plots are available: wire frame, color-coded wire frame with hidden line removal (with or without interpolation), color-filled facets (with or without interpolation), shaded facets (with or without interpolation). 
  * 3-D plots may have optional perspective. 
  * The user may change plot properties including the colo
