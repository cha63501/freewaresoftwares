**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program will create Electronic Flash Cards. To be used just like regular (old school) manual flash cards. My daughter still uses flash cards to study for tests in college. Many other students do also. It is still the best way to drill things into your head. Not only does it force you to write things down, but the repetitions re-enforce the memory. Answering the questions in a continuously random order also helps. 

If you can get your friends to also use this program you can share flash card files with each other.

**Features:**

  * Unlimited test sets. 
  * Unlimited questions per set. 
  * Answer questions in order or in a random fashion. 
  * Easy question and answer data entry. 
  * Integrated help instructions. 
  * The window scales all items on the page. 
When you make the window bigger all buttons and text scale up proportionally, not just more white space. This makes it easier to use if on touch screen computers.
