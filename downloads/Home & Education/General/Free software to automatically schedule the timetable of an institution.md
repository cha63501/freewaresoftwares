  * Localized to English, French, Catalan, Romanian, Malay, Polish, Turkish, Dutch, German, Hungarian and Macedonian (maybe incompletely) 
  * Fully automatic generation algorithm, allowing also semi-automatic or manual allocation 
  * Platform independent implementation, allowing running on GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac and any system that Qt supports 
  * Powerful flexible modular xml format for the input file, allowing editing with an xml editor or by hand (besides FET) 
  * Possibility to view the currently generated timetable without stopping the ongoing simulation 
  * The resulted timetables are exported into xml and html formats 
  * Very flexible students (pupils) structure, in years, groups and subgroups. FET allows overlapping years and groups and non-overlapping subgroups 
  * Possibility to consider a weight (percentage) for each constraint

  * Adjustable duration for each activity (each activity can have duration of 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours or more) 
  * Possibility of adding multiple teachers and students sets for each activity. That is, each activity can have specified at most 400 students subgroups (sets) and 100 teachers 
  * Maximum number of time constraints: 3000 
  * Maximum number of space constraints: 3000 
  * A large and flexible palette of time constraints 
  * A large and flexible palette of space constraints 

**WhatA's New in version 5.21.2:**
