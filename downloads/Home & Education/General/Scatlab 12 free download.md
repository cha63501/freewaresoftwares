**Publisher's Description**  
  

Software developed to perform electromagnetic scattering simulations mainly
based on classical Mie theory solution.

ScatLab features:

  * scattered intensity polar diagrams for coated and uncoated spherical particles 
  * scattered intensity versus theta graphs for coated and uncoated spherical particles 
  * scattered intensity versus radius graphs for homogeneous spherical particles 
  * extinction, scattering and backscattering cross section graphs 
  * angle depolarization graphs 
  * near field imaging for homogeneous spherical particles 
  * Lorentz and Drude dielectric function implementation for refractive index calculation 
  * support for T-matrix method computations 
  * more
