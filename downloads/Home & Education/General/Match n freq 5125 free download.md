**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pulse shaping filter program that finds the pole-zero locations of a transfer
function, H(s), for a matched filter. H(s) equals a -desired- signal (Yout)
divided by a given input signal (Yin). Both Yout and Yin are functions of
frequency.

Group delay may also be calculated to compliment a given data set, thus,
providing a flat group delay. Minimizing Intersymbol Interference in a
read/write channel for disc drives by shaping and slimming an isolated
readback pulse was the main objective for writing this program.

improved productivity example do to using Calculus (level) Problem-Solving.
Industry problems with solutions over the past twenty plus years have been put
into a textbook to show the power of Calculus (level) Problem-Solving. The
textbook as on our website at fortranCalculus.info/textbook/welcome . The
software architect behind Calculus Compilers is Joe Thames (read about Joe on
our About page).
