**Publisher's Description**  
  


Provides a free subscription to Home Computer Magazine, a standard PDF based monthly magazine from Cranberry Publishing, a UK technology magazine publisher. No information is sent to the server and no user registration is required, but a small file is downloaded each logon (c.70 bytes) to check if a new issue has been published. If it has, it asks if you wish to download it and if you do, it then stores it for easy access later. Home Computer Magazine is a free magazine for home PC users with reviews, tutorials, and features included. By using Issue Manager, you also get a free bonus tutorial each issue which is only made available to subscribers.
