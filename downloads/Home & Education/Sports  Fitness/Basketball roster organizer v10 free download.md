The Roster Assistant can be used to make sure each basketball player gets a
turn at each position, to make sure that each player gets their fair share of
playing time, and/or to track which rosters are the most successful.

teams as well as any number of basketball games.

For each game played the coach can track the player roster used including
which players played which basketball positions during each quarter, which

coach to plan the basketball position and organize substitutes for each
quarter prior to the game. Then the coach announces the players and positions

guard.
