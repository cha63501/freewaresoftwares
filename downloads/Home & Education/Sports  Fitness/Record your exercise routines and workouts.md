**Publisher's Description**  
  


My Exercise Diary is a free program that helps you record your exercise sessions with sections for anaerobic, aerobic and jogging. Once you have entered several sessions the program will create charts and reports which indicate your performance trends. 

My Exercise Diary also includes a Dashboard which summarises your fitness in the different exercise categories. The program also estimates your ability to complete a Marathon and the time it will take you based on national averages.

The program is totally free and I hope it proves as useful to you as it did to me. It is very simple to use, it takes only minutes to get going but the reports it produces are very informative and helpful.
