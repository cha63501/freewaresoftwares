Football Roster Assistant is a free software program designed for football
coaches of kidA's football teams like Pee Wee football, Pop Warner, or city
leagues.

The main goal of the program is to allow the coach to plan rosters and roster
changes before the game. This way the coach can make sure that each football
player gets a turn at each position and gets a fair amount of playing time. It
also enables the coach to track which rosters, substitution rotations, and key
player positions play best over time.

With Football Roster Assistant the coach can track any number of football
games as well as any number of teams using different team files. For each game
played the Football Assistant tracks which players played which football
positions during each quarter, which players were substitutes, wins, losses,
the opponent, the score, and the date of the game. A coach can plan the roster
the day before the game or copy a previously successful roster. The coach then
prints the roster prior to the game and reads off player positions as the
players enter the field. Both defensive and offensive football rosters are
tracked. No worries about who got the most playing time or who never got to
play tailback or quarterback.

The player roster is constantly updated by the program, so coaches donA't have
to re-enter the players names every time. Once a players name is entered, that
footballer is now part of the roster and will appear on all the pull-down
menus. Make game day run smoothly with this easy to use program.
