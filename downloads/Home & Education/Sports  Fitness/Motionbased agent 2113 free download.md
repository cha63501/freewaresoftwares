**Publisher's Description**  
  

MotionBased Agent translates GPS and heart rate data from the latest Garmin
devices (Forerunner 201 and 301, Foretrex, eTrex, Geko, and GPSMAP) into
performance analysis and mapping that is viewed on the Internet. After the
MotionBased Agent extracts data from a GPS device, it automatically sends that
information, pending an Internet connection, to the MotionBased Web site where
users store, track, analyze, map, and share their activities online.
MotionBased interprets GPS and data with complex algorithms to calculate time,
distance, speed, and elevation metrics. To make sense of this data,
MotionBased displays this information through charts, illustrations, reports,
and maps.

Users can choose from a variety of maps to visualize their activity. Moreover,
users can replay the experience using standard media controls as they watch
themselves move along the mapped route. Version 2.1.1.3 streamlines the upload
process making sure only the new activities are sent to the inbox.
