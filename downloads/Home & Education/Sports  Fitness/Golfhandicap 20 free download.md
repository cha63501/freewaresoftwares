**Publisher's Description**  
  

GolfHandicap is a tool you can use to compute your USGA Handicap. It is
friendly for both 18 hole rounds and 9 hole rounds. It features an easy
graphical interface, and a nice report that shows your handicap differential
for each round played, chronological handicap, and the rounds that figured
into your computed handicap. Version 2.0 is more robust to prevent erroneous
data to be entered. Results are not approved for USGA tournament play.
