Soccer Roster Organizer is a freeware program for soccer coaches of kidA's soccer traveling teams or city leagues. 

By setting up team rosters and planning roster changes before the game, the coach can accomplish a number of items including allowing for each soccer player to get a turn at each position and allotting fair playing time between players. 

Soccer Assistant allows coaches to track substitution rotations, starting line-ups, and what key roster mixes are the most competitive. Soccer Roster Assistant can track any number of soccer games as well as any number of teams using different team files. For each game throughout the soccer season, Soccer Assistant allows the coach to track the soccer positions played by each player during each period, substitutes, wins, losses, the game score, the date, and the opponent. A soccer coach can set up the roster and even send it out prior to the game. 

Coach can also copy an earlier used competitive roster and then make tweaks or changes based on player injuries or attendance. The coach can then print off the roster prior to the game and give assignments to players as they run onto the field. No more confusion about who didnA't get enough playing time or who never got to play center forward or goalkeeper. 

The player roster is dynamically updated by the software as players are entered. This way coaches wonA't have to re-enter the names for every period and game. Once a soccer players name is entered, that player becomes part of the roster and will appear on all the pull-down menus as well as the roster list on the main screen. Bring your coaching to a new level and help game day run smoothly with this free and easy to use game organizer.
