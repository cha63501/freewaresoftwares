Soccer Roster Organizer is a freeware program for soccer coaches of kidA's
soccer traveling teams or city leagues.

By setting up team rosters and planning roster changes before the game, the
coach can accomplish a number of items including allowing for each soccer
player to get a turn at each position and allotting fair playing time between
players.

Soccer Assistant allows coaches to track substitution rotations, starting
line-ups, and what key roster mixes are the most competitive. Soccer Roster
Assistant can track any number of soccer games as well as any number of teams
using different team files. For each game throughout the soccer season, Soccer
Assistant allows the coach to track the soccer positions played by each player
during each period, substitutes, wins, losses, the game score, the date, and
the opponent. A soccer coach can set up the roster and even send it out prior
to the game.

Coach can also copy an earlier used competitive roster and then make tweaks or
changes based on player injuries or attendance. The coach can then print off
the roster prior to the game and give assignments to players as they run onto
the field. No more confusion about who didnA't get enough playing time or who
never got to play center forward or goalkeeper.

The player roster is dynamically updated by the software as players are
entered. This way coaches wonA't have to re-enter the names for every period
and game. Once a soccer players name is entered, that player becomes part of
the roster and will appear on all the pull-down menus as well as the roster
list on the main screen. Bring your coaching to a new level and help game day
run smoothly with this free and easy to use game organizer.
