Baseball Roster Assistant is a free software program that enables baseball
coaches to organize and track baseball teamA's roster changes. Whether the
coach needs to make sure that each baseball team player gets their turn at
each position or whether they want to track which rosters garner the team the
most wins, this baseball software program can help.

Baseball Roster Assistant allows you to track any number of baseball teams
under different team files and any number of baseball games. Under each game
you can track the roster used, which players played which baseball positions
during each inning, opponent, win/loss, date the game was played, and score.

You can also print out the team roster prior to the game. This allows coaches
to set up each baseball position for each inning ahead of time. Then they read
off the positions as players run out onto the baseball field. No worries about
who got to pitch the most or who never got to play first base or catcher. Now
you have the roster printed out ahead of time and you also have a record.

Join the fun and try out this great baseball team organizer. Help files are
included in the Baseball Roster Assistant software program, as well.
