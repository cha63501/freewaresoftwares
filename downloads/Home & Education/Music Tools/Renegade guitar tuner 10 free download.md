**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Renegade Guitar Tuner was going to be a new feature in Guitar and Drum
Trainer 2, but since itA's only in beta, IA've decided to release it on its
own. The Renegade Guitar Tuner is free.

This program is to help you tune your guitar. Just plug-in your guitar to your
mic jack and turn up your guitarA's volume. Helpful instructions can be found
inside the software.

Click the "Tune me baby~!" button to start it, and then start plucking
strings. YouA'll have to tune to numbers (e.g. Low E is 82.41 Hz) for the time
being (I said it was beta...). All the notes and their values are readily
available in the program. Just scroll down in the text box in the program to
see them.

The accuracy is good enough, but not perfect. (Hey... IA'm honest! Try and
find another software developer thatA's half as open as that!) So youA'll have
to tune to the closest value, e.g. tune to 82.10 Hz for low E instead of 82.41
Hz, 196.51 Hz for the G string (my favorite) instead of 196.00 Hz. If youA've
got perfect pitch, this may be a bit annoying, but then again, if youA've got
perfect pitch, you donA't need a guitar tuner!

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
