**Publisher's Description**  
  

miniKeys is a virtual piano for Windows that comes with its own high-quality
piano sounds. It is playable with a computer keyboard, a mouse, or both at the
same time. The sounds were recorded at 16 bits, 22,050Hz.

Although miniKeys is quite responsive, its performance can suffer if too many
applications are open at the same time. Its performance may also be
compromised on processors slower than 400mz.
