**Publisher's Description**  
  


VirtMus (virtual music) is a free application that allows the user to display sheet music and turn pages without removing the hands (or feet) from the instrument the music is performed on. 

This feature is very useful during concerts and practice sessions as it allows the musician to focus on performing the music without interruption. 

The software also allows the users to store and organize their entire sheet music collection on a laptop, making it fully portable and available at a click of a button.

VirtMus allows the user to create "songs" out of sheet music images obtained from a scanner, digital camera, or pdf, and "PlayLists" out of the "songs".

During a performance, the user can simply press a mouse button to move to the next / previous page or press various keyboard keys to advance the music.

Requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 or above. [Get It Here](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp).

**What's New in version 2.51:**

  * Pages from a PDF document can be annotated using an external SVG editor now. 
  * Updates made using an external SVG editor show up right away now.
