**Publisher's Description**  
  

Guitar Instructor helps guitaristAs with chords, scale patterns and chord
progressions. It also provides a simple note-based tuner and simple metronome.
At the moment this is a very basic application but we plan to add a whole lot
more to it. Some of the things we plan to add are more tunings, lessons, and
some more useful tools to help out any guitarist.
