**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Renegade Guitar Tuner was going to be a new feature in Guitar and Drum Trainer 2, but since itA's only in beta, IA've decided to release it on its own. The Renegade Guitar Tuner is free. 

This program is to help you tune your guitar. Just plug-in your guitar to your mic jack and turn up your guitarA's volume. Helpful instructions can be found inside the software.

Click the "Tune me baby~!" button to start it, and then start plucking strings. YouA'll have to tune to numbers (e.g. Low E is 82.41 Hz) for the time being (I said it was beta...). All the notes and their values are readily available in the program. Just scroll down in the text box in the program to see them.

The accuracy is good enough, but not perfect. (Hey... IA'm honest! Try and find another software developer thatA's half as open as that!) So youA'll have to tune to the closest value, e.g. tune to 82.10 Hz for low E instead of 82.41 Hz, 196.51 Hz for the G string (my favorite) instead of 196.00 Hz. If youA've got perfect pitch, this may be a bit annoying, but then again, if youA've got perfect pitch, you donA't need a guitar tuner! 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx).
