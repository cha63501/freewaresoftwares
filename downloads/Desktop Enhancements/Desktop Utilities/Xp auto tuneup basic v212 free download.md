**Publisher's Description**  
  

XP Auto Tuneup Basic is a small yet powerful and very simple DOS script that
uses your XP functions to automatically give your computer a routine tuneup
then shutdown your computer for the evening. No more sitting around for hours
to tuneup our computers, we all hate to do this. Just click one button before
you go to bed or leave the office and walk away. Basic and Plus are both
included in the download, you use the one you choose. XP Auto Tuneup Basic
will do the rest.
