**Publisher's Description**  
  


Customize your keyboard, joystick, and mouse with an open source scripting language that is backward compatible with AutoIt v2. It includes a quick-start tutorial, an automatic script writer (macro recorder) that records your keystrokes and mouse clicks, and a comprehensive help file. 

In addition to its automation features described below, AutoHotkey excels at hotkeys, able to make almost *any* mouse/joystick button, keyboard key, or combination into a hotkey. It can also individually disable or override WindowsA' own shortcut keys, such as Win+E and Win+R. It may also help alleviate RSI; for example, it can create substitutes for Alt-Tab using keys, mouse wheel, or buttons.

Major Automation Features:

  * Define abbreviations that expand as you type them (auto-replace). 
  * Create custom GUI windows and menu bars. 
  * Retrieve or change the volume, mute, and other settings of any soundcard. 
  * Remap keys and mouse/joystick buttons. 
  * Send keystrokes and mouse clicks to any window (without needing to activate it). 
  * Launch programs, shortcuts, URLs, and documents. 
  * Activate, hide, close, or resize any window. 
  * Make a window transparent and/or always-on-top. 
  * Change the priority of a process or close it. 
  * Create custom tray icon menus and popup menus. 
  * Use a joystick as a mouse. 
  * Monitor your system (e.g. close unwanted windows the moment they appear). 
  * Automate game actions by detecting pixel colors. 
  * Retrieve and change the clipboardA's contents, even if it contains files copied from the Explorer. 
  * Perform any operation upon a set of files and folders that match a wildcard pattern. 
  * Read, write, and parse text files more easily than in most other languages. 
  * Work with the registry and INI files using the included interface commands. 
  * Display simple tooltips and balloon tips. 
  * Display dialog boxes to interact with the user. 
  * Convert any script into an EXE that can be run on any computer.
