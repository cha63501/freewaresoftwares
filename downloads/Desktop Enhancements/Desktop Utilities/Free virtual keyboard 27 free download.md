**Publisher's Description**  
  

A free, lightweight, multilingual and finger friendly virtual on-screen
keyboard.

Free Virtual Keyboard works on any Windows based UMPC with a passive
touchscreen (Ultra-mobile PC, Tablet PC and Panel PC). If you spend a lot of
time responding to e-mail or jotting down notes on your mobile computer and
find your hardware keyboard awkward or too small, a screen software keyboard
may be just the improvement youA've been seeking. This handy keyboard has keys
large enough to be typed with the fingertips.

Also Free Virtual Keyboard allows people with mobility impairments to type
data by using a pointing device.

You can change size and transparency of keyboard with one click at any time.
In full-screen mode virtual keyboard automatically resizes to fit the width of
the screen when invoked. This means it works in both landscape and portrait
orientation, something other keyboard does not do.

The autorepeat function (any key held down to repeat same character
continuously) is automatic. All relevant keys would auto-repeat when pressed
continuously.

Free Virtual Keyboard is a totally portable application, meaning that you can
put it on any USB stick and run it directly from there. In this way, your
interactive keyboard will always be with you.
