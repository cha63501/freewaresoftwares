**Publisher's Description**  
  


WinSplit Revolution is a small utility which allows you to easily organize your open windows by tiling, resizing and positioning them to make the best use of your desktop real estate. 

WinSplit is especially useful for high-end LCD screens with high resolutions because it helps you to efficiently manage many active windows. For example WinSplit is useful for owners of the Dell 2407FPW monitor. As you can see in the screenshots below, the advantages of using WinSplit is that it saves you from having to drag and drop windows by allowing you to snap windows into specific tiled configurations using simple keyboard hotkeys.

**Features:**

  * Automated window handling (resize, move, reorganize, close tasks) 
  * Shape - process association 
  * Global hotkeys and clickable virtual numpad 
  * Automatic startup 
  * Automatic update 
  * Moving a window with mouse (dragA'nA'go) 
  * Hotkey configure 
  * Layout configure 
  * Fusion between 2 windows 
  * Minimize/Restore by hotkey 
  * Mosaic mode 

**WhatA's New in version 11.04:**

  * Bug Fix : The settings (including the VirtualNumpad position and style) were not saved when WinSplit was closed by the end of the user's session. 
  * Improvement : The installer and uninstaller language will now be set automatically, regarding the system's language. The registry keys created by the previous installers has been removed, so the 'portable mode' won't touch anything in the registry. 
  * Bug Fix : The update and/or uninstall process fails because of a dll file that can't be replaced. People will probably still encounter problems to update to this release. If so, there is now a 'Cleanup Tool' available in the download page. 
  * Bug Fix : The message 'Impossible to install hooks' was often shown at WinSplit startup, and the checkbox saying 'Do not display this message anymore' wasn't working as expected
