**Publisher's Description**  
  

Backup and restore icons position on desktop (and wallpaper) separately for
all screen resolutions.

In the event that a computer crashes, if automatic desktop icons placement is
selected or if the screen resolution is changed there is the possibility that
the icons shortcuts position on the Windows desktop becomes scrambled;
IconRestorer has been designed to remember the icon setup to avoid the boring
job of manual restoring for the right icons position on desktop after these
events.

IconRestorer can be used to place the icons back to their original location on
the Windows screen when needed, or even to manage two profiles of icon
position.

The icons position on desktop (layout) can be saved manually when wanted
(every screen resolution will be saved separately) and can be restored at any
time (when Windows starts included).
