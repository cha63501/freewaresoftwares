**Publisher's Description**  
  

On Mac or Ubuntu, every time you plug an external hard disk into your
computer, an icon that represents the newly plugged hard disk added to the
desktop. This icon will be automatically removed when the drive is unplugged.
The same thing happens for CD or DVD. That is a simple but neat feature. With
TweakNow DriveShortcut we try to bring this feature to Windows.

When a CD, a DVD, or an external hard disk added or removed from the computer,
Windows will broadcast a message to all running programs to notify them about
this new change. TweakNow DriveShortcut sits quietly on the tray area waiting
for this kind of message. When the message received, depending on the message
content, TweakNow DriveShortcut will automatically create or delete drive icon
from the desktop.

**What's New in version 1.2.0:**

  * General: when creating a shortcut, the 'Start In' field is set using the same value as the 'Target' field. 
  * General: fixed problem with remember shortcut icon position setting on some systems. 
  * General: minor improvements and bug fixes.
