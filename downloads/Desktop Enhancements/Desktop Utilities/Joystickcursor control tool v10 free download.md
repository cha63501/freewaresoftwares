**Publisher's Description**  
  

This tool maps the movement of the first joystick onto the cursor keys (up,
down, left, right). Additionally, it also maps the first joystick button to
the return/enter key, the second joystick button to the tab key and the third
button (if your joystick has one) to the escape key.

Great for scrolling around in the internet browser or similar tools, may also
be handy for windows games which do not support the joystick directly. The
taskbar icon shows the state of the tool. If the joystick symbol is crossed
red, the joystick is not installed or connected properly.

Double-click the icon to close down the tool.

System requirements: Joystick installed as the first joystick, Windows
98/ME/2000 (Win95 is unsupported)
