**Publisher's Description**  
  


ToolTipFixer is a nifty ApatchA for a very frustrating bug in Windows which winds up rendering tooltips behind the taskbar, leaving them unreadable and generally annoying the user to no end. 

ToolTipFixer sits silently and invisibly in the background, intercepting this problem and fixing it as it happens A letting you read those tooltips and use your PC the way you should be able to.

**WhatA's New in version 2.0:**

**1.)** ToolTipFixer 2.0 has been rewritten from scratch in C++ with no dependencies and no longer requires Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0. It doesnA't even need the MSVC++ runtime libraries.

**2.)** ToolTipFixer 2.0 has drastically improved memory management A itAll take so little memory, you wonAt even know itAs there (from 0.3 to 1.5 MiB in our extended testing, depending on OS and platform).

**3.)** ToolTipFixer can now be run in what we call Astandalone mode.A During setup, youAll have the option of either installing TTF the traditional way A as a system application sitting silently and invisibly in the background A or as a standalone module that you run only when you need it. Some people experience the tooltip corruption problem less often than others, and if it doesnAt bother you incessantly then you can choose to only run TTF when you need it!
