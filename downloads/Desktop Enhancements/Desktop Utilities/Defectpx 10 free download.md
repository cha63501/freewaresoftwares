**Publisher's Description**  
  

DefectPX allows you to easily check for dead or defective pixels on LCD
monitors. You can use it to test a new LCD monitor before purchasing, or an
already purchased monitor during the warranty period (you may get a
replacement according to the manufacturerA's dead pixel policy).

DefectPX fills the entire screen with one of the colors that make up a pixel,
allowing you to inspect the screen for pixels that do not match the selected
color. DefectPX can be run directly without having to install it on your
computer: just download and run.
