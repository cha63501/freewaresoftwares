**Publisher's Description**  
  


Display Changer changes the display resolution, run a program, then restore the original settings. It can also change the resolution permanently and rearrange the monitors in a multiple monitor setup. I originally wrote this application for my children because they had programs that require 640x480 with 256 colors or 800x600 with 32-bit color or some other combination. I didn't expect my (then) 4-year-old to be able to change Windows display settings, so I wrote this program to do it automatically. Now, of course, it does much more. 

Display Changer allows you to change your desktop width, height, color depth, and refresh rate (frequency) temporarily or permanently (via command line switches). You can have Display Changer run another application in a specific display resolution and return to the previous resolution when the application finishes. Command line switches let you alter only certain settings and choose the best refresh rate (or a specific one).

Display Changer is free for personal and educational use. 

**What's New in version 4.3.2:**

  * Fix documentation for -top/-bottom switches. It should have read -above/-below. Now they all work.
