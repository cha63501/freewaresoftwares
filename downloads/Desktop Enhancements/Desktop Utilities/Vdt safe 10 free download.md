**Publisher's Description**  
  

This very small program has no installation: just copy and run!. It wants to
be an aid in preserving your eyes at work (or simply browsing the Web) in
front of the computer monitor. It runs in background, and after a
predetermined time (chosen by you freely or among a few options) it remembers
you to get a pause far from the screen. NOTE: it is NOT a simple timer, but it
monitors the userA's activity (keyboard and mouse) and the counter starts and
stops when you start and stop working, all automatically. Of course, itA's
FREE.
