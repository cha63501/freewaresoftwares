This tool can be used to fix most problems in which your normal background is
not displayed. Usually in the backgrounds place there is another image or
website which has hijacked the desktop. This form of hijacking involves
reconfiguring your desktop to display something other than your default
configuration.

You can use Desktop Hijack fix to restore default settings for Active Desktop
and remove any changes that had been made to the desktop background. It can
also be used to backup your current desktop configuration to be restored later
if you choose to not restore default settings. Integrated policy scanning
feature allows you to remove detected policy restrictions which can prevent
you from accessing features of your computer.

During running operation this tool has been designed to alert you if your
desktop settings have been hijacked based off your previous configuration.
Tool will also notify of policy restrictions that may have been enabled by
malware.
