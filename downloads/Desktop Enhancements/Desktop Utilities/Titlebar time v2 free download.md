**Publisher's Description**  
  

Displays the day of the week, the date, and the time in the titlebar of the
active window.

Titlebar TimeA's executive file is a very small file so there will be
virtually no startup lag as a result of Titlebar Time starting when you start
your computer.

You do not have to set the day, the date, or the time. The program gets this
information from your computerA's operating system. Titlebar Date is a desktop
enhancement and will auto start when you start windows. If other users of your
computer want to use Titlebar Date, place a shortcut to Titlebar Date in the
Start MenuA's Startup folder under their profile.

No tray icon to clutter up your tray area.

No Splash Screen. No advertisements. No spam from the producers. No adware.
