**Publisher's Description**  
  

Lots of notebooks, netbooks and cordless keyboards have no indicators for Caps
Lock, and Num Lock. Scroll LockA's bulb disappeared almost from any hardware
for now.

Keyboard Leds software solves this problem. The program lets you know the
current state of keyboard locks. You can see the status either on a small icon
in the system tray or on a floating OSD window.
