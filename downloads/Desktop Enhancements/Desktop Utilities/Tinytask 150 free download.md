**Publisher's Description**  
  

TinyTask provides basic automation (recording and playback). It is a case
study in minimalist programming: the entire program is only 29k -- and 14k of
that are icons, which means the executable portion is just a few K in size. It
was used as the test harness for the "Recording" feature of vTask Studio.

Now includes an EXE compiler! Turn your recordings into standalone programs.
If you were stranded on a deserted island, this is the one program you would
want.

ThereA's no installer, help file, or anything unnecessary; just a tiny EXE
program, which doesnA't touch your registry or change your system folders.
