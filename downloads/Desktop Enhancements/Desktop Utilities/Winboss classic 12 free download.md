**Publisher's Description**  
  

WinBoss lets you hide running applications quickly so that other people will
not notice of what you are doing recently. With a simple keyboard combination
that you can set (by default it would be ctrl-x) the selected application will
dissapear, including from the taskbar, Alt-Tab and the running application
list in the Windows Task manager.

To restore the hidden application(s), just click on the WinBoss icon on the
right side of the taskbar. A popup menu will show with the list of hidden
applications. Click to restore one of it.

WinBoss icon is a green rectangle, which looks like the Windows Task manager
CPU indicator icon.

WinBoss is also useful to reduce the number of button shown on the taskbar by
moving them into the WinBoss popup menu.

WinBoss setting window will be shown for a split second before minimized as an
icon on the right side of the taskbar.
