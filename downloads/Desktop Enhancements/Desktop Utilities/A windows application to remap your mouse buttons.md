**Publisher's Description**  
  


X-Mouse Button Control is a windows application to remap your mouse buttons. You are able to provide an application specific mappings, which means one application can use the mouse differently from another. This is useful for games which do not inherently support the extended mouse buttons, because you can map keys to each button. 

WhatA's more, the list of functions available to map to is somewhat more comprehensive than the 32bit MS Intellimouse Software can handle, including things like: Volume Up/Down/Mute; Media Player control; Send a custom keystroke sequence; and Launch an email application.

**System Requirements:**

  * A mouse and driver that supports 5 buttons. NOTE: If your mouse has 5 buttons but the 4th and 5th buttons don't do anything in XP64 by default - this probably wont work for you. This software relies on the driver to send the default 4th and 5th mouse button messages which in XP64 default to BACK/NEXT in IE. Actually, a 2 or 3 button mouse can be customised but is there any point?! 
  * Windows XP/2003/Vista/7 x64 edition for the 64 bit version 
  * Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/7 for the 32bit version. 

**WhatA's New in version 2.6.2:**

  * Fixed problem causing XMBC not to be launched after installation. 
  * Fixed incorrect default for Cycle Layers, Fixed portable release. 
  * Fixed portable version so it is not signed. 
  * Fixed a problem scrolling OneNote pages view when A'Scroll window under cursor activatedA'
