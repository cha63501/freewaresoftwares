Wallpaper Manager allows you to build saveable lists of local wallpaper image
files that are then loaded into the application at run time to save you from
having to browse your computer for the files. You can manually select files
from the currently loaded list and preview the image and then set the desktop
bg with your selected wallpaper file, or you can configure the application to
automatically cycle through the currently loaded list and change the desktop
bg automatically at the specified interval (hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly)

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
