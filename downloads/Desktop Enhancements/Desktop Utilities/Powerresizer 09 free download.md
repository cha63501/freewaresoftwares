**Publisher's Description**  
  

PowerResizer is a utility that provides many facilities in moving or resizing
windows in a Microsoft Windows desktop environment.

One of the key-features of PowerResizer is window-docking: with PowerResizer
you can organize your window in an intelligent way. Try the following: run
PowerResizer, then dock a window in the left-half of your screen (simply
dragging-it with your mouse to the left of your screen) and another window in
the right-half; now you can resize them using either the left border of the
right window or the right border of the left window... the magic happens!

So, if you want either compare some documents or rapidly resize and move your
windows, PowerResizer allows you to do some actions (such as resizing a window
mantaining its center point fixed) by using some keyboard shortcuts during
moving or resizing that window (see Readme file included in setup package or
sources).
