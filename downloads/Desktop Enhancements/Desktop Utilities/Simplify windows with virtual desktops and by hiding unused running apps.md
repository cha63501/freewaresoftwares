**Publisher's Description**  
  


Use this program to simplify your experience of using Windows, by confining groups of running programs to different "screens" (or virtual desktops), and hiding all running applications other than those on the current screen. As computers become more powerful, it becomes possible to run a great many programs at the same time. This can make the desktop and its task bar crowded and unmanageable. To combat this overload, Screen-It creates 2 virtual desktops (screen pages) on your single physical one. Only one screen page is visible at a time.
