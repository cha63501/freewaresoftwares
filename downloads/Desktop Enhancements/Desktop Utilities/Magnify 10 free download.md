**Publisher's Description**  
  

Magnify follows the mouse anywhere around the screen, and zooms in on any part
of the Windows desktop. You will see the pixels underneath the mouse pointer
in detail in MagnifyA's own window.

You can resize the Magnify window to see more of the desktop, or adjust the
magnification from a level of 1 to 24. Magnify can display a grid so you can
easily count pixels. The RGB values of the pixel immediately underneath the
pointer are shown, so if you like a colour you can easily copy it, onto your
own web-page for example.
