**Publisher's Description**  
  


Power Meter Plus is a superb replacement for the standard Windows power meter icon. The problem with the standard system tray icon is that itA's too small and you have to hover over it to see the remaining time. 

Power Meter Plus is a graphical bar which gradually appears as the power levels drop. The lower the power, the more prominent the meter will be. When youA're charging the laptop itA'll turn green and slowly disappear/fade as the charge increases. The meter appears either on the bottom left or bottom right of the screen; it moves to the opposite corner if you move your mouse over it.
