**Publisher's Description**  
  


Teeny Context is a set of utility commands for file management. Teeny Context starts with a drop of files onto the program icon and prompts the user for a command to perform on the file (a single file is assigned to an instance). The commands include: open the directory, explore the directory, copy the path, and start a command prompt with the current directory set to where the file is placed. 

**WhatA's New in version 2.0.0:**

  * Entire code was rewritten.
  * Abolished: Starting the program without a drop of files.
  * Removed: All the sub-commands.
  * Modified: Some UI text.
  * Fixed: Minor problems.
