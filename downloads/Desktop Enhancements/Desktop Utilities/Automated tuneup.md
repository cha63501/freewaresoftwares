XP Auto Tuneup Basic is a small yet powerful and very simple DOS script that uses your XP functions to automatically give your computer a routine tuneup then shutdown your computer for the evening. No more sitting around for hours to tuneup our computers, we all hate to do this. Just click one button before you go to bed or leave the office and walk away. Basic and Plus are both included in the download, you use the one you choose. XP Auto Tuneup Basic will do the rest.
