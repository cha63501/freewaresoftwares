**Publisher's Description**  
  

Icon Configuration Utility is a program that restores your desktop when the
icons get rearranged.

Operation is easy A press ASaveA to store a particular configuration and
ARestoreA to reset the icons to the saved positions in the selected
configuration file. ADeleteA allows you to remove unwanted configuration files
from the list.

There is a command line option so that the restoration can be run via HotKeys
if required (that is why the script warns that it should be compiled for full
functionality). You can decide what to do with any icons that have been added
since you last saved the configuration file A the default is to put them in
the top-left corner, but you can also banish them way off-screen or, more
sensibly, specify a location for them.

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) 
  * Windows Vista (32-bit) 
  * Windows 7 (32-bit)
