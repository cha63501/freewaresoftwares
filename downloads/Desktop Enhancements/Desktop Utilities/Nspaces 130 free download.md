The fewer Applications that run on one desktop, the more productivity you get.

Sometimes you may have many applications such as mail client, editor and Web
browser running on one desktop, and you donA't want to mess them up. But
things go contrary to your wishes.

Fortunately, with nSpaces you may have separate workspaces (we call them
virtual desktops) for different applications, each workspace (desktop) has
different applications for graphic design, checking mails and writing reports.

**Features:**

  * Launch Desktops: Create multiple desktops on your computer. 
  * Launch Apps: Open different applications on each separate virtual desktops to improve your productivity. 
  * Name your space: label your tag for each virtual desktop, the tag is shown on the space switcher. 
  * Change wallpaper: Your desktop is unique, Set a custom desktop image for each of your desktops and watch as the pictures fade into each other when switching between your desktops. 
  * Color your space: If you donA't like to set a custom image for each desktop, just set a background color for them. 
  * Protect your space: If you donA't like anonymous users to use your spaces, just set a password for them. 
  * Hotkeys for everything: nSpaces has a group of hotkeys for each desktop you created, hotkey for the space switcher. You can change whatever you want.
