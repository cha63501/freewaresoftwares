File Commander helps you save time when organizing the files on your disk. If
you find that youA're moving, copying, or deleting the same files over and
over, you can use File Commander to make a simple command that does it for
you. When you run the command, your files will be moved, copied, or deleted
just as if youA'd done it yourself.

File Commander includes a Wizard for creating new commands, with easy step-by-
step instructions. There are no scripts to write and no technical jargon to
understand.
