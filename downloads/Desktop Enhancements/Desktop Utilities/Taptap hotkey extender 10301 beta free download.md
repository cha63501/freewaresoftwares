**Publisher's Description**  
  

TapTap Hotkey Extender is a tiny super-efficient tray-based utility for
keyboard fanatics.

It monitors for certain unusual hotkey combinations not supported by most
programs (like doubletap right shift key). When such hotkey combinations are
detected, TapTap will simulate a normal hotkey that the user has configured.

In this way, you can configure any of your programs to respond to these
extended hotkey events as if they supported it natively.

Example: You might have a program which normally triggers on Alt+Ctrl+F5, but
you want to configure it to trigger with a double tap of the right control
key. You can use TapTap to detect Right Control Doubletap events, and send a
Ctrl+Alt+F5 when it does. In this way, you can control your programs the way
you want to, and they never know the difference.

TapTap Hotkey Extender is written in lean and mean C++ and highly optimized
for insignificant cpu/memory access. It makes no changes to any system files
and is completely safe. Comes with an installer but you can unpack the
download manually and run it without installing.
