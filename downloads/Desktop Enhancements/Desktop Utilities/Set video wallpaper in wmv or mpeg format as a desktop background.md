**Publisher's Description**  
  


There are probably many people, who may remember that some versions of Windows Vista had an effective function called DreamScene. It allows to set video wallpaper in .wmv or .mpeg format as a desktop background. 

Instead of this Windows 7 has a wallpapers slide show. However DreamScene is not gone away, it was only deactivated and hidden deep within the system. DreamScene Seven allows you to activate this function again.

After the program is downloaded, it is necessary to run the file with administrative privileges (right button click is the run as Administrator). Then you have to select the button A'Install DreamSceneA'.

Now a new item "Set as Desktop Background" will appear in the Video File Context Menu, with the help of which it can be set as a desktop background. So it only remains to visit DreamScene gallery and choose an appropriate video clip for the desktop, there is definitely a wide choice - more than hundred of selective scenes.

It is known that DreamScene wastes a lot of system resources while running. However, if a window is open to the entire screen (or a game is running), replaying of movie comes to a halt and the system resources are not wasted.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes 3rd party software which does not have to be installed to use the software.
