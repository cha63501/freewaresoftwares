**Publisher's Description**  
  

TrayDevil is a Window to Tray Minimizer with a set of powerful extra tools: It
can Hide the TrayClock, disable a windowA's Min, Max and Close button, set
windows On Top, Shutdown, Restart, Stand By, Hibernate, LogOff, Lock your
system and Turn Off your Monitor.

TrayDevil can also automatically run a program (e.g. backup) before it shuts
down your system, triggered by a CPU-usage threshold.

TrayDevilA's interface was translated in 7 languages (briefly) and is prepared
for personal translation.
