**Publisher's Description**  
  

Taekwindow is a simple, lightweight and free Windows program that allows you
to move and resize windows by dragging them with the Alt key, similar to many
X11 window managers.

Taekwindow allows you to do the following:

  * move a window by grabbing it anywhere (not just the title bar) while holding the Alt key, and then dragging with the left mouse button; 
  * resize a window by grabbing it anywhere (not just the tiny little border) while holding the Alt key, and then dragging with the right mouse button; 
  * move a maximized window between monitors by Alt-dragging; 
  * use the scroll wheel on the window under the cursor, instead of the currently focused window; 
  * push a window to the background by middle-clicking on its title bar. 
All these features can be configured to your liking.
