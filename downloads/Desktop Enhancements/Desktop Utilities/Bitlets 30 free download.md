**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bitlets - those scraps of information that you remember you once read
somewhere but you havenA't a clue where and you wish you had kept a copy!

This is a convenient desktop program for those scraps. It is in effect a free
form database with a single key field and additionally, grouping. Keep notes,
recipes, addresses, program bits, snippets of interest or almost any sort of
text information tucked away for when you may need it.

Quick and simple, copy and paste or set the program to monitor the clipboard.
You can also set the program to automatically save bitlets, enhancing your
clipboard by saving all text you copy to clipboard for future use. If you are
a little paranoid about some or all of your data then you can also encrypt it
using RC4.

**WhatA's New in version 3.0:**

  * This upgrade adds unicode
