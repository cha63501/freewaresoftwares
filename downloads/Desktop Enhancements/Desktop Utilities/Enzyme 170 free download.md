Enzyme lets you control your computer the way you like. Change monitor
brightness, system volume, window transparency, and many more features with a
mouse gesture, a joystick, a keyboard or even speech.

Actions are customizable and conditional groups are supported, so that a
certain mouse movement may play/pause a song on media players but refresh an
internet page on browsers.
