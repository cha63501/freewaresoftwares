**Publisher's Description**  
  

grepWin is a regular expression search and replace utility. grepWin uses the
boost regex engine which allows you to perform complex searches using special
text strings. In addition to custom search patterns, you can also limit
searches based on file size, file types, certain directories, and more.

Because regular expression search strings can become quite complex, grepWin
includes a presets list for your commonly used expressions. Additionally,
grepWin can be accessed from the context menu to quickly search selected
folders.

If youA're not familiar with regular expressions or want to learn more, a
[basic tutorial](http://tools.tortoisesvn.net/regexhelp.html) is available.

A [64-Bit version of
grepWin](http://grepwin.googlecode.com/files/grepWin-1.6.1-64.msi) is also
available.
