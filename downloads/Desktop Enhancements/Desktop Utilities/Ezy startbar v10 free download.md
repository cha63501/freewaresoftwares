**Publisher's Description**  
  

Ezy StartBar adds a supplemental Start Menu SideBar to your Windows Taskbar,
and provides quick access to groups of menu items. It offers more flexibility
than the standard Windows Start Menu, and the number of shortcut is virtually
unlimited. You can manage Ezy StartBar exclusively using your mouse.

Ezy StartBar behaves like the standard Start Menu, but also allows you to
create groups of shortcuts, which can be added, edited and deleted on the fly,
with full drag and drop functionality. You can drag shortcuts onto any group
in the SideBar when Ezy StartBar is "pinned" to your Desktop.

A program (.exe file) or a shortcut to a program can be added to the Ezy
StartBar SideBar by either pinning the SideBar and dragging and dropping a
file or a shortcut onto a Group, or by using the File Open dialog whether the
SideBar is pinned or un-pinned.

A group or an item can be renamed, edited, or removed from the SideBar by
right-clicking it and using the commands available from the popup menu. The
order of the items in a group can be arranged by dragging and dropping them to
the preferred position within a group or from one group to another.

Unlike the standard Start Menu, a SideBar link item created from a shortcut
that is subsequently moved or deleted will still work, as the Ezy StartBar
link points to the actual file location not the shortcut.
