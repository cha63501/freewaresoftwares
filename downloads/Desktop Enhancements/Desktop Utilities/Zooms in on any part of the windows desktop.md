**Publisher's Description**  
  


Magnify follows the mouse anywhere around the screen, and zooms in on any part of the Windows desktop. You will see the pixels underneath the mouse pointer in detail in MagnifyA's own window. 

You can resize the Magnify window to see more of the desktop, or adjust the magnification from a level of 1 to 24. Magnify can display a grid so you can easily count pixels. The RGB values of the pixel immediately underneath the pointer are shown, so if you like a colour you can easily copy it, onto your own web-page for example.
