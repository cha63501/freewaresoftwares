**Publisher's Description**  
  

The purpose of this program is simple: to hide some selected windows in one
keypress.

Plancoin lets you set up two hot keys: one to hide the windows and show them
back, and one to show the Plancoin Settings window. The program then runs in
background and responds to the hot keys.

To determine which windows must be hidden, you have to set up a list of
sentences. In the Include mode, every window whose title contains one of the
sentences will be hidden. This mode is the default one. In the Exclude mode,
every window whose title does not contain any of the sentences will be hidden.

As Plancoin needs to run in the background all the time, it has been designed
to use as few system resources as possible.
