**Publisher's Description**  
  

Use this program to simplify your experience of using Windows, by confining
groups of running programs to different "screens" (or virtual desktops), and
hiding all running applications other than those on the current screen. As
computers become more powerful, it becomes possible to run a great many
programs at the same time. This can make the desktop and its task bar crowded
and unmanageable. To combat this overload, Screen-It creates 2 virtual
desktops (screen pages) on your single physical one. Only one screen page is
visible at a time.
