**Publisher's Description**  
  

With Advanced Shortcuts Composer you can create shortcuts to run programs with
a pre-defined destination, priority and keyboard hotkeys to activate. This
means that you can:

  * Select the destination where a programA's shortcut will be created (Desktop, IE Favorites, SendTo context menu, Start Menu, Start Menu Programs, Windows Startup). 
  * Define the programA's (which a created shortcut is corresponding) running priority (Low, Below Normal, Normal, Above Normal, High, Realtime). 
  * Set a preferable hotkeysA' combination (in order to activate any created shortcut from your keyboard). 
With Shortcuts Patcher (part of Advanced Shortcuts Composer) you can patch any
existing shortcut with a desirable priority level.
