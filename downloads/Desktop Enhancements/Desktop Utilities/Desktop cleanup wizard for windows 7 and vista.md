CleanDesktop is a Desktop Cleanup Wizard for Windows 7 and Vista. Unlike in Windows XP, Windows 7 or Vista, does not include a Desktop Cleanup Wizard, which kept track of your usage of the icons on your desktop and offered to remove the unused icons every 60 days. 

CleanDesktop is a small portable freeware app which will help you clean up your desktop icons which have not been used in the last 30 days. This utility is for those who miss the wizard!
