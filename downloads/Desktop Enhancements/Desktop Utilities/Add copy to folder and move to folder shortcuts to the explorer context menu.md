Context Power is a very small utility that adds "Copy To Folder" & "Move To Folder" shortcuts to the explorer context menu. With the help of this, you can directly copy or move files and folder to a particular location. 

It does not need any installation. Just download the small EXE, execute it and forget it.

Context Power is very simple to use. It has a very simple but powerful interface that allows you to add or remove "Copy To Folder" & "Move To Folder" from the explorer context menu. These shortcuts are very useful as you need not copy or cut the files and then paste them... You will be asked for the destination directly thus making copying and moving much easier and faster and also saving valuable time!
