**Publisher's Description**  
  


MacroMaker allows the user to build macros and assign them to hotkeys to automate tasks. The user can build a macro to simulate a series of keystrokes, execute built in functions or play back a previous recording with just a keystroke. With the copy and paste functions available you can feasibly have a clipboard, which can store text only, assigned to every key on the keyboard amongst other prebuilt functions.
