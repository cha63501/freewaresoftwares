**Publisher's Description**  
  

Your Menu allows you to add custom menu items that display when you right-
click on a Windows 7 desktop. It does not work for other Windows versions.

It does not modify the registry; rather, it creates a registry file you
double-click to install yourself. This way you know exactly what changes have
been made. In addition, an undo file is also created so that you can remove
any entries that you created with Your Menu.

Your Menu supports both single entry menu items and cascading menus.
