**Publisher's Description**  
  


DefectPX allows you to easily check for dead or defective pixels on LCD monitors. You can use it to test a new LCD monitor before purchasing, or an already purchased monitor during the warranty period (you may get a replacement according to the manufacturerA's dead pixel policy). 

DefectPX fills the entire screen with one of the colors that make up a pixel, allowing you to inspect the screen for pixels that do not match the selected color. DefectPX can be run directly without having to install it on your computer: just download and run.
