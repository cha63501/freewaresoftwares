**Publisher's Description**  
  


BitRule is a free screen measurement tool that is much easier to use than the cumbersome screen ruler and caliper products that mimic their physical counterparts. 

Just click on two points on your screen, and get the horizontal, vertical and diagonal distances, as well as the angle to the horizontal.

BitRule measures in pixels, inches, centimeters and picas.
