**Publisher's Description**  
  

Aero Adjuster is a small program that adds a bit of Windows 8 functionality to
Windows 7. It sits in the tray, automatically detects when you change your
wallpaper/when it is changed as part of Win 7A's desktop slideshow, and
changes the Aero color to fit that wallpaper.

If you donA't like it, you can always restore the color to the point before
the tool was opened.

**WhatA's New in version 1.8.5.1:**

  * There was an embarrassing bug in Aero Adjuster which prevented it from successfully updating on some machines
