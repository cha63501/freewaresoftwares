**Publisher's Description**  
  


A visitor in the developerA's support forum asked if there was a way to quickly display the "Find Computers..." dialog box in Windows 2000. Show Find Computers v1.0 is the application that was created. All you do is run it and it opens the correct window and then closes. The Application itself is hidden so it appears that it just opens the windows.
