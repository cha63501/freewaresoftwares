**Publisher's Description**  
  


Have you ever connected your computer to an old crappy monitor which doesnA't handle the resolution youA've selected. Well I have, so therefore IA've created this application where you select a resolution, for example 640x480, so that in the case of the situation above, youA'll only have to press Ctrl+Alt+S, and it changes to the selected resolution. 

Furthermore, the application resides in the systray, and if you click on it you can easily change resolution without having to open Display settings.
