**Publisher's Description**  
  

KatMouse is used to enhance the functionality of mice with a scroll wheel,
offering A'universalA' scrolling: moving the mouse wheel will scroll the
window directly beneath the mouse cursor (not the one with the keyboard focus,
which is default on Windows OSes). Another feature involves the wheel button.
Since the wheel button is not consistently used in Windows, KatMouse can use
it for a kind of task switching: with a click of the wheel button you can push
a window to the buttom of the stack of windows that is your desktop, making a
recovered window the active window.
