**Publisher's Description**  
  


Icon Configuration Utility is a program that restores your desktop when the icons get rearranged. 

Operation is easy A press ASaveA to store a particular configuration and ARestoreA to reset the icons to the saved positions in the selected configuration file. ADeleteA allows you to remove unwanted configuration files from the list. 

There is a command line option so that the restoration can be run via HotKeys if required (that is why the script warns that it should be compiled for full functionality). You can decide what to do with any icons that have been added since you last saved the configuration file A the default is to put them in the top-left corner, but you can also banish them way off-screen or, more sensibly, specify a location for them.

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) 
  * Windows Vista (32-bit) 
  * Windows 7 (32-bit)
