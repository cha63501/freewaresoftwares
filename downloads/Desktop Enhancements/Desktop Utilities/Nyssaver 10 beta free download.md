**Publisher's Description**  
  

nysSaver is an automatic system of administration of energy savings. Is in its
beta version because we believe that with the suggestions of those who
downloaded it can improve more.

The idea is that by using fuzzy logic rules, we can optimize the shutdown time
of the screen monitor so that if I use a lot, the shutdown time is longer, but
if you use less, then goes shutdown quickly.

We want to have many downloads, and adding all the small savings, will help to
reduce wastage of energy on the planet. Setup is simple: just install and then
you can see an icon in the taskbar, where clicking the left button you can
change the sensitivity and, with the right mouse button, other options.

It is silent and uses few resources.
