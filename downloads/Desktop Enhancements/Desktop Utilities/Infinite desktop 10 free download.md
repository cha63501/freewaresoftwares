**Publisher's Description**  
  

This program simulates the moving of app windows in a synchronistic fashion.

When the cursor is at the left edge of the screen all visible application
windows move to the right, and vice versa when the cursor is at the right edge
of the screen.

The speed of movement is also defined by how close the cursor is to the bottom
of the screen. There is also the option to show all windows so that you donA't
have to hunt for them all if you scroll them too far away and forget their
positions. There is also the option of enabling/disabling the effects of this
program at your will.

There was a problem trying to get it to run on a 32 bit version of Windows
Vista, which is understandable, so at some point IA'm going to have someone
with a 32 bit machine compile it for compatibility.
