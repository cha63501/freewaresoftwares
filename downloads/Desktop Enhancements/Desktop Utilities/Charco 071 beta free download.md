**Publisher's Description**  
  

Charco makes it possible to recode character sets, much like iconv on Linux
does, but in a more portable way and with a GUI for easy-of-use.

Charco contains an interface to a character set conversion facility. With this
application, you can turn a string represented by a local character set into
the one represented by another character set. Charco supports the most common
character set encodings found on Windows, OS X and Linux, including a full
complement of UTF-encodings.
