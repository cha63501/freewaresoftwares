Tray Date is a very small program that displays the current date in an attractive tray icon. 

Tray DateA's executive file is a very small file so there will be virtually no startup lag as a result of Tray Date starting when you start your computer.

You do not have to set the date. The program gets this information from your computerA's operating system. Tray Date is a desktop enhancement and will auto start when you start windows. If other users of your computer want to use Tray Date, place a shortcut to Tray Date in the Start MenuA's Startup folder under their profile.

No Splash Screen. No advertisements. No spam from the producers. No adware. Tray Date does not create a bunch of folders and files to clutter up your computerA's file system with little programs that are going to advertise to you stuff you do not want, do not need, and do not want to see even if it might have a dancing rabbit.
