**Publisher's Description**  
  


iColorFolder is a useful utility that will organize and change your folder icon. 

To begin, the program has been entirely rewritten in C++ ; thus the .NET Framework is no more needed. Then, Flyakite told me how to do to take in count the changes to the folder immediately ; you donA't need anymore to refresh Explorer view to see the new color or icon of a folder.

Finally, about the skins, the Vista skin has been updated, with the help of Nobo. The SnowE2 skin has been removed from the default pack, and been replaced by the gorgeous Agua skin, made by Ced with David LanhamA's icons.

iColorFolder skin pack which allows you to fully customize everything in your folders is [available for download](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_2_4_18758.html) on FreewareFiles.com.

**Features:**

  * Organise your files more easily 
  * With iColorFolder, give some color to WindowsXP folders. With just a right-click, colorize your folders, and discover a new intuitive way to classify your files. A quick view is now enough to identify the folder you are looking for ! 
  * Classify your folders by Family 
  * You can now classify your folders by Family. Red is an Important folder, Orange is Urgent, Green is Familial... Choose the attributions that you like, so youA'll never delete an important folder by error. 
  * A fast and light tool 
  * iColorFolder is a very light soft, that doesnA't stay in memory. It uses a native functionnality of WindowsXP to be more efficient.
