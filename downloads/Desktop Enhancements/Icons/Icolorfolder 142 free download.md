**Publisher's Description**  
  

iColorFolder is a useful utility that will organize and change your folder
icon.

To begin, the program has been entirely rewritten in C++ ; thus the .NET
Framework is no more needed. Then, Flyakite told me how to do to take in count
the changes to the folder immediately ; you donA't need anymore to refresh
Explorer view to see the new color or icon of a folder.

Finally, about the skins, the Vista skin has been updated, with the help of
Nobo. The SnowE2 skin has been removed from the default pack, and been
replaced by the gorgeous Agua skin, made by Ced with David LanhamA's icons.

iColorFolder skin pack which allows you to fully customize everything in your
folders is [available for
download](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_2_4_18758.html) on
FreewareFiles.com.
