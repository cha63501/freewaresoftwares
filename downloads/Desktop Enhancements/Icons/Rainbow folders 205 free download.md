**Publisher's Description**  
  

Rainbow Folders (RF) is an easy to use program, which allows you to change the
color of the icon representing a chosen folder to any color you like. Why is
this necessary? Mainly to boost yours computer usage speed & skills.

When youA're exploring a directory which contains lots of subdirectories in
Windows Explorer you can easily commit a mistake, e.g. by clicking the
folderA's icon which has a similar name to the one you really wanted to go to.
With the folders marked with the colors of your choosing, you wonA't make any
mistake and after some time youA'll be clicking the right folders by impulse.

For example, you can use RF to mark subdirectory TEMP inside C:\WINDOWS\\.
Then after going to the system dir you wonA't be searching the TEMP dir on the
whole screen, but at the start you will click e.g. the eye attacking bloody
red folder. And now the best part: you can colorize an unlimited number of
folders - each into a different color. So you can e.g. colorize all important
folders red, then colorize all frequently visited folders to green etc. Also
the effect of colorizing folders is not only visible in Explorer but in whole
system, so also in any directory selection tree, and open/save dialog in any
Windows application! But changing colors is not everything you can do with
help of RF, you can also set an extra warning when someone tries to delete a
colorized folder, and optional text that will A'pop upA' when the cursor stops
above the folderA's icon for a while.
