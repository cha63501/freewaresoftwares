So, what is your Windows lock screen?

Your Windows lock screen is the image you get when you need to enter your password to login to Windows 7 or when you press ALT-CTRL-DEL and lock your machine.

The image is the usual boring Microsoft blue image with some leafs on it! So, you want to change this to your own image or maybe simply add your company logo to the existing one, either way, with our new utility this is simple.
