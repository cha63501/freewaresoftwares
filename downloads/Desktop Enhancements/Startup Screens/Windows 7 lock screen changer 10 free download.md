**Publisher's Description**  
  

This small standalone utility is designed to change your Windows 7 lock screen
easily and quickly to a custom image of your own choosing.

With this utility, you can import your own custom JPG image into the tool,
preview the image to ensure you have chosen the correct one that you want to
use and then apply it to be your new Windows Lock Screen.

So, what is your Windows lock screen?

Your Windows lock screen is the image you get when you need to enter your
password to login to Windows 7 or when you press ALT-CTRL-DEL and lock your
machine.

The image is the usual boring Microsoft blue image with some leafs on it! So,
you want to change this to your own image or maybe simply add your company
logo to the existing one, either way, with our new utility this is simple.
