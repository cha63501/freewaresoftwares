**Publisher's Description**  
  


Windows Sidebar Styler - an application designed to allow Windows Vista users to tweak the SidebarAs User Interface. In addition to the normal, resource-related view, the application provides a preview mode where the user can see what the Sidebar would look like if the style is applied (it works provided that Sidebar is available and loaded). 

Implemented is support for WsStyles files that let you create style files and share them with other users easily.

An automatic back-up file is always created before applying a style so that an earlier version of the executable can be restored.
