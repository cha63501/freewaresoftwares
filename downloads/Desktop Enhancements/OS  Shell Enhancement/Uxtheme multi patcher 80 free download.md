**Publisher's Description**  
  

Uxtheme Multi-patcher will allow you to use any 3rd party msstyle theme on
Windows XP/SP1/SP2 or Windows Server 2003 (with Themes enabled) just by
patching the uxtheme.dll (dynamic link library).

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program offers to change the homepage during the installation process.

**What's New in version 8.0:**

  * Added Windows 7 Service Pack 1 compatibilities check 
  * Removed software incompatibilities restriction check since memory-patching is still safe in this case so user can use it in any platform regardless of being beta or newer 
  * Updated patching engine to Rafael's latest UXStyle.com
