**Publisher's Description**  
  

fungusTabs is a free and useful tabbed window manager. The concept came from
craeonics and his wish for something to run on Windows that was like LinuxA's
Fluxbox. It just so happened that I had a tabbed window manager already, but
it was very limited in capabilities. So we began working together to make it
come to life.

The current feature set is somewhat limited, but includes the ability to
specify activating, drawing, grouping, moving, positioning, and sizing
settings.

No registry entries are made, so just delete the fungusTabs main directory to
uninstall.

About Alphaware

fungusTabs has only been tested on XP and 2K and is still a work-in-progress,
so is certain to contain some bugs. If it crashes (which hasnA't happened here
in quite some time, but you never know with alphaware,) leaving windows
"lost," just restart it and then shut it down normally. This should recover
all of the lost windows and make them visible again.

Tabbed Windows?

Okay, we all know what a tab is, right? So what fungusTabs does is place a tab
on the outside of each main, or top-level window. You may then group the tabs
together to form tab sets. What a tab set does is present all of its windows
in a familiar bar of tabs, one tab for each window in that tab set group. In
addition, only the tab setA's active window is shown; all of its non-active
windows are moved off of the desktop. What you end up with is a desktop with
fewer windows displayed but with ready access to them all.
