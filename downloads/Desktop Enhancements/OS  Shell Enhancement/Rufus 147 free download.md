**Publisher's Description**  
  

Rufus is a small utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash
drives, such as USB keys/pendrives, memory sticks, etc.

It can be be especially useful for cases where:

  * you need to create USB installation media from bootable ISOs (Windows, Linux, etc.) 
  * you need to work on a system that doesnA't have an OS installed 
  * you need to flash a BIOS or other firmware from DOS 
  * you want to run a low-level utility 

Despite its small size, Rufus provides you with everything you need!

Remember that once formatted, your drive is still usable as before to transfer
data: it doesnA't have to be dedicated for DOS or ISO installation only.

**WhatA's New in version 1.4.7:**

  * Add VHD support as a target 
  * Add ReFS support (only for Windows 8.1 or later and only for fixed drives) (NEW) 
  * Add Japanese translation 
  * Add Slovak translation 
  * Add Swedish translation 
  * Improve the display of filesizes when copying content 
  * Fix FAT32 cluster transitions 
  * Fix unpartitioned drives not always being listed 
  * Fix bad blocks report 
  * Other minor fixes and improvements
