**Publisher's Description**  
  

Ext2Fsd is an open source linux ext2/ext3 file system driver for Windows
systems (NT/2K/XP/VISTA, X86/AMD64).

Ext2fsd is very stable for normal works, with writing access enabled. The
performance comes to be an issue when thereA's heavy I/O operations.

If you really need very heave writing I/O jobs, it is strongly recommended you
to create an ext2 partition as a swap between windows and linux systems.
