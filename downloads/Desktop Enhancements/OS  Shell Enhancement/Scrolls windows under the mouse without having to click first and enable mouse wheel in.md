**Publisher's Description**  
  


WizMouse is a mouse enhancement utility that makes your mouse wheel work on the window currently under the mouse pointer, instead of the currently focused window. This means you no longer have to click on a window before being able to scroll it with the mouse wheel. This is a far more comfortable and practical way to make use of the mouse wheel. 

WizMouse can also optionally enable the mouse wheel in applications that donA't support it. It does this by translating mouse wheel commands into scroll bar commands that all applications can understand and process.

  * Scrolls windows under the mouse without having to click first 
  * Enables the mouse wheel in applications that donA't support mouse wheels 

Once WizMouse has been installed and is active, configure it by double clicking on the WizMouse icon in the system tray.

**WhatA's New in version 1.7.0.3:**

  * Reverse mouse scrolling (if enabled) will no longer reverse scroll when the control key is down. This is the way Mac OS behaves.
