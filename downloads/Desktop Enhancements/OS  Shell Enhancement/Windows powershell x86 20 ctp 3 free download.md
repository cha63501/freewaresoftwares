**Publisher's Description**  
  

Windows PowerShell V2 CTP3 introduces several significant features to Windows
PowerShell 1.0 and Windows PowerShell V2 CTPs that extends its use, improves
its usability, and allows you to control and manage the Windows environment
more easily and comprehensively.

  * Many features introduced in previous CTPs were modified based upon customer feedback. If your scripts used those features, they may have to be modified to run properly. A list of the changes is provided in the Release Notes. 
  * This CTP3 release is designed to provide a preview of key V2 features to the community and solicit feedback about them. 
  * Windows PowerShell V2 CTP3 release is compatible with and replaces previous versions of Windows PowerShell. To install the Windows PowerShell V2 CTP3 release you must uninstall any previous version of Windows PowerShell. 
  * Windows PowerShell V2 CTP3 uses the execution policy setting from the previous installation, if present. The Windows PowerShell installer does not remove or change the execution policy when you uninstall Windows PowerShell. 
  * In Windows PowerShell V2 CTP, the WS-Management-based remoting features work correctly only on Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and on Windows Server 2008. These remoting features will not work on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 in this release. 
  * Windows PowerShell background jobs (jobs) rely on the remoting features of Windows PowerShell V2. To use jobs, Windows PowerShell remoting must be enabled, even if the job runs only on the local computer.
