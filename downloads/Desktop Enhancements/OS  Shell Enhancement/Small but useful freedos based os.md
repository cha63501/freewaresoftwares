**Publisher's Description**  
  


GeekDOS is a free FreeDOS based OS by Benjamin Dibell that boots from CDs and DVDs, USB drives, Hard disks, and a minimalistic version from floppy via an included script. 

GeekDOS includes an installer that installs GeekDOS to the first recoginized supported filesystem. GeekDOS will start to a fully usable environment whether or not installed, with little if any difference when installed. It includes many small open source or abandonware utilities and games, as well as the built-in now open source DOS Navigator GUI. I hope you find GeekDOS useful, Ben Dibell.

The CD and USB images are LiveCDs that boot to a fully functional GeekDOS install, and they permit the installation of GeekDOS to your hard disk. 

**BEFORE INSTALLING:** realize that the GeekDOS file system creator does not always work on every disk. We recommend creating a small partition and formatting it before installing GeekDOS. This greatly improves the odds of a successful install.

**Note:** This download is an .iso file that needs to be burned to CD/DVD. Once burned to CD/DVD, users must boot their PC from CD/DVD drive.
