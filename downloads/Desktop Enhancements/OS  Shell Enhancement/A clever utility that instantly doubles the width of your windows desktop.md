DoubleDesktop is a smart and elegant system tray utility that effectively doubles the width of your Windows desktop. ItA's simpler to use than many similar programs: just mouse-click on its icon or hit a keystroke combination to switch between "left" and "right" parts of the desktop. This lets you easily rearrange all your application windows between the two desktop parts. 

To move a window from the one virtual screen to another, just drag the window beyond the right or left screen boundaries. Then, switch the desktop and pull the window the rest of the way through. You can choose different wallpaper and desktop iconsA' title colors for both screens.

Exiting DoubleDesktop returns your main desktop back to its normal state, with all programs intact.
