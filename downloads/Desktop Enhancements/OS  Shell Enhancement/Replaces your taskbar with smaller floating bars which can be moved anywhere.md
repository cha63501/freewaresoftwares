GeoShell replaces your taskbar with smaller floating bars which can be moved anywhere you want and allows you to skin and use only the features you want, keeping resource and memory usage to a minimum. You can launch programs from buttons, menus, and hotkeys - in any combination. It gives you complete control, allowing you to group similar tasks into one button and minimize, restore, or even exit them all at once. It also lets you keep an eye on things by providing plugins for monitoring system resources, battery life, web-pages, news, weather, etc.
