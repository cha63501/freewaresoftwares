**Publisher's Description**  
  

Keep Running allows you to launch a program and/or ensure it stays running.
This could be to restart a crashed application or prevent something from being
closed accidentally. Also useful in a kiosk, library, school, website demo, or
web-based application such as a self-registration/signup type of environment.

Optionally you can use Keep Running as a custom shell so an application such
as Internet Explorer is the only available program and to automatically re-
launch it or restart the machine if closed.
