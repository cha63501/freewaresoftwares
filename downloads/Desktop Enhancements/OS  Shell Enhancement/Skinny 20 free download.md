**Publisher's Description**  
  

Skinny is a program meant to help the user in patching the system, replacing
the original component, Auxtheme.dllA, with a custom one that allows the
system to use non MS-signed themes.

The user, after the patch, will be free to choose between hundreds of high
quality themes available for download (mainly for free) from many internet
sources, rather than from the scarce pool of choice of MS-signed themes, but
of course the system will still be able to use MS-signed themes via the custom
Auxtheme.dllA.

Due to the unclear license status of the patched Auxtheme.dllA versions
available online, generally distributed as free for personal use, the dll
itself is not included in the program and it must be downloaded separately by
the user from one of the many sources available on the net.

Requirements: patched uxtheme.dll
