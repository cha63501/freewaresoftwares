Copy+Size extends the standard Copy function for a graphic file by adding the ability to re-size it before it is pasted. The re-sized image is saved to a file and paste details placed on clipboard. A wide range of image formats can be processed. It is used for a single file only. 

This update extends the options available and fixes a minor bug.
