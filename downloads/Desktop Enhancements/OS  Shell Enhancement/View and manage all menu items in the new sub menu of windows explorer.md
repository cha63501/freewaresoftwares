**Publisher's Description**  
  


ShellMenuNew is a small utility that displays a list of all menu items in the A'NewA' sub-menu of Windows Explorer. It allows you to easily disable unwanted menu items, so this A'NewA' sub-menu will display only the items that you need. 

**Notice:** When you enable or disable a menu item and then immediately right-click in Explorer, you wonA't see the change yet. Only after you open the new menu in the second time, youA'll see the effect of your disable/enable change. ItA's not a bug in ShellMenuNew, it simply the way that Explorer new menu is loaded.

Also, be aware that under Windows 2000/XP, A'Automatic Desktop RefreshA' option must be checked in order to see the disable/enable changes. If this option is not set, youA'll see the change only after reboot. Under Windows 7/Vista, A'Automatic Desktop RefreshA' option is not required. 

**What's New in version 1.02:**

  * Fixed bug: if ShellMenuNew disabled a menu item, and then another software created this menu item again, ShellMenuNew displayed this menu item as disabled while it was actually active.
