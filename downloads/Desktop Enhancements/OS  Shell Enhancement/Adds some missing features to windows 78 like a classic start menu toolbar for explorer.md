Classic Shell is a free program that brings back Windows XPA's popular shell features to Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 users. It was initially developed in 2008 to replace VistaA's user interface. As users became more disappointed with the features that were missing in later versions of Windows, the development of the program continued, and it currently has three major components: Classic Start Menu, Classic IE and Classic Explorer. 

**Main Features**

  * Customizable Start Menu 
  * Caption and status bar for IE 
  * Status bar and toolbar for Windows Explorer 
  * Find documents, files, programs and settings 
  * Quick access to pinned, frequently-used and recent programs 
  * Latest version supports animated start buttons 

This means Classic Shell is not only meant for Windows 8 but also Windows Vista and 7. It replaces the Windows 7 Start Menu with the Classic Start Menu found in Windows XP. However, this does not mean it will make your system exactly like Windows XP, as it does not bring back everything found in XP. The latest versions support Windows 8.1.

**Using Classic Shell**

The installer gave us the option to install all three Classic ShellA's components or choose the one to install. The latest version offered us more customization options. For example, we chose from several styles of Start Menu whose appearance we could customize to suit our own preferences. We also had the option to replace the Start button with our own preferred design.

We used the Classic Start Menu to put the commands we used frequently onto the top right section for fast access. We also used Classic Explorer to make common features more accessible. However, it is important to note that Classic Explorer does not replace the conventional Windows Explorer but only adds some UI elements to it, making it more useful. In fact, Classic Shell uses features and functions of the stock Windows operating systems to make them easier to access and use.

Although Windows 8.1 has brought back the Start button, it simply takes users to Windows 8 Metro Start page, which is full of tiles that many people do not like. At least many people are not used to the new Start page. Classic Shell entirely replaces the Start button in the latest Windows operating system with the Start Menu.

We found it relatively easier to add and move programs than in Windows 7 Start Menu. For example, we only had to drag and drop program icons onto the menu to add them or change their order. We could also easily remove items from the menu. In addition, we could specify command line options and add links to batch files and other programs.

**Conclusion**

Classic Shell makes it easier to use the Windows operating system, especially the latest Windows 8.x versions. The program does not simply change the UI but helps people to be more productive because they can access commonly used features faster. Although the software is no longer open-source, you can still download and use it free of charge.
