**Publisher's Description**  
  

Right Click Context Menu Adder itAs a free and portable utility which allows
you to add your favorite program shortcut, website link, file or folder
shortcut in Windows 7 and Windows 8 Desktop context menu quickly and easily.
You will not need to modify Windows Registry yourself, this software will do
the job for you.

**How to use it?**

You just need to run this tool and select the desired item which you want to
add in Desktop context menu. You can select any of the following items to add
to context menu:

  * Program
  * Folder
  * Web Address
  * Any type of file
If you select "**Show only when SHIFT key is pressed**" option, the new
shortcut will only be shown in Desktop context menu when you press SHIFT key
while right-clicking on Desktop. ItA'll not be visible normally. So you can
enable this option for those shortcuts which you donA't use regularly or want
to hide from others.

You can also tell the software whether the new shortcut should be added to
Desktop context menu only or should the software add the new shortcut to
folder context menu as well. If you select the 2nd option, the shortcut will
also be visible when you right-click on a folder.

Once a new shortcut is added, you can remove it later using 2nd tab. Simply
select the desired item from the list and click on "Remove" button.

This software comes in 2 languages, English and Portuguese, however it
supports multiple languages. So you can translate it to your language if you
want to and share it with others.

**We also have thinking about people with small resolution screens!**

If your monitor resolutions itA's under 1024x768 pixels you might noted that
the Right Click Context Menu Adder covers almost your full screen. For that,
we added the option to switch to Compact mode and the Right Click Context Menu
Adder will become smaller.

Just click at the bottom of the window of Right Click Context Menu Adder to
switch to Compact Mode which will reduce the size of the window. Click on
Extended text to return to normal size.

This software is highly customizable and works perfectly without any problem.
The best thing is that its portable so you donA't need to install it. Simply
run the EXE file and add desired shortcuts in Desktop context menu.

If you want to run this from a pen drive or other portable device, select the
option to save the settings in File in program folder under the settings tab.

It can be used in both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows editions.
