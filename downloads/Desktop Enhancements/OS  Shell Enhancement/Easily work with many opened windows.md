Desktop Slider makes it very easy to work with many opened windows. There is even no need to minimize any window. 

One way to see Desktop Slider is that the program makes the desktop or workspace "infinite". And the computer screen is like a camera that show just part of the desktop. You can move the camera by moving the mouse while holding keyboard or mouse buttons. That way you can put your windows side by side and move along them.

  * Customizable: Buttons, velocity are configurable.
