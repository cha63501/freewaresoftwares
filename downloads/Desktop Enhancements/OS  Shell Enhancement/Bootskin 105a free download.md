**Publisher's Description**  
  

Stardock BootSkin is a program that allows users to change their Windows 2000
and Windows XP boot screens.

Unlike other programs that can change the Windows XP boot screens, BootSkin
does so in a safe manner. It doesnA't patch the Windows XP kernel. Nor does it
require the user to download replacement Windows XP kernels to do so.

Boot screens that use BootSkin are typically under 20K compared to other boot
screen programs whose files are over 2 MEGABYTES.

And best of all, BootSkin is free for non-commercial use.
