**Publisher's Description**  
  


VirtuaWIn is a virtual desktop manager to organize applications over several "virtual" desktops. For example if you use two virtual desktops you can put a Web browser on desk 1 and by using a desktop manager "switch away" the Web browser and it will seem like you have a new empty workspace (desk 2) to put another application/applications on.
