**Publisher's Description**  
  

I know a lot of people were disappointed by the lack of a decent boot logo in
Vista, so IAve thrown together a tool that should simplify the process of
creating the new high resolution boot logos!

Your works of art need to be saved as 24-bit BMPs, and youAll need to create
them in two sizes: 800A600 and 1024A768. On my machine the boot logo always
defaults to 1024A768, but I assume the 800A600 version automatically kicks in
if your graphics card is rubbish Once youAve selected your two images, just
click File -> ASave Boot Screen File AsAA and it will generate the logo file.
To make the logo come up during boot, youAll need to copy the file to the
following folder:

%windir%System32en-US

YouAll also need to make sure the /NOGUIBOOT option is enabled in the MSCONFIG
tool, otherwise youAll only get the old 16 colour boot screen. For full
details, make sure you read the info during setup.

**IMPORTANT:** ItAs still beta and there may be bugs so use at your own risk, and make sure you backup first!
