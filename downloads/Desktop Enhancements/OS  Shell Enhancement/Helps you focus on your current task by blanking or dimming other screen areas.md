**Publisher's Description**  
  


CinemaDrape helps you focus on your current task on the screen (such as a video in a web page, a photo or a document editor area) by instantly blanking or dimming the other less important areas in a web page or in the background windows. 

With CinemaDrape you no longer have to manually clean up your working screen area, close windows, or watch lower resolution videos in full screen mode just to get rid of disturbing side elements or ads.

CinemaDrape is easy to start: just move your mouse over the area you want to focus on and press your own favorite custom keyboard combination. This works in any Web browser or in any other program you are using. CinemaDrape is also easy to close: just press Escape or select Quit from the context menu. And the program does not require any memory or an extra tray icon when the drape is not active.

In CinemaDrape you can easily: move or resize the focus area using the mouse or arrow keys, change the color or opacity of the drape that covers the less important screen areas, and save your favorite focus areas for future use.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) or above.
