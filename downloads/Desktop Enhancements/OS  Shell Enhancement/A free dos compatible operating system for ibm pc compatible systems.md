FreeDOS is a free DOS-compatible operating system for IBM-PC compatible systems. FreeDOS is made of up many different, separate programs that act as "packages" to the overall FreeDOS Project. 

These days, there are three main uses of FreeDOS:

  1. To run old DOS games (like DOOM, etc.) 
  2. To run old business software that only supports DOS 
  3. To support an embedded DOS system, such as a computerized cash register or till 
You can run FreeDOS on pretty much anything. While can run FreeDOS on a dedicated PC, now itA's most often run inside a PC emulator. You can find PC emulators for all computer platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac.) 

**Note:** This download is an .iso file that needs to be burned to CD/DVD. Once burned to CD/DVD, users must boot their PC from CD/DVD drive.
