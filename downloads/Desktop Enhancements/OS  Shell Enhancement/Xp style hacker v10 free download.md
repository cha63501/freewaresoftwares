**Publisher's Description**  
  

Get your old Win32 apps looking like their Windows XP counterparts! XP Style
Hacker is a small unique tool that instantly transforms applications that do
not recognise Windows XP visual styles to be "style aware". Just select the
EXE file from the program dialog and the next time you run the program it will
adapt to your current XP theme. XP Style Hacker creates a manifest file that
is placed in the program`s folder and automatically used by it. It does not
modify the program in any way. To remove the syle support, simply delete the
manifest file. The program works with all Win32 programs that use a standard
Windows interface and controls.
