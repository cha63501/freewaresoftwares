**Publisher's Description**  
  

envedit is a Windows Environment Editor. Use it to edit all your user and
system environment variables, such as the PATH. I made this tool as the built-
in Windows editor (Start | Control Panel | System | Advanced | Environment
Variables) is definitely one of the worst user interface examples ever
created.

envedit is different from other environment editor tools in that it offers two
free-form edit windows. Changes to the complete text will be parsed and
applied to the Windows environment keys in the registry.
