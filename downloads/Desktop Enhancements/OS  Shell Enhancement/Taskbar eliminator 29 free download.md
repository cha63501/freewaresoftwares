Aviassin Taskbar Eliminator is a great utility which will simply and
efficiently remove the taskbar from Windows.

With just the click of a button or a hotkey, the taskbar is disabled from any
side of the screen, providing the freedom to use any dock application,
increase computer security, or allow all sorts of Windows customizations. The
taskbar can be toggled on and off in real-time, providing the flexibility to
quickly view the taskbar to perform an action.

The application interface is simple and easy to understand, allowing it to be
used by even the most novice of users. Simply press and hold Control+Alt+T to
bring up the Preferences window, from which all options can be adjusted. Press
and hold Control + T to immediately show or hide the taskbar directly.

Taskbar Eliminator can easily be set to start with Windows, so your taskbar
can be automatically hidden before your computer is even started up.
