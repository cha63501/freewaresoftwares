**Publisher's Description**  
  

As Windows XP is here and not all the older programs can take advantage of the
xp themes option (xp visual styles or xp skins), the developer created a
program to resolve this problem with one click. XP Skins is a Windows XP
utility that helps you change the look of older windows programs with one
click of the mouse. Now all your programs will support XP skins (Windows XP
themes).
