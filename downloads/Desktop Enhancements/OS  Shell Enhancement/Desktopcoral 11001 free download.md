**Publisher's Description**  
  

DesktopCoral is an unusual program designed to "reserve" some portion of your
desktop which is shielded from maximized applications..

Essentially, it acts like an invisible resizable docking bar, which can be
docked to any side of your desktop. This invisible dock acts as a barrier to
maximized applications and essentially shields this area of your desktop from
other applications.

Within this shielded area you might put certain application windows that you
want to be always visible, or you might put one of the many desktop tools like
a calendar or system information component.
