**Publisher's Description**  
  


Entering special characters can be challenging, especially if you want to write fast. Fortunately, WinCompose makes the process as easy as using keyboard shortcuts. You do not need to go to the application, make your selection and then insert it in the program you are working on. 

If WinCompose is not already in your system tray, then launch it manually and start a compose sequence by pressing and releasing the Alt key. You then just need to type the relevant keyboard combination to enter the special character or symbol you want.

The application accepts many keyboard sequences, and hovering on its icon displays the number of loaded sequences. You can see the list of sequences by clicking on the applicationAs icon in the system tray. Alternatively, you can click on AShow SequencesAA menu entry.

You can set the duration you want to pass from the time you press a keyboard combination to the time the application adds the relevant symbol. You can choose between 500 milliseconds and 10 seconds. You can also change the initiation key if you do not want to use the Alt key.

By default, WinCompose comes with over 1,000 rules, and you can add your own rules. However, an upgrade overwrites the custom rules.
