**Publisher's Description**  
  


XPMe can give all programs a minor facelift and let them use XP-style buttons and other controls. Most older programs work as well in Windows XP as in the operating system for which they were first created. Unfortunately, they do usually look dated compared to their designed-for-XP rivals.
