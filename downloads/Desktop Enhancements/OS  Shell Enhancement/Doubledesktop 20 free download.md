**Publisher's Description**  
  

DoubleDesktop is a smart and elegant system tray utility that effectively
doubles the width of your Windows desktop. ItA's simpler to use than many
similar programs: just mouse-click on its icon or hit a keystroke combination
to switch between "left" and "right" parts of the desktop. This lets you
easily rearrange all your application windows between the two desktop parts.

To move a window from the one virtual screen to another, just drag the window
beyond the right or left screen boundaries. Then, switch the desktop and pull
the window the rest of the way through. You can choose different wallpaper and
desktop iconsA' title colors for both screens.

Exiting DoubleDesktop returns your main desktop back to its normal state, with
all programs intact.
