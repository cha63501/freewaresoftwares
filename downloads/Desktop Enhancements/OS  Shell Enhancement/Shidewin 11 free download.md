**Publisher's Description**  
  

ShideWin enumerates all top-level windows and allows you to show or hide them.

It can help you get back windows that were made invisible for some reason:

  * Your multiple virtual desktop software crashed 
  * The window is only accessible via the system tray and the icon disappeared (when explorer.exe is killed for instance) 
  * YouA've hidden it with ShideWin ;) 
It can also be interesting to see what windows are actually in your desktop
environment without you even being aware of it.
