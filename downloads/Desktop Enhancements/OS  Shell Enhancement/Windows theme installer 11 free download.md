**Publisher's Description**  
  

Windows Themes Installer is a freeware portable utility which allows you to
install a theme, remove a theme and restore defaults easily in Windows 7 &
Vista.

Windows does not allow you to install 3rd party themes. You have to patch some
system files to be able to do so. This new version will automatically patch
the system files without the need of a 3rd party system file patcher. If the
system files are already patched then it does nothing. To restore the patched
files you will need to use [Universal Theme
Patcher](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/patch-system-files-apply-3rd-party-
themes-on-windows-7-vista) or [UxStyle Core](http://www.thewindowsclub.com
/how-to-install-themes-on-windows-7-vista-easily).

**WhatA's New in version 1.1:**

  * This new version will automatically patch the system files without the need of a 3rd party system file patcher.
