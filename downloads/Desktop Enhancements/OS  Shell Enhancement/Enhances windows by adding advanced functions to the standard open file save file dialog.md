**Publisher's Description**  
  


FileBox enhances Windows by adding several advanced functions to the standard Open File and Save File dialog boxes. (Note that if a program uses its own "private" dialog boxes for these functions, you wonA't see our FileBox buttons, sorry.) 

FileBox adds two handy buttons to these standard dialogs. These appear on the right side of the Windows dialog box title bars. These buttons appear next to the minimize, restore, and maximize buttons with which youA're probably already familiar.

FileBox can also forcibly resize the standard Windows file management dialog boxes so theyA're bigger, and thus easier to use if youA've got lots of files in a folder through which you need to look. 

These special buttons will appear for all styles of file dialogs (the old Windows 3.1 style file dialog boxes, new "Explorer" style boxes introduced with Windows 95, and even with the latest file dialog boxes in MS Office and Windows XP).

And donAt worry---if you donAt like the pictures on our buttons, thereA's a very easy way to change them.

FileBox eXtender has a nifty option to display these buttons on Windows Explorer folders too, and this can greatly speed up navigation through todayA's huge hard disks.

**What's New in version 2.00.04:**

  * Removed "Do not use XP style buttons" option on "Settings" tab. 
  * Added "When rolled up, keep the window bar on top" option to "Settings" tab.
