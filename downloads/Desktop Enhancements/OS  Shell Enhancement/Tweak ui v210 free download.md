**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Windows shell-development team did some extra programming and put together
a set of tools called Power Toys. If youA're a power user, go ahead and try
them out, but be forewarned that Power Toys arenA't supported by Microsoft
because theyA're not part of Windows. This group of "toys" lets you adjust
your Windows user interface, including menu speed, window animation, and
Microsoft Internet Explorer.
