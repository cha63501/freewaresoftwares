**Publisher's Description**  
  

OblyTile is specifically designed to help users create tiles to their Windows
8 Start screens. The user-friendly program does not require any learning curve
to apply effectively.

Once you have launched OblyTile, you can either specify the path to the
application or program whose tile you want to create or write a tile name. The
program allows you to add pictures stored on your computer to the tiles you
are creating. Compatible image formats include JPG, JPEG, PNG and BMP. You can
also choose your preferred text and background colors to personalize your
tiles. You may use accented letters if you want.

You will see the modifications you make to your Start screen as soon as you
make them.

Besides using the program, you can also configure how it functions and
appears. If you do not want to choose colors each time you create a new tile,
you can set it to assign random colors or remember the last used color. The
program allows you to delete tiles by right-clicking them and selecting
ARemove From Start.A

Other things you may configure include rebuilding the cache, hiding the
program, running it with administrative rights or allowing only a single
instance.

OblyTile allows you to create your own tiles to different versions of Windows
8 so long as you have basic computer knowledge.
