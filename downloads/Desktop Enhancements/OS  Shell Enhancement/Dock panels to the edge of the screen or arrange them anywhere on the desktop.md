Desktop Sidebar provides you with instant access to the information you most desire by grabbing data from your PC and the Internet. The result is a dynamic visual display you configure and control.

All panels are configurable with a number of specific options. With hundreds of skins available on our Web site and an easy-to-use Skin Editor, you can freely change the appearance of Desktop Sidebar to suit your tastes. 

Available panels: Newsroom, Calendar, Tasks, Inbox, Notes, Performance, Mail Checker, Clock, Messenger, Miranda IM and ICQ, Media Player, WinAmp, Volume Control, Toolbar, Weather, and Search Bar.
