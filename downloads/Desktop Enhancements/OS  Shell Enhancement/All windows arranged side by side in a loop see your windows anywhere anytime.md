**Publisher's Description**  
  


Deskloops is a friendly little program that helps you view and organize all the open windows on your desktop. Deskloops automatically aligns your windows side by side into a virtual loop. Move your mouse to quickly spin the loop to the window you want. The drop-down Strip shows all your open windows as thumbnails. From the Strip, you can do anything with your loop: save, organize, edit, search and even e-mail it to others. You can see all your open windows anywhere anytime. 

Simple. Fast. Easy. Once youAre in the loop, youAll wonder how you ever managed without it.

How does it work? 

Imagine yourself at the center of a virtual loop where all the windows you use are spread out around you. Whichever window you need to view can be centered in front of you with a click of a button.

With Deskloops, all the windows you have open are aligned side by side in a loop. No more countless windows arranged one on top of the other in a confusing manner. You can access all the information you need and navigate through it easily. The loop can be rotated clockwise and counterclockwise simply by moving the cursor to the edge of the screen and using right click.

Think of the loop as a dynamic rubber band; with each newly opened window the loop automatically grows. With every closed or minimized window, the loop becomes smaller. Anytime you want to return to the desktop, double click on Deskloops tray icon and the windows will shift aside in one swift motion.
