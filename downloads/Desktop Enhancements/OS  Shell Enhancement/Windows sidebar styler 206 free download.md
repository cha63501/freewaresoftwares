**Publisher's Description**  
  

Windows Sidebar Styler - an application designed to allow Windows Vista users
to tweak the SidebarAs User Interface. In addition to the normal, resource-
related view, the application provides a preview mode where the user can see
what the Sidebar would look like if the style is applied (it works provided
that Sidebar is available and loaded).

Implemented is support for WsStyles files that let you create style files and
share them with other users easily.

An automatic back-up file is always created before applying a style so that an
earlier version of the executable can be restored.
