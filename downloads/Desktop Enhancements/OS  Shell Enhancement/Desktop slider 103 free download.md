**Publisher's Description**  
  

Desktop Slider makes it very easy to work with many opened windows. There is
even no need to minimize any window.

One way to see Desktop Slider is that the program makes the desktop or
workspace "infinite". And the computer screen is like a camera that show just
part of the desktop. You can move the camera by moving the mouse while holding
keyboard or mouse buttons. That way you can put your windows side by side and
move along them.

**Features:**

  * Freeware: The program is free for use. 
  * Portable: All configurations are stored in an .ini file in the same folder of the application. 
  * Customizable: Buttons, velocity are configurable. 
  * Snap to border: Windows will snap to screen border if this option is set.
