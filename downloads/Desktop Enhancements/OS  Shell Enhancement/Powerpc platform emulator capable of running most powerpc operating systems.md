**Publisher's Description**  
  


PearPC is an architecture-independent PowerPC platform emulator capable of running most PowerPC operating systems, such as Mac OS X, Darwin and Linux. It is released under the GPL. It can be executed on Microsoft Windows, Linux and other systems based on POSIX-X11. 

PearPC is currently in development and is advancing quickly in speed, stability and features. It is hoped to achieve the goal of 1/10 host speed, ie. the speed of a 300 MHz PowerPC G3 on a 3 GHz Intel Pentium 4, relatively soon.
