**Publisher's Description**  
  


GodMode Creator is a freeware utility which lets you create 38 AGodModesA in Windows 7 & Vista, 32-bit, with a click. 

There is nothing magical about the GodMode. Windows has a set of certain folders which are identified by unique strings referred to as CLSID or Windows Class Identifiers. These folders can be accessed by using the CLSID identifier codes that Windows assigns to each individual folder in the Windows Registry. If you know the codes, you can launch these with ease.

In short, GodModes are nothing but developer shortcuts built into Windows 7 & Vista, that enable easy access to certain settings and information about the operating system.

Using GodMode Creator, you can create these shortcuts easily. Simply click on the desired button and it will create the Special Folder or AGodModeA shortcuts on your desktop.

**Note:** While the program may work on x64 versions too, AGodModeA is known to be incompatible with 64-bit versions and could crash explorer.exe. If you find that this makes your explorer.exe unstable or makes it crash, use the cmd to delete this folder, as mentioned at the end of [this page](http://www.winvistaclub.com/g31.html). If you use 64-bit Windows and are in doubt, best you not use this program.
