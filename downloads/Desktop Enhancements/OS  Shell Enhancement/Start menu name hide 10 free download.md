**Publisher's Description**  
  

Start Menu Name Hide will hide or show the current users name on the start
menu.

Sometimes when you have a kiosk, or demo machine, you may want the windows
session to be generic as possible. This includes the name that is sprawled
across the top of the start menu.

Especially when you are making a video of a demo you donA't want your name all
over it. Unfortunately Microsoft did not make an easy way to shut this feature
off.

Start Menu Name Hide is a very small, simple and easy-to-use tool to set it
for you if you donA't like messing around in the registry.
