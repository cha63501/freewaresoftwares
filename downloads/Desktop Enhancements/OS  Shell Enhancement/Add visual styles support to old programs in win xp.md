As Windows XP is here and not all the older programs can take advantage of the xp themes option (xp visual styles or xp skins), the developer created a program to resolve this problem with one click. XP Skins is a Windows XP utility that helps you change the look of older windows programs with one click of the mouse. Now all your programs will support XP skins (Windows XP themes).
