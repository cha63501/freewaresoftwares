**Publisher's Description**  
  

While you can always use the AAuto hideA feature to hide the taskbar and make
it appear only when you take your mouse pointer down to the bottom of the
desktop, Hide Taskbar lets you hide only the taskbar, and not the Start
Button, with a click.

Simply download and run the portable app. Use hotkeys Ctrl+Esc to hide or un-
hide the taskbar.

And why would you require such a program? The reason could be well, you love a
clean desktop and donAt want even a taskbar to mar your wallpaper or maybe you
are working on something and you want to suddenly hide all the other minimized
windows or well it could be simply because you think it looks cool to hide and
un-hide the taskbar.
