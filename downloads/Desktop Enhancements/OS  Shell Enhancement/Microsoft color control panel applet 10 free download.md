**Publisher's Description**  
  

Microsoft Color Control Panel Applet adds a new A'ColorA' item to the Windows
control panel, providing a single place to view and edit color management
settings in Windows XP. Using it, you can install and uninstall color
profiles, change color profile associations for displays, printers and
scanners, view detailed properties for color profiles (including a 3D
rendering of the color space gamut), and rename color profiles, keeping the
filenames and "internal" names consistent.

This tool also enables Windows to automatically adjust the gamut curve of the
display when a color profile containing gamut table information is set as the
default profile for the display. Typically, such profiles are created by
custom monitor calibration tools, such as those available from ColorVision,
GretagMacbeth, and X-Rite. If a color profile has this information, it is
shown with an asterisk (*) in the user interface.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
nloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows
XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
