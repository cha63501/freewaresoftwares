**Publisher's Description**  
  


Start++ is an enhancement for the Start Menu in Windows Vista. It also extends the Run box and the command-line with customizable commands. For example, typing "w Windows Vista" will take you to the Windows Vista page on Wikipedia! 

Advanced functions can work with search results, powered by Windows VistaA's integrated desktop search engine. For example, typing "play radiohead" will find all music that matches the query "radiohead", compile the results into a .M3U file, and launch it in your favorite media player (actually, it only uses Windows Media Player for the moment, but that will change soon).
