**Publisher's Description**  
  

SkinCalc, which is completely free, features standard and advanced calculator
functionality, a spreadsheet interface, and skins.

Skins make it possible to change the layout and functionality of the software,
with effects that include non-rectangular shapes, user-configurable
transparency and alpha channel translucency.

The current version of the calculator engine was designed to be a fully
skinnable application which can completely replace the Windows system
calculator operating in Standard mode, with the addition of certain advanced
features not available in the system calculator.

More than 100 skins are available from the sites listed at skincalc.com, which
also has instructions to create your own skins.
