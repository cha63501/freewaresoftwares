**Publisher's Description**  
  

XPMe can give all programs a minor facelift and let them use XP-style buttons
and other controls. Most older programs work as well in Windows XP as in the
operating system for which they were first created. Unfortunately, they do
usually look dated compared to their designed-for-XP rivals.
