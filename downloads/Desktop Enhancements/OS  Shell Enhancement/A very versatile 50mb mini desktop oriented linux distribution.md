**Publisher's Description**  
  


DSL is a very versatile 50MB mini desktop oriented Linux distribution. 

Damn Small is small enough and smart enough to do the following things:

  * Boot from a business card CD as a live linux distribution (LiveCD) 
  * Boot from a USB pen drive 
  * Boot from within a host operating system (thatA's right, it can run *inside* Windows) 
  * Run very nicely from an IDE Compact Flash drive via a method we call "frugal install" 
  * Transform into a Debian OS with a traditional hard drive install 
  * Run light enough to power a 486DX with 16MB of Ram 
  * Run fully in RAM with as little as 128MB (you will be amazed at how fast your computer can be!) 
  * Modularly grow -- DSL is highly extendable without the need to customize 
This download is an .ISO file. Burn to CD/DVD or mount the .ISO image to install.
