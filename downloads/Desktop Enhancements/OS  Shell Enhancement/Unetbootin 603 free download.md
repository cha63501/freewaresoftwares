**Publisher's Description**  
  

UNetbootin allows you to create bootable Live USB drives for a variety of
Linux distributions from Windows or Linux, without requiring you to burn a CD.
You can either let it download one of the many distributions supported out-of-
the-box for you, or supply your own Linux .iso file if you've already
downloaded one or your preferred distribution isn't on the list.

UNetbootin can create a bootable Live USB drive, or it can make a "frugal
install" on your local hard disk if you don't have a USB drive. It can load
distributions by automatically downloading their ISO (CD image) files, or by
using existing ISO files, floppy/hard disk images, or kernel/initrd files, for
installing other distributions.

UNetbootin can also be used to load various system utilities, including:

  * Parted Magic, a partition manager that can resize, repair, backup, and restore partitions. 
  * Super Grub Disk, a boot utility that can restore and repair overwritten and misconfigured GRUB installs or directly boot various operating systems 
  * Backtrack, a utility used for network analysis and penetration testing. 
  * Ophcrack, a utility which can recover Windows passwords. 
  * NTPasswd, a utility which can reset Windows passwords and edit the registry. 
  * Gujin, a graphical bootloader that can also be used to boot various operating systems and media. 
  * Smart Boot Manager (SBM), which can boot off CD-ROM and floppy drives on computers with a faulty BIOS. 
  * FreeDOS, which can run BIOS flash and other legacy DOS utilities. 

**System Requirements:**

  * Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7, or Linux. If you are having trouble with the Linux version, try the Windows version, it usually works better. 
  * A broadband internet connection to download the distribution's .iso file (unless you're using pre-downloaded files)
