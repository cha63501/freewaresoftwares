FreeDOS is a free DOS-compatible operating system for IBM-PC compatible
systems. FreeDOS is made of up many different, separate programs that act as
"packages" to the overall FreeDOS Project.

These days, there are three main uses of FreeDOS:

  1. To run old DOS games (like DOOM, etc.) 
  2. To run old business software that only supports DOS 
  3. To support an embedded DOS system, such as a computerized cash register or till 
You can run FreeDOS on pretty much anything. While can run FreeDOS on a
dedicated PC, now itA's most often run inside a PC emulator. You can find PC
emulators for all computer platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac.)
