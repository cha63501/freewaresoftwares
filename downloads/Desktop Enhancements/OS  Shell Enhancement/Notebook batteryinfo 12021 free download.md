Notebook BatteryInfo displays the mobile computer battery charging capacity.
By default Windows has only a small battery icon in the Taskbar as capacity
display. BatteryInfo places a battery symbol panel left beside the Taskbar
Icon area. The battery symbol can display additional information like current
power consumption or the remaining time.

Notebook BatteryInfo also reads out all information of the battery (i.e.
battery maufacturer, designed capacity, battery wear level,...) and is able to
display this values.
