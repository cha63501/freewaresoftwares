**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Vistapack, is a Shell pack based on the XPize installer. Its goal is to
let users of Windows XP experience the Vista look and feel, without paying the
price in money and speed.

Currently, there are about 240 separate files that get modified by this pack.
The pack comes with some nice extraA's, like 32bit icon support on Windows
2000! Vista sound and cursor schemes, custom boot screen, and its own
wallpaper.

The pack uses ResHacker (best for scripting resource tasks) to change icons,
bitmaps and some dialogs, to make it look like the new Microsoft Windows
Vista.

The installer takes a sample of the file that has to be modified, and backs it
up. Then it changes all the resources in the original file, those that are
needed for the Vista look. When thatA's done, it places it back into the
system, and will reboot for the changes to take effect.

Vistapack has some other advantages like the Reloader. This little sub-
program, runs on Windows start and checks if any files are changed. This can
happen if you got a update from Microsoft, or have visited the Windows Update
site. When it spots a changed file, it will "Reload" that file with the Vista
resources again. So on your next reboot, that file is Vista style again. Good
way of keeping your system in the Vista look and feel.
