**Publisher's Description**  
  

CinemaDrape helps you focus on your current task on the screen (such as a
video in a web page, a photo or a document editor area) by instantly blanking
or dimming the other less important areas in a web page or in the background
windows.

With CinemaDrape you no longer have to manually clean up your working screen
area, close windows, or watch lower resolution videos in full screen mode just
to get rid of disturbing side elements or ads.

CinemaDrape is easy to start: just move your mouse over the area you want to
focus on and press your own favorite custom keyboard combination. This works
in any Web browser or in any other program you are using. CinemaDrape is also
easy to close: just press Escape or select Quit from the context menu. And the
program does not require any memory or an extra tray icon when the drape is
not active.

In CinemaDrape you can easily: move or resize the focus area using the mouse
or arrow keys, change the color or opacity of the drape that covers the less
important screen areas, and save your favorite focus areas for future use.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
