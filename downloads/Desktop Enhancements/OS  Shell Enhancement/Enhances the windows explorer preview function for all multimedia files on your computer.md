Anyone who has ever experienced the frustration that results from using Windows Explorer to look for specific videos out of several similar ones will appreciate the help of Media Preview. The default Windows application performs rather poorly when it comes to choosing previews of media files, which sometimes become more confusing than helpful. Performance issues sometimes do away with thumbnails all together. For example, when many large files are stored in the same folder or the remaining drive space is small, Windows Explorer displays icons instead of thumbnails. 

**Media Preview Features**

  * Compatible with over 25 file formats 
  * Detects image relevance to avoid displaying black thumbnails 
  * Ensures the uniqueness of each file using different media file sequences 
  * Eliminates the constraints that lead to unnecessary notifications 
  * Compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems 
  * Does not interfere with system performance and stability 

**Using Media Preview**

The video thumbnail generator is easy to set up. We simply clicked the ASelect AllA tab under AFile FormatsA in the Media Preview Configuration panel. We then clicked AApply,A AOKA and then AExitA to complete the setup.

We chose to make our program compatible with audio and image formats too during setup by selecting their respective tabs and selecting all file types. The slider bar under the ASettingsA enabled us to adjust speed versus quality depending on our preferences. By default, the program chooses the highest quality. The rendering of thumbnails happened almost instantly when we chose speed but took some seconds when we chose quality, with the delay depending on the number of files in a folder and size of thumbnails.

When we ticked the ACustomizeA check box, the program activated other preferences that we could adjust with sliders. Hovering over the sliders displayed information about what they did. Note that the speed/quality slider becomes inactive when you tick the ACustomizeA check box.

Media Preview is an unobtrusive program that works silently behind the scenes. Once we had configured it, we used Windows Explorer normally. We noticed that the changes updated automatically even though we already had Explorer running.

We found it easy to identify and select the files we wanted because even the ones that originally displayed no thumbnails showed relevant images that we readily associated with them. We also noticed that it changed the images that were formerly displayed on some files. The thumbnails were useful considering that we had some files with similar names except for numbers differentiating them, such as example1, example2, etc.

**Pros**

  * Easy to configure 
  * Compatible with many file types 
  * Makes it easy to identify image and video files 
  * Fast rendering of thumbnails 

**Cons**

  * Not compatible with DAT files 
  * Does not change black images already displayed on a few files
