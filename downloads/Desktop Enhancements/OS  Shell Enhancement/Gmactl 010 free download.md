**Publisher's Description**  
  

Absolutely free, very small and useful program to change and restore (after
reboot) LCD screen "hardware" brightness on Intel GMA family video adapters
(all Atom laptops and much more). Program permanently "live" in taskbar of the
Windows (right-bottom place near watch) and show small icon with current
brightness in percent.

Brightness levels percentage is 0, 8, 13, 19, 26, 36, 50, 70, 100
("progressive" row), but You may change it by editing INI file. Tested on
Samsung N145 and Windows XP SP3 only (sorry, but other hardware not available
for me). Works with Asus eeePC (based on eeectl source code).

Use Alt+Win+Up and Alt+Win+Down (default) for change screen brightness.

Based on eeectl source code.
