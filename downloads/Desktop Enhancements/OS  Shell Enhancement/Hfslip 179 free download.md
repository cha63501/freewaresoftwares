**Publisher's Description**  
  

In a nutshell... HFSLIP is an open source utility designed to update a Windows
2000, XP or 2003 installation source with the latest hotfixes.

The binaries (individual files) of fully supported hotfixes are slipstreamed
directly. This means that original files are being replaced with the newer
versions present in the hotfix executables you can obtain from the Microsoft
Download Center.

In the rare occasion that a hotfix isnA't supported (usually because of it
being a non-standard package or requiring a special installation procedure),
it is integrated instead. HFSLIP leaves these uncommon hotfixes or updates as
they are and places them in the SVCPACK folder, to be installed automatically
near the end of Windows setup.

HFSLIP is also capable of slipstreaming:

  * select Service Packs (see SP slipstreaming for more info) 
  * Windows Update Agent and Windows Genuine Advantage 
  * Internet Explorer 6 and Outlook Express 6 (Windows 2000) 
  * DirectX 9.0c (Windows 2000, Windows XP SP1 and Windows 2003) 
  * Windows Media Player 9 (Windows 2000) 
  * Windows Media Player 10 (Windows XP) 
  * Windows Media Player 6.4 codecs (Windows 2000) 
  * Windows Media 9/10 codecs (Windows 2000, XP and 2003) 
The HFSLIP project focuses on critical updates reported by the Windows Update
or Microsoft Update web sites. However, all optional updates that show on
those sites are currently supported.

For experts and "advanced users" alike, HFSLIP offers additional features such
as removing Internet Explorer from Windows 2000 (courtesy of Fred Vorck),
reduction of your Windows source, individual source file replacement, codecs
slipstreaming, support for "Application Addons", and many more.

**What's New in version 1.7.8:**

  * Added support for KB951376 for WinXP. 
  * Allowed slipstreaming of WMP10 onto XPSP3. 
  * Current cumulative ActiveX KillBits are force-added (override with NoKillBits=YES). 
  * Blocking Windows Installer 4.5 and Windows Search.
