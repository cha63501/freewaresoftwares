**Publisher's Description**  
  

Virtual Desktop Toolbox is the first professional tool that enlarges your
monitor by dynamically creating multiple virtual or non virtual desktops. You
can organize programs and windows by categories in different desktops, share
programs and windows between desktops, group your desktops within a virtual
screen and easily and quickly (one mouse move) switch from one desktop to
another one. Virtual Desktop Toolbox can expand your desktop as large as you
wish.

Using scenarii and AutoRun, you can prepare desktops and programs for later
use, either for yourself or for other users. Moreover, you can impersonate
other users while staying in a single Windows session.

Using built-in tools, you can easily (dragA'n drop, contextual menus,
tooltips, ...) customize your workplace and Windows notification area. To make
desktops and windows management easier, you can now use the tremendous visual
menu, that allows to manage and view all desktops within a single pane.

Finally, using the built-in Remote Desktop feature of Windows XP, you can link
a remote computer to a desktop and control it just like you are on that
computer (drivers, printers, sound, ... can be shared).

Virtual Desktop Toolbox exists in english, french, italian, portuguese,
spanish and german.
