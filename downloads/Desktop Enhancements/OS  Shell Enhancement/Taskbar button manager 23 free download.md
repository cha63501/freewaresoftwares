Taskbar Button Manager is a simple utility that helps you arrange the buttons
on your Windows taskbar in any way you want by using drag and drop. Moving
your task buttons is very easy, no hotkey needed.

In addition to drag and drop you can also use a special program window for
moving the taskbar buttons. You can hide running programs too, so they donA't
show on your taskbar. The program works in all situations A even when the
taskbar buttons are grouped or when the taskbar is not located in the standard
bottom area of the screen.
