If you use some folders frequently, then you will appreciate a program that can help you quickly access the folders, and this is what Folders Popup does. This handy application allows users to move between their frequently used folders like a breeze using both keyboard and mouse shortcuts. The free portable application is designed in AutoHotkey scripting language. 

**Main Features:**

  * Adding, removing, renaming and re-ordering folders 
  * Adding any type of standard dialog box to support different programs 
  * Setting desired keyboard and mouse button shortcuts for opening Folders Popup menu 
  * Supports special folders, which can be either hidden or visible 
  * Launching folders using numeric menu shortcuts 
  * Displaying the popup menu at a fixed position 
  * Compatible with all modern Windows operating systems 

**Using Folders Popup**

If you are looking for an eye-catching user interface, then Folders Popup will disappoint you at first glance. However, the interface is designed for functionality, giving only the settings area. All we saw was a list of locations that we could access.

We configured the shortcuts we wanted to use easily, and since we wanted fast access, we were glad to find that the application allowed us to use simple combinations. We could even perform a desired function by pressing a mouse button. Pressing the configured shortcut displayed the list of locations instantly.

By default, the folders launcher appears by pressing Windows+K or the middle mouse button over an Explorer window or a file dialog box. We could also access the File Explorer window from any window by pressing Shift+Windows+K. If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can also open a new Explorer window by holding shift as you press the wheel.

Folders Popup makes it easy to know the shortcuts you can use to display the list of folders. When you launch the application, it displays a note from the system tray displaying the possible shortcuts.

The application comes with default locations already configured, including program files, Windows folder and system partitions. In addition, we could define our own paths. However, we could not change the special locations in a sub-folder menu, which included Pictures, Documents, Desktop, Recycle Bin and Control Panel.

We found almost all the options we wanted to configure the application under Settings. We could even add separating objects to arrange locations based on their respective purposes.

We added the folders we used frequently by clicking the middle mouse button and selecting AAdd This FolderA and then providing a suitable name before clicking OK. The application automatically supported regular dialog boxes, and we could teach it to recognize others. The process was as simple as clicking the middle mouse button when using an unsupported dialog box and choosing AAdd this dialog to the supported listA and then clicking OK.

**Verdict**

If you want to quickly access folders, then Folders Popup is an ideal application for you. There is no learning curve, and you do not need to install it.
