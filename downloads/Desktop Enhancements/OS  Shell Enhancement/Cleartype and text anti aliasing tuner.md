**Publisher's Description**  
  


Options for text anti-aliasing ("Smooth edges of screen fonts") and ClearType are located in different places depending on Windows version. This is very annoying and confuses users much! 

Here is a small program that keeps Smooth edges and ClearType options in a same place. It is ClearType Switcher.
