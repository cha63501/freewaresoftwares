**Publisher's Description**  
  


Keep Running allows you to launch a program and/or ensure it stays running. This could be to restart a crashed application or prevent something from being closed accidentally. Also useful in a kiosk, library, school, website demo, or web-based application such as a self-registration/signup type of environment. 

Optionally you can use Keep Running as a custom shell so an application such as Internet Explorer is the only available program and to automatically re-launch it or restart the machine if closed.
