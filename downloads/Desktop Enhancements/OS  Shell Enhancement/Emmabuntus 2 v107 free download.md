One of the most common uses today of Linux distributions is to give life to
old equipment that you just canA't work with the latest operating system. This
fully affects organizations that are dedicated to recycling old computers for
use by groups that do not have access to current technology.  
  
The EmmabuntA1/4s has been built for this purpose. This lightweight
distribution, based on Xubuntu and created for use on old equipment, helps
organizations of in need people to promote the learning of new technologies.
Based on a Linux distribution and on free software, it also promotes the reuse
of existing resources and the sustainable development.  
  
EmmabuntA1/4s comes with all the benefits of Ubuntu: live-DVD mode, optional
offline installation, all software available in Ubuntu (including non-free
applications like Skype or Adobe Flash), an easy to use interface and
multilanguage support.  
  
Regardless of the purpose for which it was created, a distribution
EmmabuntA1/4s is recommended if you have an underpowered PC or want to enjoy
the benefits of Linux without worrying about technical issues.
