**Publisher's Description**  
  

Wubi is an officially supported Ubuntu installer for Windows users that can
bring you to the Linux world with a single click. Wubi allows you to install
and uninstall Ubuntu as any other Windows application, in a simple and safe
way.

**Wubi is Simple**  
No need to burn a CD. Just run the installer, enter a password for the new
account, and click "Install", go grab a coffee, and when you are back, Ubuntu
will be ready for you.

**Wubi is Safe**  
You keep Windows as it is, Wubi only adds an extra option to boot into Ubuntu.
Wubi does not require you to modify the partitions of your PC, or to use a
different bootloader, and does not install special drivers. It works just like
any other application. Wubi is spyware and malware free, and being open
source, anyone can verify that.

**Wubi is Discrete**  
Wubi keeps most of the files in one folder, and if you do not like it, you can
simply uninstall it as any other application.

**Wubi is Free**  
Wubi and Ubuntu cost absolutely nothing (free as in beer), but yet provide a
state of the art, fully functional, operating system that does not require any
activation and does not impose any restriction on its use (free as in
freedom).
