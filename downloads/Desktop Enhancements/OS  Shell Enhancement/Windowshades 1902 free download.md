**Publisher's Description**  
  

Creates a color-and-opacity configurable tinted overlay that maintains an
"above-topmost" position in the window Z-order while at the same time being
"click-through" so as to not interfere with the userA's ability to interact
with the computer.

**Features:**

  * For people with laptops this program effectively recreates the color adjustments you commonly find on desktop monitors. 
  * Very high performance (Idling CPU usage of 0% according to the task manager on my computer). 
  * Easy to adjust HSV-based color slider controls. 
  * Easy color sampling with an eye-dropper based color picker. 
  * Safety features for resetting and/or closing the program via simple keyboard shortcuts in the event that the application goes, unexpectedly/(or intentionally via options), 100% opaque. 
  * An error reporter for handling exceptions safely to avoid 100% opaque overlay situations.
