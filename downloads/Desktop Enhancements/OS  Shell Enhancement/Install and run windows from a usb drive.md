WinToUSB is a handy program that allows you to install Windows on a USB flash or hard drive and run Windows from that drive. This easy to use program provides simple instructions to install an ISO or CD/DVD image to your USB drive. Once installed, users can easily deploy Windows from the image on the USB drive. 

The program provides support for MBR and GPT disk layouts and works with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/2008/2008 R2/2012/2012 R2.

**Important:**

  * Windows XP/Vista/7/2008 (R2) does not have built-in USB 3.0 support, so Windows XP/Vista/7/2008 (R2) will have to be booted from a USB 2.0 port. 
  * Windows 7 is not completely portable. You may have activation and driver problems when booting on different computers. 
  * USB flash drives are very slow. It takes a long time to install and run Windows from a USB flash drive so itA's recommend to use a USB hard disk. 

**WhatA's new in version 1.3:**

  * Create bootable WinPE USB drive 
  * Korean language support
