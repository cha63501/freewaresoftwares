**Publisher's Description**  
  

Expi Desktop Manager is a free program that allows you to manage the
positioning of your running applications on the desktop.

The program works by dividing your screen into different zones on your desktop
to display multiple applications. The program features various templates that
you can use to create your zones, or you can create your own. Also, there are
no limits to the number of zones or screens you can create.

Expi Desktop Manager is easy to use. After selecting your template or creating
your own, simply select a zone and assign a hotkey to it. Additionally, the
program saves your zone configuration as profiles to quickly switch between
them.

As more users have large, high-resolution computer screens, Expi Desktop
Manager is the ideal solution for managing open applications in a more
efficient and productive way.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
