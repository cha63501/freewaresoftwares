Desktop Sidebar provides you with instant access to the information you most
desire by grabbing data from your PC and the Internet. The result is a dynamic
visual display you configure and control. How can you make this possible?
Choose from among a wide selection of information conduits (MS Outlook,
toolbars, newsfeeds), called A'panels.A'

Fully customizable, Desktop Sidebar allows you to dock these panels to the
edge of the screen, or arrange them anywhere on your desktop as you wish. All
panels are configurable with a number of specific options. With hundreds of
skins available on our Web site and an easy-to-use Skin Editor, you can freely
change the appearance of Desktop Sidebar to suit your tastes.

Available panels: Newsroom, Calendar, Tasks, Inbox, Notes, Performance, Mail
Checker, Clock, Messenger, Miranda IM and ICQ, Media Player, WinAmp, Volume
Control, Toolbar, Weather, and Search Bar.
