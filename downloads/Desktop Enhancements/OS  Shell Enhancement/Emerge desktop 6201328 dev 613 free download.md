**Publisher's Description**  
  

Emerge Desktop is a replacement windows "shell" (the desktop environment
normally provided by Windows Explorer) for Windows 2000 and above. In order to
replace Windows Explorer as a shell, it provides a system tray (the area that
collects the icons collected at the lower right corner in Explorer), called
emergeTray. It will also provide access to the users programs (normally
accessed with the windows "start" button) via a right-click on the desktop,
via emergeCore.

Emerge Desktop is implemented with MinGW which is an OpenSource implementation
of the GNU C compiler and utilities. Up to this point, closed source
commercial projects have mainly been used (Microsoft Visual C++, Borland
Delphi) to develop alternate shells as they use proprietary Microsoft API
features. With Microsoft releasing more detailed information about these API
calls, the MinGW win32api is now quite complete. Additionally, several web
sites on the internet have started to include documentation and code that
illustrate how to access and use these functions.

Emerge Desktop has an open API, which allows for applets to be coded with
compilers other than MinGW if someone wishes to do so.

Emerge Desktop is written in C++, primarily developed with MinGW and is
licensed as OpenSource (under the GPL). All the source is available in
Subversion at Sourceforge. Emerge Desktop can be developed using Code::Blocks,
an IDE for MinGW.

From a design point of view, Emerge Desktop applets are capable of being run
as both standalone as well as being integrated. In order for Emerge Desktop
applets to communicate with each other, emergeCore must be running. Without
emergeCore, each applet will run independently (if, for example, you wish to
use them in conjunction with another desktop shell).
