**Publisher's Description**  
  

With SevenMizer you can transform your Windows XP, MCE or Server 2003 into the
look of Windows 7. Therefore nearly 400 files with new Icons, pictures as well
as videos are modified.

This means that SevenMizer does not provide own files and change your system
files. That has the advantage that SevenMizer works with each language and no
changes of the language specifics are made.

The installer is so developed that you have completely the change which will
be modified and which not. Even if you select files, which are possibly not at
all on your system available or not compatible, the application recognizes
this and jumps over these. This ensures that the system does not become
unstable because of wrong modification.

After updates if your system data are overwritten, then a renewal of these is
possible by using an extra program that is linked by the SevenMizer. The
application examines thereby, which files are updated and re-modify only
these. This means a very fast re-modification and it is always the current
data in the Backup.

However if the result of the installation should not assure to you, you have
the possibility to get back the old system by an un-installation. If newer
files are already present in the system by updates, this is recognized by the
un-installer and only the modified files will be replaced.
