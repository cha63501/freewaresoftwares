**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ext2Fsd is an open source linux ext2/ext3 file system driver for Windows systems (NT/2K/XP/VISTA, X86/AMD64). 

Ext2fsd is very stable for normal works, with writing access enabled. The performance comes to be an issue when thereA's heavy I/O operations. 

If you really need very heave writing I/O jobs, it is strongly recommended you to create an ext2 partition as a swap between windows and linux systems.
