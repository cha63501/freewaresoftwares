**Publisher's Description**  
  

Real-time indicator of the global threat level. Just as a thermometer measures
temperature in degrees and a barometer atmospheric pressure in millibars, the
Global ThreatWatch measures the probability of users being affected by any of
the threats in circulation at any given time.

This device is a fundamental part of Panda SoftwareA's Global Malware
Observatory, and is a new concept designed to act in the same way as say,
weather forecasts or storm warnings.

Simply add Panda Panda Global ThreathWatchA's gadget for free in your Yahoo!
Widget Engine and be up-to-date on the real status of the global threat level.

Requires: [Yahoo! Widget
Engine](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_2_219_14787.html).
