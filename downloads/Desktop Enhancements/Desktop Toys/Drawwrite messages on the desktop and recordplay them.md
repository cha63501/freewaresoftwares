**Publisher's Description**  
  


Allowing you to draw or write cursive images/texts on WindowsA' desktop, thus leaving a visual message on your monitor if you have to go away for a while. Messages are fully customizable and can also be saved. In fact, the way they are displayed is also very interesting because the sequences are played chronologically such as they were held during the recording process, therefore exactly like you made them! Now you can also send sequences directly by email! 

v1.00:

  * Add a "delete" button for deleting current selected sequence directly from the application. Needed interface width optimization. 
  * brush display strongly optimized (really faster). Needed new .dtm file structure. 
  * WARNING: version v1.00 wonA't play correctly .dtm sequences recorded with v0.93! 

v1.10:

  * Add ability to play a sequence when double-clicking on it (from anywhere, e-mailer, etc..) or when dragging/dropping on application. 
  * Allowing application multiple instances (consequence of the previous feature to avoid DDE coding...). 
  * Add an "e-mail" button to attach a sequence to the default e-mailer. This button allows to type e-mail address of recipient and the current selected sequence will be attached automatically (uses MAPI). Needed interface width optimization.
