DeskFlag places an animated United States flag on your screen. The flag waves in the lower-right corner as you use your computer. 

DeskFlag was created after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and is dedicated to the memory of the victims. We hope that in some small way, using this program helps people demonstrate their condemnation of this senseless act.
