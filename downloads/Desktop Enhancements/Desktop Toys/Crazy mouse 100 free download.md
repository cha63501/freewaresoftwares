**Publisher's Description**  
  

Wanna play a small prank on your boss or mother-in-law ? Install A'Crazy
MouseA' on their PC.

When Crazy Mouse is running in the background, the mouse cursor frequently
moves around randomly and then behaves normal for sometime, before acting
crazy again. To make the mouse act normal press Control + Shift. To display
the Crazy Mouse setup window anytime, press Control + Shift + Q.

You can either set it to run at Windows Startup as a prank, or you can
normally run it and use it as a way to keep strangers from using your PC while
you are away
