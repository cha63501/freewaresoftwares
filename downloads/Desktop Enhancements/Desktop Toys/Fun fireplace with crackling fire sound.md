**Publisher's Description**  
  


Listen to the crackling fire in the fireplace as you listen to some great Christmas Music in the background. 

This is an interactive multimedia program. There are things you can move in the program, like moving the screen from in front of the fireplace, and you can move the stockings from the mantle, move the fireplace accessories, move the little Christmas tree or the wreath over the fireplace. 

You can click to start the music playing one song at a time or click on the "play all" button. You can advance to the next song. Quit any song or all songs. You can click on the fire and it will go out. Click on it again and the fire will start back up. Click on the little elves for some very funny sounds. Click on Santa for his surprising laugh. Clicking on some of the stockings will bring the elves back out, in addition to spinning and making their own sound. Drag your arrow around the page and see which sounds you can find. Remember that using the exit sign is more fun than using the X. 

Fun level: Ages 2 to 102 

Have fun with this new fun toy. As Always, Peace and Merry Christmas to all... From PlanetDenn.com.
