WinRoll easily manages the height of windows. Right click the title bar of a window to minimize its height, leaving only the title bar visible. Another right click to the same area restores the original height. The same effect can be obtained by right clicking either the minimize or the maximize button. Right clicking and pressing the Alt key changes all windows. You may also choose to "rollup" or "unroll" all visible windows from the tray icon application which is written in 100% pure assembly language. Best of all... itA's Freeware! Source code included.
