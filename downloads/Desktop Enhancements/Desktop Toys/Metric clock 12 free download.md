metric hour = 100 metric minutes, 1 metric minute = 100 metric seconds)

This is an updated version that blends perfectly into your startbar, it starts
as a tab, but only move your mouse over it and it slides out to the origianal
screen (it is this which is shown above)

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
nloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows
