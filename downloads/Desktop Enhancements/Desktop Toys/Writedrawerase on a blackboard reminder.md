**Publisher's Description**  
  


Ardoise (blackboard) allows you to write/draw/erase everything (useful reminder). At launch (and at start of Windows) the program displays a transparent small version of your blackboard status "Hide mode" and in "Draw mode" you may use your blackboard like a real one, using chalks to draw/write and a sponge to erase! Includes a powerful automatic self-update mechanism when new versions are available. 

**What's New in version 1.13:**

  * "About" content updated for 1.13 
  * Interface design XP/Vista compliant (better looking!) 
  * FTP sync system now also memorizing current Ardoise number (day of week) 
  * FTP user connection parameters encryption 
  * Fixes text mistakes during FTP transfer 

WARNING: As Ardoise FTP has been hacked during 2 weeks this summer, I have changed connections parameters and as a logical result, self-update mechanism won't work anymore for all versions earlier than 1.13.
