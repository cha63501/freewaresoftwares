**Publisher's Description**  
  

This utility allows you to "pin" a window to the top of all other windows. The
idea for this tool arose when I had to do a documentation for some program.
Instead of repeatedly switching from one window to the other I thought it
helpful to have my word processor staying in front of the other one...

When the program is running an icon appears in the Taskbar Notification Area,
next to the time display in the lower right corner of the screen.

By clicking the icon, a menu appears where all currently open windows are
listed. Click the window you would like to have set as top most window (i.e.
all other windows lie below this window. To remove "top most" from a window
again, just select the window in the menu another time!
