If you like to stuff blinking lights, elfs or Christmas trees into and around
your house as soon as the Christmas season nears you might also like the
desktop Christmas tree.

The Christmas tree requires no installation and can be executed after
unpacking them on the computer. They are always on top by default and can be
moved freely around on the computer desktop.
