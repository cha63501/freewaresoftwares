**Publisher's Description**  
  


Floppy Madness is a small program that will try and access the floppy drive at user specified intervals. If this does not seem fun, just download it and see. By default it will launch hidden and access the A: drive every minute. But users can access the setup information where they can change the interval of access, length of access, and even display a user defined error message! Floppy Madness will drive people crazy as it grinds the floppy drive every minute. To close simply move your mouse cursor to the TOP LEFT corner of the screen.
