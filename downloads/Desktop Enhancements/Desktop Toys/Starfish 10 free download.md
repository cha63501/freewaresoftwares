**Publisher's Description**  
  

This is a little screen toy. The starfish always looks to the mouse pointer.
ItA's behaviour can be switched between curious and scared by pressing the
space bar. Any other keystroke will end the Starfish program. Of course the
Starfish will only respond to the keyboard when it is activated. This means
you have to click on the Starfish button in the taskbar if necessary. Have
even more fun with numerous Starfishes by starting the program several times!
