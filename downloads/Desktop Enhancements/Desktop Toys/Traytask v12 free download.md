Tray Task allows you to remove any program from the Windows taskbar and store
it under a popup menu on the TrayTask tray icon. The application is then
accessed via the TrayTask right-click menu.

Why would you want this? Sometimes you have a program running and you want to
make sure other users on the compute donA't close it. Or perhaps the
application canA't minimize to the windows tray. This is a great way to clear
up toolbar clutter.

What happens if I close TrayTask while programs are hidden? They window is
automatically restored to your Windows taskbar.

No installation required, Single executable, Simple, easy, free.
