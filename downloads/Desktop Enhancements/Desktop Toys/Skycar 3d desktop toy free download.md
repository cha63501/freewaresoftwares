**Publisher's Description**  
  

Created by Moller International, the M400 Skycar aircraft is a four-person
Vertical Takeoff and Landing Vehicle (VTOL) currently undergoing initial
flight-testing. The million dollar price tag is a bit rich for most of us so
we suggest you try our YummyWorks desktop version!

The M400 Skycar is a 3D interactive desktop toy that you fly on your desktop.

  * Full scale replica of the actual model 
  * 360 degree explore mode 
  * Operable doors, landing gear, folding wings and engines 
  * Will hover and fly on your desktop
