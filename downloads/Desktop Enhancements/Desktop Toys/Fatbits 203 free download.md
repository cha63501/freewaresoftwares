Fatbits is a very fast, compact, easy to use and versatile FREEWARE (for non-
commercial use) screen magnifier for Windows 9x/ME/NT4/2000/XP/2003.

Fatbits is one of those mind bogglingly useful utility programs for graphic
artists or people designing user interfaces. It magnifies an area of the

see something right down to the last pixel.

Fatbits is also useful as an accessibility tool. It can perform text smoothing
(click here for an example) and can modify the colors it displays to help
those with color vision deficiency.
