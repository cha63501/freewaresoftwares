**Publisher's Description**  
  

Binary Toys presents a collection of interactive windowless virtual toys made
up of springs, muscles, and masses.

Easily manipulate your virtual toy by grabbing a node to move your virtual toy
around or drop it on top of a window. Right-click to access a pop-up menu with
additional options.

Originally created by Soda, based on simple physics, these toys exhibit
complex behavior and are surprisingly life-like. Major fun.

Press **T** on your keyboard to toggle transparency, **S** to change size,
**M** to show toy muscles, **U** to untangle, **R** to reverse direction, or
press **SPACE** to pause/restart toy movement.

No installation necessary, just download and run.
