BrineSoft Mr Hyde - the small utility that you missed so badly.

previous state and it is possible to continue seamlessly in work.

Mr Hyde can be started automatically with Windows. No shortcut on your
Desktop, no shortcut in the Windows Start Menu, no shortcut in the Startup
folder. No icon in the System Tray. Very little footprint in the system. Mr
Hyde is discreete.
