**Publisher's Description**  
  


The basic purpose of AniTuner is to create, edit and convert Windows animated cursors (.ani files). 

AniTuner makes the creation and edition of these animated cursors easy: everyone can create his/her own animated cursors in a snap. You can use animated cursors not only to customize the appearance of Windows (desktop themes) but also to produce animations for your Web pages, e-mails, documents, manuals or even applications.

**Features:**

  * open and display any animated cursor. 
  * convert animated GIF and AVI into animated cursors (ANI). 
  * import existing image files (BMP, GIF, PNG, PSD, ICO, CUR...) to turn them into cursors or animated cursors. 
  * export frames from your animated cursors to several image formats. 
  * modify existing animated cursors and change their color depth or size. 
  * convert animated cursors into animated GIF, AVI, static bitmaps or even Macromedia Flash SWF movies. 
  * edit frames, change their duration, modify them in your favorite image editor and save changes back to the animated cursor. 
  * AniTuner handles all cursor sizes (not only 32x32) & color depths (from 1bpp to 32bpp). 
  * special support for 32-bit cursors with a 8-bit alpha channel (partial transparency for Windows 2000/XP). 
  * turn your old 16 or 256-color animated cursors into 32-bit animated cursors with a semi-transparent shadow for Windows XP. 
  * export (and import) animated cursors as a series of PNG files (with alpha channel optionally) for easy editing. 
  * create animated GIFs, small Flash movies using the Frame editor and the Import/Export functions. 
  * browse for animated cursors on your computer and easily preview them.
