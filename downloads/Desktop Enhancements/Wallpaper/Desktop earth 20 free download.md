**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Earth is probably the best planet IA've ever been to, so I like to keep
abreast of whatA's going on in the world. I found this desktop background
great for monitoring cloud cover, the advance of day and night and nocturnal
lights around the globe.

Although the cloud cover only renews itself every 3 hours, you might be able
to find a server faster than those built into the Desktop Earth and apply this
for quicker generation. The illuminated surface of the Earth updates every
minute though, so itA's great for finding out where the Sun is concentrated at
any given moment. I would have liked to have seen a few more options, such as
the ability to rotate the image on your desktop, but on the whole Desktop
Earth provides a decent solar clock, a rudimentary weather chart and, more
importantly, a stunning view from your desktop.

There is no limit on the resolution, and the imagery is calculated from high-
resolution 2560x1280 textures, so you can go wild with it even on 30" flat
panel displays. Multi-monitor configurations are also supported.
