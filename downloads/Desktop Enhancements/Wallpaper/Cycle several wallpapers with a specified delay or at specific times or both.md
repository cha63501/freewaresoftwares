Wallpaper Cycler Lite is the free lite version of Wallpaper Cycler which is an easy to use, yet powerful desktop wallpaper manager/changer to get rid of that boring static wallpaper on your desktop. You can change the wallpaper with a specific delay or at specific times or both. Wallpapers are easily managed in multi-level categories which can have time constraints.

A lot of attention has been given to the performance of Wallpaper Cycler. As a result, Wallpaper Cycler allows you to manage tens of thousands of wallpapers without slowing down. 

An advanced random selection algorithm is included to ensure that all wallpapers are randomly chosen before a wallpaper appears again.

Wallpaper Cycler has three types of wallpapers: image, gradient and URL. URL wallpapers allow you to add webcams to your desktop. A lot of image formats are supported, such as JPG, JPE, BMP, DIB, RLE, TIF, PNG, TGA, ICB, VDA, VST, JP2 (JPEG2000), JPC, PCX, DCX, PNM, PGM, PBM, PPM, RAS, ICO, ANI, EMF, WMF and GIF.
