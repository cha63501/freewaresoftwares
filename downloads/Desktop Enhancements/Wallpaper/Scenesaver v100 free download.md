SceneSaver is a complimentary screen saver of twenty-two high resolution
photographs of some of the best nature has to offer our world. Each of the
twenty-two images comprises an astonishingly beautiful scene taken of the
outdoors. From OregonA's Painted Hills National Park to Big Sur, California,
each image is breathtakingly beautiful and relaxing to view.

When you tire of SceneSaverA's included images use your own! Tell SceneSaver
which folder contains the images you wish to use and SceneSaver handles the
rest. You can even include all the sub-folders of a specific folder! This is
perfect when you have thousands of images. SceneSaver will randomly choose
from your collection and display the image as wallpaper or as a screen saver
for any duration you specify. This is a great way to start seeing photos you
havenA't seen in a long time! Its fun --even addictive-- to watch which photo
is chosen next!
