**Publisher's Description**  
  

WALL32 is a self-contained, real-time wallpaper generator, which simulates the
EarthA's and MoonA's illumination by the sun. The Earth view includes twilight
zones and the Moon view takes the earthshine (Da VinciA's Glow) into account.

WALL32 consists of single EXE-file and runs in background. It reads the clock
and timezone information of your PC and calculates the real-time illumination
(every 5 minutes for the earth and every 30 minutes for the moon wallpaper).

wallpaper.
