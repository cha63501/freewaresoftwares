**Publisher's Description**  
  


DeskSlide is a utility for automating the wallpaper change on your desktop. It replaces your boring desktop wallpaper, also called background image, automatically at intervals of your choice, with your beautiful digital images. 

You can specify the wallpaper change interval in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weekly, monthly or when you log on - just to name a few. You can define complicated schedules as well.

Try using the photographs made by your digital camera as your desktop wallpaper. It wouldnA't fit, would it? Windows does not scale down your image size for you. DeskSlide does not only scale-up or scale-down for you, it gives you different options.

You can rearrange the order of the slides, specifying the style or layout, or let DeskSlide automatically select this for you, depending on the image. Supported file types are BMP, GIF, JPEG, DIB, and PNG.
