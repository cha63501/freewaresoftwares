**Publisher's Description**  
  

Wallperizer is a desktop wallpaper changer. Once you install it, the program
only asks you one directory from where to use pictures as desktop wallpaper.
After this, the program will be accessible from the system tray menu.

You can add up to 100 directories where the program would look for pictures
which would be used as wallpapers.

The wallpaper can be changed automatically, either in order or randomly.

Brightness normalization is an automatic process where bright pictures are
made darker and dark pictures are made brighter, which can be used to bring
the brightness of wallpapers close the to environmental light.

A calendar can be displayed on the wallpaper. Calendars have skins. You can
edit, load and save calendar skins.
