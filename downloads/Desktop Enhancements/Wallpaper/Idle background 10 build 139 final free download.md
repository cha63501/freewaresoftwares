**Publisher's Description**  
  

Idle Background is a new software program that will change your desktop
background to specific images listed on the main window. The images are picked
out of the list every minute (or whatever time your specify) and are changed
and set to either Tile, Centre or Stretch. The program will keep looping
through the list until you stop the program. Previews of the wallpapers you
wish to use are available and extra tools to ensure that everything runs
smoothly.

Idle background will sit in the system tray while its running, ensuring that
it does not clutter your desktop. You can save your images used as lists,
which means that you can have several lists of wallpapers to use, allowing you
to switch whenever you get bored of your current wallpapers.
