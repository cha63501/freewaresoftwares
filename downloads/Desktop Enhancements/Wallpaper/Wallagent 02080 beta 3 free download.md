WallAgent is a tool which changes your desktop wallpaper automatically like a
slideshow (desktop changer).

locally. If you donA't like managing things by yourself, then you can select
auto mode, which means that WallAgent will select a category and download at
random quality wallpapers for your desktop.

If you own a pet and have its photos, select them in WallAgent and your
desktop will look more alive. In addition to all of this, WallAgent is also
very customizable.
