**Publisher's Description**  
  

"Lotus Pond" is a colorful animated wallpaper. Droplets of drizzling rain are
creating tiny waves in the crystal clean water. Grasses at the pond side are
waving gently in the breezes. Green Lotus leaves will not only please your
eyes but also help release eye-stresses. Mercury like silver water droplets
are gently rolling over the lotus leaves. Happily roaming around in the pond
are the cute little fishes some times being curiously examined by butterflies
flying restlessly over the surface of the water or the waving grasses. The
lotus pond is lively, charming, and beautiful.

Last but not least, enjoy the soothing and relaxing background music with
calming natural beauty, releive yourself from work and stress for a while.
DonA't you want to hear some chirping of birds also with such a stage setting?
