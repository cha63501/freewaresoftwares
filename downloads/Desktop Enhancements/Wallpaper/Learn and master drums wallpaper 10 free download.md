**Publisher's Description**  
  

Learn and Master Drums wallpaper. From the tribes of Ghana, West Africa, the
traditional Kpanlogo drum is associated with Kpanlogo music and dance of the
Ga and Ewe tribes. The Kpanlogo is a member of the membranophone, or drum-head
covered shell or vibrating stretched membrane, family of musical instruments.

In the 1960A's rock band drummers began to change this, by expanding it. An
extra bass drum, more symbols - people had gotten skilled enough to require
more thing to play with. Electric drums were created, and it is arguable that
this is where modern synthesized drum beats used in songs originated from.

WhatA's next for the drum? Who knows. Maybe itA's time to start adding more.
After all, the sky is the limit. Famous drummers are rather well recognized.
Ringo Star, Neil Peart, John Bonham all belonged to famous bands and are now
recognized as legends. Some have great drum solos which are also recognizable.

My favourite drummer? Chad Smith from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But itA's not
my opinion that mattters - the greatest drummer of all time according to polls
is Neil Peart. His drumming is unbelievably fast, and he is rhythmically
strong. HeA's maybe not as strong with the beat as John Bonham but is he is
faster. The strange thing is that Neil Peart was inspired by 2 people - Keith
Moon - and John Bonham.
