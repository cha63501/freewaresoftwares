**Publisher's Description**  
  

Learn and Master Guitar wallpaper. So you want a guitar, and you are finally
going to go out and try and find one. If youA're on a budget then you might
think that your buying options are limited. The truth is that you can probably
find a better deal on discontinued models that have barely been used. There
are a lot of these items laying around waiting to be sold either because the
original owner upgraded, became disinterested, or just changed models.

Natural harmonics happen at the spaces along the string where the "wave" stops
and starts a new one. (Not technically correct but makes sense to me this
way). This normally happens just above the 5th fret, the 7th fret, and the
12th fret wires. If you take a minute in a well lit room you can see the spots
where the vibration along the string actually seems to be stopped. When you
lightly touch a ringing string on these points you will get a natural harmonic
chime.
