ALTools Saint Patricks Day Desktop Wallpapers 2006 displays on your screen pictures with leprechauns. St. PatrickA's Day is time to decorate your PC with pots of gold and rainbows, leprechauns and magic toadstools, shamrocks and shillelaghs, and green beer too. And you can put a little bit of Eire on your desktop with the ALTools St. PatrickA's Day Desktop Wallpapers. 

This year our ALTools Egghead Leprechaun friend takes you on a private tour of some special places and his most prized posessions. Starting with his pot of gold, he meanders through his fairy ring of magic toadstools and finally winds up his tour with his greatest treasure...

The first St. PatrickA's Day desktop wallpaper features and ALTools Leprechaun guarding his pot of gold and green beer with his mighty shillelagh. If you catch him, you might just get his pot of gold, but we wouldnA't advise touching his beverage...

The second St. PatrickA's day desktop wallpaper shows our leprechaun friend atop a magic toadstool in the fairy ring heA's planted. Toadstools may be fine food for fairy-folk, but we donA't advise eating them for big people.

The last St. PatrickA's Day desktop wallpaper has our wee-folk friend amidst a green beer forest! Huge magical glasses of eternally full green beer surround our leprechaun friend as his greatest treasure. And with the conclusion of our magical tour, our wee-folk friend has just one thing to say, "Tabhair pog dom, is Eireannach me!"

But heA'll only show you these special places for St. PatrickA's Day though, so make sure to download him today.

These fun desktops will keep you in the holiday spirit with 3 brightly colored high-quality desktop wallpapers. Multiple resolutions for each wallpaper ensure they fit any monitor perfectly, all the way up to 30" Cinema Displays at 2560x1600!

The ALTools St. PatrickA's Day desktop wallpapers are brought to you by ESTsoft, the same people who brought you ALZip, ALShow, ALSong, ALSee, ALFTP, and ALPass.

Oh yeah... And one last thing...

Eireann go Brach!
