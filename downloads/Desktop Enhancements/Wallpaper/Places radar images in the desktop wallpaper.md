**Publisher's Description**  
  


The program is designed to obtain an image from a website (typically radar but could be just about any image) and then applies that image to your desktop. You can have up to fifty different images displayed on the desktop. The program has a user definable timer so the image can be updated as often as you would like. 

The image is actually embedded into the desktop wallpaper so it will always be below all other windows on your screen. The modified image (with the radar picture) does not affect your actual desktop wallpaper file and windows will restore the original wallpaper when you exit the program.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)

Updated to V1.2.0 to add ability to launch the program when Windows starts.  
  
Updated to V1.2.1 to resolve bug when Windows shuts down and the radar program stops it from doing so.
