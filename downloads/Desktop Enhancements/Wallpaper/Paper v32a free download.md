**Publisher's Description**  
  

Paper is a utility to change the wallpaper randomly on start-up of Windows
9x/ME/2K/NT. Paper will accept both bitmaps and JPEGA's. You may drop multiple
files, and the program will automatically block out anything that does not
have a .BMP or .JPG/.JPEG extension. Also, if a file is already in the list it
will not add it a second time.
