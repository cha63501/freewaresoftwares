**About:**

After switching to WindowA's new OS Vista, I went in search of a good
Wallpaper changer. I could not find one, so I decided to create my own.

This wallpaper changer will monitor your chosen folder and recognize when new
pictures are added or old pictures are removed. It will also recursively drill
down through each subsequent folder checking for images. You can also set how
often it rotates the images from 1 minute to multiple days.

Other feature include setting program to start with windows and a progress bar
to show when the next wallpaper change will take place. Also has ability to
determine imageA's main color, and set desktop background color to match.

**Version Updates:**

  * v1.0 Added ability to change image folder location after initial declaration 
  * v1.5 Added easy installation wizard, improved visual appearance 
  * v2.0 Added Experimental Auto-Desktop Color Chooser, removed various bugs 
  * v2.2 Fixed tile/center/zoom control 
  * v2.3 Added filename in image, still buggy but can be disabled
