**Publisher's Description**  
  

Font Compare is a handy little utility that allows one to compare three true-
type fonts at a time and to easily see whether a font contains all the numbers
and punctuation, as well as the international characters needed for writing
French. The fonts must be already installed on the system. A necessity for
anyone who wants to thoroughly examine a font before using it in the document.
