**Publisher's Description**  
  


Batch Font Renamer - Give each font a name that speaks for itself with one click! Got a font collection? Got a collection, but no order in it? Start by giving font files the names corresponding to the full font names. 

Easily. Select a folder with fonts and click the Rename button. ThatA's all. The program itself will find out which font each file contains and give it the corresponding name.

Processing subfolders. Suppose you have a large collection of fonts with a lot of folders in it. Just select the parent folder containing all subfolders and specify that the program should process subfolders. 

Names without spaces. You can remove all spaces from names if you need it for some reasons. All fonts in the Windows fonts folder will be ignored.

Characters that cannot be used in file names will be replaced with spaces or removed. For example, AA<<:AA>>, AA<>, AA<>. In case double spaces emerge, they will be replaced with single ones.

Free Font Renamer is absolutely free and even if you have burned your collection to a CD, it makes sense to copy it to your hard disk, rename all font files and record it again on a CD. Do not forget to recommend the program to your friends.
