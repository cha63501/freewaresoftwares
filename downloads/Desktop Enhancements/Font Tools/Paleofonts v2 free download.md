**Publisher's Description**  
  

"Paleofonts V. 2" is an *exe file of c. 17 Mb which is unpacked by default in
a separate folder, of c. 38 Mb, from where it can be installed into
"Windows"A's "Fonts" folder. With additional software and separate procedures,
the True Tupe Fonts may work under some "Linux" distributions. The compilation
contains 279 paleographic True Type Files plus a brief *pdf document entitled
"Explanation", providing some technical and legal statements. The fonts are
designed by various authors, whose intellectual property they represent. The
credit for the creation of these fonts is all theirs. All of the fonts are
free for personal as well as academic use, but not for commercial purposes

The fonts embody dozens of ancient scripts that have been (and in some
instances few of them are still being used) for millennia around the
Mediterranean sea, as well as Northern, Central and Eastern parts of Europe,
ancient Egypt and Near and Middle East. Some of these scripts are scarcely
represented in this version, rarely with more than one font, but many, among
them various variants of Egyptian hieroglyphs Hebrew, Greek, Latin as well as
OCS Cyrillic are quite extensively represented.
