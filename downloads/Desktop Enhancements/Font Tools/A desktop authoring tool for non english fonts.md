**Publisher's Description**  
  


Lipikar is a desktop authoring tool for non-English languages. It has been designed primarily for users of non-English or foreign fonts on WindowsA.

Through its unique interface, Lipikar strives to take away the grind of remembering which character of a particular font corresponds to which key (or keys) on the keyboard, thus making foreign language text-entry a simple task for novices and power-users alike.

  * **A mouse-hover sensitive zoom window**   
See any character/letter clearly before using it 
  

  * **Complete character layout with mouse input feature**  
No need to remember Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Key combinations 
  

  * **Font-based text search**  
Search your text with the font it was written with 
  

  * **Text save to / load from**  
Save your work now to load it later if you are short of time 
  

  * **FontBrowser**  
Browse through previews of all the installed fonts 
  

  * **Custom FontMap Editor**  
Create/save/load your own layout of FontMap by picking only the letters you need and arranging them around 
  

  * **Keyboard Map Viewer**  
Find out which key on your keyboard is mapped to which character of any font
