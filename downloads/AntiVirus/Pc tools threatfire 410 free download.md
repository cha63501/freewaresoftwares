**Publisher's Description**  
  

ThreatFire Free Edition is an application designed to protect your computer
against malware such as trojans, spyware, rootkits, keyloggers, and buffer
overflows by intelligently detecting and blocking behavior consistent with
that of malware.

ThreatFire uses advanced patent-pending technology to detect signs of
malicious behavior commonly used by malware threats. ThreatFire is unlike
traditional antivirus products that rely on old fashioned "signature"
technology and require updating every time a new threat occurs.

By constantly monitoring the activity on your PC ThreatFireAs ActiveDefense
technology is able to hunt down and paralyze threats that are too new or too
clever to be recognized by traditional security software.

ThreatFire employs an intelligent behavioral engine to only alert you on truly
malicious behavior, because sometimes even legitimate software may look
malicious. This means you are only alerted when you really need to be.
