**Publisher's Description**  
  

Look2Me Remover (also known as L2MRemover) is very easy to use since itA's
very similar to ETRemover (also known as EliteToolbar Remover) which is the
SimplyTech.it generic anti-malware solution.

Look2Me Remover runs in Windows 2000/Windows XP only and it could be perfectly
used in Normal Mode and needs two imputs by you to work:

  1. Firstly: press the "Scan" button and let it searching any occurrences in your System, Memory and Registry. If it will found a known variant of the malware it will detect it, make it innocue by injecting our code in the malware while it is running, then it will list the Registry keys wich load the malware at each restart of the System. 
  2. The second thing to do is pressing the "Delete Keys" button to cleaning the Registry from the keys wich cause the infestations to run on the reboot. 

If you feel unsure about the remotion of the Registry keys you can also check
the "Save before delete" box so a backup file *.reg will be saved just in case
you would to rebuild the deleted keys.

Please keep in mind that "Look2Me Remover" doesnA't remove the previous
variant of the Look2Me malware, since we started studying the variant wich is
out only from November 2005 we would advise you that this program works for
the versions of the malware that go onward from that date.

**Required files:**  
The L2MDFN.DAT file is the file wich contains the malware definitions. It is
necessary that this file is put in the same directory where L2MRemover has
been installed.
