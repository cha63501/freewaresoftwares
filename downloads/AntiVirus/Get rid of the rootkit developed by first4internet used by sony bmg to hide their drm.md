**Publisher's Description**  
  


Lavasoft ARIES Rootkit Remover will get rid of the rootkit developed by First4Internet used by Sony BMG to hide their DRM (Digital Rights Management) software. 

During Autumn 2005, Sony included rootkit-style content-protection software on approximately 4.7 million CDs of over 50 artists worldwide exposing consumer PCs to security holes. The XCP rootkit, developed by First4Internet, was inadvertently placed on unsuspecting systems and networks to hide Sony BMGAs DRM protection software. According to Sony, about six million CDs currently have this software on December 2005.
