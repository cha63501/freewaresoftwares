**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool checks Windows computers
for and helps remove infections by specific, prevalent malicious
softwareAincluding Blaster, Sasser, and Mydoom. When the detection and removal
process is complete, the tool displays a report describing the outcome,
including which, if any, malicious software was detected and removed. The tool
creates a log file named mrt.log in the %WINDIR%debug folder.

This tool will help to remove specific, prevalent malicious software from
infected systems. Because computers can appear to function normally when
infected, Microsoft advises you to run this tool even if your computer seems
to be fine. In addition to using this tool, you should use an up-to-date
antivirus product to help protect your computer from other malicious software.

This tool is not a replacement for an anti-virus product. To help protect your
computer, you should use an anti-virus product.
