Sophos Anti-Rootkit finds and removes any rootkit that is hidden on your computer. 

As part of its complete protection of endpoint computers, Sophos Anti-Virus detects rootkits and prevents them being installed on any of your desktops, laptops and servers.

Sophos Anti-Rootkit provides an extra layer of detection, by safely and reliably detecting and removing any rootkit that might already have secreted itself onto your system. 

Using Sophos Anti-Rootkit is straightforward. Whether you use its simple graphical user interface or run it from the command line you can easily detect and eliminate any rootkits on your computer.

**Features:**

  * Scans running processes, windows registry and local hard drives for rootkits. 
  * Identifies known rootkits and selects, by default, files for removal which will remove the rootkit component of the malware without compromising OS integrity. 
  * Allows users to remove unidentified hidden files, but does not allow removal of essential system files when hidden by an identified rootkit. 
  * Once the user has run a scan, the screen prompts the user through the necessary steps until every rootkit has been removed. 
  * Users can switch between the GUI and command-line functionality. 
  * Both context sensitive and command-line help are available.
