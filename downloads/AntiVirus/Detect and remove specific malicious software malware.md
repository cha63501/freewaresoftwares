Norman Malware Cleaner is a Norman program utility that may be used to detect and remove specific malicious software (malware).

It will clean an infected system completely:

  * kill running processes that are infected 
  * reveal and remove rootkits 
  * remove infections from disk (including ActiveX components and browser helper objects) 
  * restore correct registry values 
  * remove references created by malware in hosts file 
  * remove windows firewall rules for malicious programs
