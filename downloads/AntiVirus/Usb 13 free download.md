**Publisher's Description**  
  

USB is designed for prevention of infecting computers by autorun viruses. The
program is loaded into system memory and when new removable device attachment
occurs, the program automatically renames autorun.inf files on new device into
autorun.inf_current date_time, and set the attribute to "normal", making it
visible for system. As a result it prevents infection.

This program is freeware and can be used under principle "as-is".

**Features:**

  * Small size and low system resources consumption. 
  * Ability to make ANY work with attached device at moment of attachment using command file, defined by user. 
  * Wide settings abilities (included ability to run ad domain). 

**WhatA's New in version 1.3:**

  * Added ability to change autorun status in system (now it is option, selected by user). 
  * Solved problem. Now program can get itA's autorun status from registry correctly.
