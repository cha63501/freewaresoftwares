**Publisher's Description**  
  

Roboscan Internet Security Free is a fast, light, and free anti-virus program.

**Advantages of using Roboscan Internet Security**

1\. Multi-layered protection with award-winning dual engines  
Roboscan uses two award-winning engines, the BitDefender Engine and
RoboscanA's Tera Engine, to defend your computer. These two layers of
protection identify and block malware(such as spyware, trojans, adware, worm,
viruses and so on) and hacking tools.

2\. Increase Scan Speed with Smart Scan Technology  
RoboscanA's Smart Scan technology keeps your scan process fast and efficient.
When Roboscan scans your computer, it stores a record of safe files in an
internal WhiteList database which it uses for reference in future scans. This
WhiteList database is updated after each scan, reducing the time it takes to
complete each successive scan.

3\. Prevents normal files from being detected as a virus  
Roboscan prevents any normal file from being detected as a virus by using a
unique false positive recognition system.
