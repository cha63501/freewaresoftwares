**Publisher's Description**  
  

Trend Micro RUBotted (Beta) is a small program that runs on your computer,
watching for bot related activities. RUBotted intelligently monitors your
computerA's system behavior for activities that are potentially harmful to
both your computer and other peopleA's computers. RUBotted monitors for remote
command and control (C&C) commands sent from a bot-herder to control your
computer. Additionally, RUBotted watches for an array of potentially malicious
bot-related activities, including mass mailing - a common activity performed
by a bot-infected computer.

RUBotted co-exists with your existing AV software, providing advanced bot
specific behavior monitoring. RUBotted does not rely on frequent, network
intensive updates to ensure your computerA's continued protection.

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows 2000 Professional (Latest Service Pack Installed) 
  * Windows XP Professional or Home Edition (Latest Service Pack Installed) 
  * Windows 2003 Server (Latest Service Pack Installed)
