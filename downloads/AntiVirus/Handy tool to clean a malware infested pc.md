**Publisher's Description**  
  


This useful utility comes in handy when you need to clean a friendA's PC (or your own) from a malware infested state. It is specially useful for detecting and disinfecting malware infections which give regular AV products running within Windows a hard time. 

**Features:**

  * Automatic detection and removal of all types of malware. 
  * Boot from CD or USB stick. 
  * Supports using updated signature files. 
  * Supports 13 languages. 
  * Supports both FAT and NTFS drives. 

The download consists of an ISO. You can either burn this into a CD/DVD or alternatively create a more convenient Boot USB stick by using something like the **[Universal Netboot Installer (UNetbootin)**](http://www.freewarefiles.com/UNetbootin_program_49146.html). 

In order to use a more updated signature database, the Panda SafeCD searches the registry for installed Panda applications that use the regular pav.sig file signature format. If you want Panda SafeCD to use a more updated signature file simply make sure there is an installed Panda product (normally in C:\Program Files\Panda Security) with an updated pav.sig file. If the Panda SafeCD finds a more recent pav.sig than the one included in the ISO, it will use the more updated one.

For a more recently updated signature database file **[download pav.sig**](http://research.pandasecurity.com/blogs/images/pav.zip) from this blog. Remember this signature file is for tests only and updated on a "whenever-I-feel-like-it" basis, so it should not be used for production systems. For critical situations and to disinfect production systems use our regular signature file which gets updated at least once a day.

**What's New in version 4.4.3.0:**

  * New graphical user interface 
  * Update signature file from Internet, beta sig or from local PC 
  * Ability to choose individual partitions for scans
