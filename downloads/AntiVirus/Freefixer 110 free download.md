**Publisher's Description**  
  

FreeFixer is a general purpose removal tool which will help you to delete
potentially unwanted software, such as adware, spyware, trojans, viruses and
worms.

FreeFixer works by scanning a large number of locations where unwanted
software has a known record of appearing or leaving traces. The scan locations
include the programs that run on your computer, the programs that starts when
you reboot your computer, your browserA's plug-ins, your home page setting,
etc.

FreeFixer does not know what is unwanted, so it presents the scan result and
itA's up to you decide if some file should be removed and if some settings
should restored to their default value. Please be careful! If you delete a
legitimate file you may damage your computer.

To assist you when determining if anything should be removed you can find more
information at FreeFixerA's web site for each item in the scan result. You can
for example see what other users chose to do in the same situation.

You can also save log file of your scan result and consult the volunteers in
one of the [FreeFixer helper
forums](http://www.freefixer.com/manual.html#helperforums).
