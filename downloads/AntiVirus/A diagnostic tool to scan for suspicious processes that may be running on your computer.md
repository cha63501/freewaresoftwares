**Publisher's Description**  
  


MHX First Defense is a diagnostic tool to scan for suspicious processes that run on your computer. Many forms of malware, spyware, and viruses download files that can potentially harm your computer. 

MHX First Defense scans your running processes for them, shuts them down, and deletes them. However, some popular free software comes bundled with suspicious processes so MHX First Defense allow the user to add them to the ignore list, so they may continue to rid their computer of viruses while still enjoying their software. 

Also included is live help via integrated chat program to give users instant help when they encounter a problem on their computer, or wish to receive new updates. Most virus and antispyware programs will not catch all the dangers threatening a computer, but MHX First Defense gives the user full control of their computing experience. 

Plus, it is designed to be resource friendly, so users can know they are protected but still have good computer performance.

Version 2.7 updates include: Updated Server IP address, Bug fixes on shut down, updated antivirus and blacklist databases, and audio notifications to live help.
