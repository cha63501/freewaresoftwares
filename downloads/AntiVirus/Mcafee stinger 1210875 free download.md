**Publisher's Description**  
  

McAfee AVERT Stinger is a stand-alone utility used to detect and remove
specific viruses. It is not a substitute for full anti-virus protection, but
rather a tool to assist administrators and users when dealing with an infected
system. Stinger utilizes next generation scan engine technology, including
process scanning, digitally signed DAT files, and scan performance
optimizations.

**Windows ME/XP/Vista users:**

**Disabling System Restore**  
Windows utilizes a restore utility that backs up selected files automatically
to the C:_Restore folder. This means that an infected file could be stored
there as a backup file, and VirusScan will be unable to delete these files.
You must disable the System Restore Utility to remove the infected files from
the C:_Restore folder.
