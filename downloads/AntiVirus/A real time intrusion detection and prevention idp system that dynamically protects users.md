AntiHook is a real-time Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) system that dynamically protects users from malicious software such as unseen viruses, Spyware, Rootkits, Keyloggers, Code Injection, and Trojans.

AntiHook ensures the integrity of the operating system by blocking and reporting any suspicious activity, including the following: Launching of malicious applications and processes, Termination of critical security applications (e.g. Firewall, Anti-Virus), Loading of suspicious DLLs (e.g. BHOs, ActiveX), Malware modifying the memory space of an external application and executing malicious code, Kernel Rootkits that maliciously alter the Windows operating system, Registration of programs for loading on PC start-up or when the user logs on to the system, Malicious System-wide Windows hooks.
