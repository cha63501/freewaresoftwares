The AVG Rescue CD is essentially a portable version of AVG Anti-Virus supplied through Linux distribution. It can be used in the form of a bootable CD or bootable USB flash drive to recover your computer when the system cannot be loaded normally, such as after an extensive or deep-rooted virus infection. In short, the AVG Rescue CD enables you to fully remove infections from an otherwise inoperable PC and render the system bootable again.

Apart from the usual AVG functions (malware detection and removal, updates from internet or external device, etc.), the AVG Rescue CD also contains the following set of administration tools:

  * Midnight Commander - a two-panel file manager 
  * Windows Registry Editor - simple registry editor for more experienced users 
  * TestDisk - powerful hard drive recovery tool 
  * Ping - tests the availability of network resources (servers, domains, IP addresses) 
  * Common Linux programs and services - vi text editor, OpenSSH daemon, ntfsprogs etc. 

**Note:** This download is an .iso file that needs to be burned to CD/DVD. Once burned to CD/DVD, users must boot their PC from CD/DVD drive.
