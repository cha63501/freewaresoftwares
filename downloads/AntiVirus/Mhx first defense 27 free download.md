**Publisher's Description**  
  

MHX First Defense is a diagnostic tool to scan for suspicious processes that
run on your computer. Many forms of malware, spyware, and viruses download
files that can potentially harm your computer.

MHX First Defense scans your running processes for them, shuts them down, and
deletes them. However, some popular free software comes bundled with
suspicious processes so MHX First Defense allow the user to add them to the
ignore list, so they may continue to rid their computer of viruses while still
enjoying their software.

Also included is live help via integrated chat program to give users instant
help when they encounter a problem on their computer, or wish to receive new
updates. Most virus and antispyware programs will not catch all the dangers
threatening a computer, but MHX First Defense gives the user full control of
their computing experience.

Plus, it is designed to be resource friendly, so users can know they are
protected but still have good computer performance.

Version 2.7 updates include: Updated Server IP address, Bug fixes on shut
down, updated antivirus and blacklist databases, and audio notifications to
live help.
