**Publisher's Description**  
  


MSE Update Utility is a simple app that updates Microsoft Security Essentials when Windows Update is disabled. 

Windows Update service is responsible for frequently updating MSE. But once it is disabled MSE wonAt update anymore.

MicrosoftAs idea for merging the MSE update with Windows Update is perhaps the biggest downside of MSE and the only workaround until today was to manually grab the latest virus definitions. Since MSE virus definitions are updated almost daily, the manual route was quite tiresome. This is where MSE Update Utility comes in.

**WhatA's New in version 1.1:**

  * You can now select the directory where you want to install the app 
  * You donAt need to disable the UAC anymore in order to make it work during startup 
  * The whole setup has been changed and is faster than before 
  * The app is finally stable(fixed some bugs).
