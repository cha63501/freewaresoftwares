**Publisher's Description**  
  

Autoruns, which has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting
locations of any startup monitor, shows you what programs are configured to
run during system bootup or login, and shows you the entries in the order
Windows processes them.

These programs include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other
Registry keys. You can configure Autoruns to show other locations, including
Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon
notifications, auto-start services, and much more. Autoruns goes way beyond
the MSConfig utility bundled with Windows Me and XP.

Autoruns' Hide Signed Microsoft Entries option helps you to zoom in on third-
party auto-starting images that have been added to your system and it has
support for looking at the auto-starting images configured for other accounts
configured on a system. Also included in the download package is a command-
line equivalent that can output in CSV format, Autorunsc.

**WhatA's New in version 11.70:**

  * adds a new option to have it show only per-user locations, something that is useful when analyzing the autostarts of different accounts than the one that Autoruns is running under.
