**Publisher's Description**  
  


Softoy V3pad is launcher software for the anti-virus program V3+Neo. V3+Neo carries a high-speed virus scan engine and is updated one or more times per week. V3+NeoA's engine has no superior in scan speed and update terms, but unfortunately, V3+Neo is a MSDOS program which renders it inconvenient to use. V3pad is made to use V3+Neo conveniently under Windows. 

V3pad launches V3+Neo for a folder name or file name, and V3+Neo diagnoses and repairs it. You can select the target folder or file in Windows Explorer or input the name in an edit box. If you designate a .zip file then V3pad extracts it in a new folder and scans the folder.

V3pad checks V3+Neo updates hourly and downloads new versions from the V3+Neo web site and updates engine. V3pad needs a good Internet connection to use effectively. V3pad is free for use and distribution.
