**Publisher's Description**  
  

Happy99Cleaner is a great tool for removing the Happ99.exe virus from your
computer. Happy99.exe is an e-mail and newsgroup worm virus, which attaches
itself to email and newsgoup postings. When the exe file is clicked, it
displays "Happy New Year 1999 !!" and fireworks while it alters your computer
data. It does not corrupt any data or render your computer useless, it just
attaches itself to your email and newsgroup messages, sending the virus to
your recipients.

Happy99Cleaner will safely test and remove Happy99.exe from your system. If
you unknowingly had the virus, Happy99Cleaner will create a list of recipients
who may have received the virus from you. This list is taken from LISTE.SKA,
which is a file created by the Happy99.exe virus. *NOTE: Happy99Cleaner does
not protect your computer from the virus, it simply checks your system for its
presence and "cleans" your system if the virus is found.
