**Publisher's Description**  
  

Web pages that contain exploits often use a series of redirects and obfuscated
code to make it more difficult for somebody to follow. Malzilla is a useful
utility that enables you to explore malicious webpages.

Malzilla allows you to choose your own user agent and referrer, and has the
ability to use proxies. It shows you the full source of webpages and all the
HTTP headers. It gives you various decoders to try and deobfuscate javascript
as well.
