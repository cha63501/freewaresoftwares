Web pages that contain exploits often use a series of redirects and obfuscated code to make it more difficult for somebody to follow. Malzilla is a useful utility that enables you to explore malicious webpages. 

Malzilla allows you to choose your own user agent and referrer, and has the ability to use proxies. It shows you the full source of webpages and all the HTTP headers. It gives you various decoders to try and deobfuscate javascript as well.
