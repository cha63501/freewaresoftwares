**Publisher's Description**  
  


Immunos is one of the easiest to use anti-virus programs available on the Internet. These kind of programs are usually sophisticated and require some technical skills from the users - this is not the case with Immunos - it was developed as an efficient protecting tool for computers of those less savvy in this area. 

The program offers great detection and removal abilities and can usually identify viruses that have been missed by the other scanners. It can be configured to perform auto-updates at the interval chosen by the user.

Immunos is a malware-scanner anyone can use: straightforward in appearance - it has a clean, simple but chic interface with five large icons displayed to the left - Scan, Update, Config, Log, Help. Clicking on the last icon gets you access to more information about the program and answers you might have on how to use it.

Once installed, Immunos fully integrates into your system giving you the possibility to scan any individual file at any time - simply right-click on a certain file and you will see the Scan with Immunos option.

Another strong point of Immunos is its modest requirements when it comes to resource consumption.

When scanning with Immunos you can choose to scan subdirectories recursively, remove temporary files and add to context menu explorer. The program runs discretely in the background using the system tray.
