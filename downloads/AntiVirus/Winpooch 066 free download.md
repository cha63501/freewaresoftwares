**Publisher's Description**  
  

Winpooch is a Windows watchdog. By adding this free watchdog, you increase the
safety of your anti-virus. It detects spyware and trojans as soon as they are
installed in you computer.

The Windows watchdog scans system directories and the registry in real time,
and uses very few process resources. After being attacked by some vicious
programs such as a trojan or spyware, the idea to develop a kind of anti-
furtive-attack raised. The problem with that kind of virus is to detect "that
it has attacked the machine". Some nice firewall or virus protection programs
are efficient, but there are not always free.

So here is a nice and simple watchdog that will take care of your machineA's
system. Winpooch only scans some specific directories and registry key. The
team is adding features thanks to some users requests.
