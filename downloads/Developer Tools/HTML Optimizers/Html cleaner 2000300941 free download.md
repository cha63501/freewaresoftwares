**Publisher's Description**  
  

HTML Cleaner removes superfluous white space, quotes, comments, and end tags
from HTML documents. The result will render identically in a web browser, but
is typically 15-20% smaller than the original file. This reduces download
time, web page responsiveness, and web server storage demands.

Optionally, HTML Cleaner can also remove images, styles, scripts, and active
content from HTML documents. Use this if you want to test your HTML
documentA's behaviour in situations where image downloads are switched off or
not applicable (text-only browsers, screen readers), style sheets are not
supported, or active content is disabled.
