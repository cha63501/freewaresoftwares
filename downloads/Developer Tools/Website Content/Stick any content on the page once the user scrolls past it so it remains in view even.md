**Publisher's Description**  
  


This simple script lets you stick any content on the page once the user scrolls past it so it remains in view even afterwards. It does this by cloning the element first before giving the newly minted element a CSS position of "fixed". Specify if the content should stop being "sticky" after x seconds, and also, whether to apply a CSS class to it while it is.
