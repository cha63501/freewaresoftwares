**Publisher's Description**  
  

AudioFlash allows you to quickly and easily add audio to your website by
creating MP3 compressed audio files and a set of Play, Pause and Stop buttons
(SWF Flash) enabling visitors to have complete control over the audio.

Once your audio and buttons have been created, you can either copy and paste
the generated HTML into another webpage or use the built-in FTP client to
upload everything as-is to your server.

Here are just a few ways you can use this software:

  * Use it to record information to help sell your product or service 
  * Create multiple answers to frequently asked questions 
  * You can create audio tutorials for school or college class 
  * Explain a problem more clearly for technical support 
  * Create online audio information products you can sell 
  * Use it to create podcasts on your chosen subject 
  * Record audio notes on new tricks and techniques for software programs and upload them to your server, so you never forget them
