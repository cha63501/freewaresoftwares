**Publisher's Description**  
  


We are offering you a universal flash menu tool where you can customize practically any parameter. More than 1600 variants are possible, not taking into account all color and transparency variations. Parameters of the sub menu buttons can be customized independently of the main menu buttons. You will also appreciate simplicity of the "Total menu": it takes changing only one parameter to turn a horizontal menu into a vertical one!  


The Total Menu is made in Flash but it does not require Flash to be customized. You can use almost any HTML editor to insert our menu in a web page and adopt it to your needs. Total Menu is a simple Flash file (swf file), that can be customized by editing a configuration file (XML file) that must be placed in the same directory as the menu, so you can customize the menu using any text editor. Warning! the file should be saved as "menu.xml", always in UTF-8 encoding.

In case you experience difficulties in changing the configuration file, for your convenience we have developed the "Total Menu XML creator", which you can access on our website www.flash-extensions.net

As a limitation in the free version of the menu:

  * You cannot change the first button that always links to us (www.flash-extensions.net). 
  * You do not receive the source file.
