**Publisher's Description**  
  

EntityConvert is a really simple little freeware tool for converting all
special characters into their character entity values.

If you are writing a web page or a blog or anything else designed to be viewed
in a browser or as XML, and youA'd like to include some text that has some
special characters in there - such as code listings - youA'll often run into
problems with your browser trying to parse the code listings as HTML or as
XML, as well as your page or XML no longer being valid. For example say you
were trying to display some PHP or XHTML listings on a web page, where there
is a or even a & character - quite often in the case of PHP - you may get
large chunks of your code listing disappearing or breaking your page layout
and so on.

With EntityConvert you can just past in the code you want to put on your page,
click a button and then all of the code is changed to use nice character
entity values. So all those trouble some and & characters have now been
automatically converted to and &. But thats not all it does, EntityConvert
will convert all of the special characters to their chacter values for you.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or
above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
