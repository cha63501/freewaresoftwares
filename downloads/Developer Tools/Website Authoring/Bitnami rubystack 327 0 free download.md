**Publisher's Description**  
  

BitNami RubyStack Native Installer is an easy-to-install environment to
develop and deploy Ruby on Rails applications. It includes pre-configured,
ready-to-run versions of Apache, MySQL, Ruby and Rails so users can get the
environment up and running in minutes after answering a few questions.
Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems are supported.

Ruby on Rails is a full-stack MVC framework for database-backed web
applications that is optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable
productivity. It lets you write beautiful code by favoring convention over
configuration.

Here are some key features of the BitNami Stacks Native Installers:

**Easy to Install:**  
BitNami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as possible
to install open source software. Our installers completely automate the
process of installing and configuring all of the software included in each
Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

**Independent:**  
BitNami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere
with any software already installed on your system.

**Integrated:**  
By the time you click the A'finishA' button on the installer, the whole stack
will be integrated, configured and ready to go.

**Relocatable:**  
BitNami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have
multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each
other.
