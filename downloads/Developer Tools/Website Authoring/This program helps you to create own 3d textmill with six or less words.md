This program helps you to create own 3D textmill with six or less words. 3D engine is very small (near 5 Kb), so even slowest modems could show mill very fast (in 1 sec). 

The main feature of program is its simplicity. Type words you want to use, select style, color, font of textmill, then press "Make It!". ThatA's all! 3D textmill is ready. You need only to save it. 

You can select three types of saveing: as monolyte HTML file with including script, script file (JS) and your_file_name.HTML file with separate js unit. We recommend third way of saving because it is more comfortable for web designer.
