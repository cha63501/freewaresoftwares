**Publisher's Description**  
  

CraigA's Text-to-HTML Converter is a small, simple, easy-to-use and free
software program that converts plain text into a valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional
document. As a simple, single-function application to handle special character
conversion, it seems to work just fine. CraigA's Text-to-HTML Converter is
also pretty small and does not require any installation.
