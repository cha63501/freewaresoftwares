**Publisher's Description**  
  

HTML Combiner is a small utility program that allows you to reuse your common
HTML content in multiple webpages without using server side includes (or
another server side technology) or resorting to iframes, which have their own
drawbacks. If you have common blocks of HTML code, HTML Combiner allows you to
reuse them. Place tags in your webpages, configure your build, and HTML
Combiner will go through your webpages and insert the common blocks of code.

**Use HTML Combiner if: **

  * You have common elements of your website (such as a side bar of links) you would like to reuse without having to change individual webpages 
  * You do not wish to use Javascript or other client side scripting technologies to reuse your HTML content 
  * Your web server does not support Server Side Includes (SSI) or other server side technologies 
  * You want code reuse using simple HTML code 
  * You would like to exclude certain blocks of code from your website depending on the situation 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
