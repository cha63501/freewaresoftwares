**Publisher's Description**  
  

A free utility that helps you put large documents on the Internet (or into
HTML format). This is done by splitting each document into smaller HTML
documents, and by linking these documents together.

A lot of documents are asking to be published on the Internet. But when large
documents are directly converted to the HTML format, the resulting pages are
not easy to read. Reading them goes with a lot of scrolling.

Therefore, it would be better to split them up. You can do this by hand, but
wouldnA't it be nice to let your computer do it for you? This is now possible,
using the HTML Splitter program.

Each file will contain links to the previous file and to the next file. It is
also possible to add a "You are here" link on top of each page. At the same
time, an index file is created, named myfile000.htm, with links to all the
other files.

HTML Splitter divides the document starting from header styles.

HTML Splitter can split documents created with:

  * Word XP (aka 2002) 
  * Word 2000 
  * WordPro Millennium 
  * Frontpage Express 
However, this list is not exclusive.
