**Publisher's Description**  
  

BitNami MAPPStack Native Installer is an easy-to-install environment to
develop and deploy PHP applications. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run
versions of Apache, PostgreSQL, PHP and phpPgAdmin so users can get the
environment up and running in minutes after answering a few questions. Mac OS
X operating systems are supported.

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in.
The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
generated pages quickly.

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It
has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that
has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and
correctness. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys,
joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages).
