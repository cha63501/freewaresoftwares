**Publisher's Description**  
  

ProtoPad is essentially a what-you-see-is-what-you-get rich text editor,
designed primarily for webmasters, and anyone who needs to generate content
where a lot of the other online editors and text boxes just wonA't do.

This application lets you both generate content and the HTML output in a word
processor-styled interface. This is also the perfect application for someone
who is interested in Internet Explorer as a development platform. It is
basically configured to send its content to an ASP page. However a PHP page,
CGI or Perl script could be integrated with the editor, in much the same way a
form would. The only caveat is that it is only Internet Explorer compatible.

It is freely distributed with its source code. To run it as a standalone
application, just launch the .hta file, "protopad.hta".
