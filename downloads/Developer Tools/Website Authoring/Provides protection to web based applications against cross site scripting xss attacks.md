**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library V4.0 (AntiXSS V4.0) is an encoding library designed to help developers protect their ASP.NET web-based applications from XSS attacks. 

It differs from most encoding libraries in that it uses the white-listing technique -- sometimes referred to as the principle of inclusions -- to provide protection against XSS attacks. This approach works by first defining a valid or allowable set of characters, and encodes anything outside this set (invalid characters or potential attacks). 

The white-listing approach provides several advantages over other encoding schemes. 

**Features:**

  * A customizable safe list for HTML and XML encoding 
  * Performance improvements 
  * Support for Medium Trust ASP.NET applications 
  * HTML Named Entity Support 
  * Invalid Unicode detection 
  * Improved Surrogate Character Support for HTML and XML encoding 
  * LDAP Encoding Improvements 
  * application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding support 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).

**Supported Operating Systems:** Windows 7; Windows Server 2003; Windows Server 2008; Windows Vista; Windows XP
