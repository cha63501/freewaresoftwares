**Publisher's Description**  
  

trillbox is a flexible and extendable toolkit for building dynamic web pages.
Written in Perl and based on Template::Recall, it provides "widgets" (or
controls) that you can quickly integrate into your Perl web application.

ItA's easy and intuitive to use. Widgets are created as modules and included
into your code as objects. The toolkit can be used with CGI, mod_perl,
PerlScript, or just about any web programming orientation of Perl.
