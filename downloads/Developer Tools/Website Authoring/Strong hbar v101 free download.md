**Publisher's Description**  
  

Use this tool if you want to add a horizontal navigation bar consisting of
many tabs to your site. Such a menu has a very user-friendly interface and
makes it considerably easier to navigate through the website. It is usually
used to navigate through the main sections of the site. Menus created with it
are completely based on CSS and do not use scripts that is why they are most
attractive for search engines. These menus perfectly work in all modern
browsers. We have successfully tested them in Internet Explorer 6, FireFox
1.0, Opera 9, Konqueror 3.5.2, Netscape 7.
