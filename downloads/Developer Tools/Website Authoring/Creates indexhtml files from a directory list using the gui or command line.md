dirhtml creates index.html files from a directory list using the GUI or command line, optionally including HTML code of your own design at any point in the generated file. With dirhtml, your index.html files can be unique and arbitrarily complex. 

**WhatA's New in version 4.861:**

  * Scripts are correctly located if the folder being searched is a network address and the script has a relative file location. 
  * Folders can be dropped onto the 'Folders, Files' page, which will replace the existing selected folder. A successful folder drop will also add the folder to the drop-down list. 
  * Previously added date modified strings are restored when the program is restarted
