**Publisher's Description**  
  

It is a builder of vertical navigation menus. Use VMenu when you want to add a
vertical navigation menu to your site. Due to the possibility to add
captions/subcaptions to the menu, you can group items and create large
navigation menus with really usable interfaces. Menus created with it are
completely based on CSS and do not use scripts that is why they are most
attractive for search engines. These menus perfectly work in all modern
browsers. We have successfully tested them in Internet Explorer 6, FireFox
1.0, Opera 9, Konqueror 3.5.2, Netscape 7.
