**Publisher's Description**  
  


Paessler Site Inspector is a web browser that combines the two most frequently used browser engines (Internet Explorer and Mozilla/Gecko) into one program. Its advanced analysis features make it the perfect companion for webmasters and web developers. With Site InspectorA's internal browser, users can switch between the two browser engines with just one mouse click, for example to compare the rendering of a page in both browsers. The sophisticated analysis functions, which also integrate into Internet Explorer and Firefox, make analyzing and debugging web sites easy. 

The analysis features can be accessed from within the Analyzing Browser as well, with convenient toolbars that Site Inspector adds to Internet Explorer and the Mozilla Firefox browser. Whenever you access a web page using Internet Explorer, Firefox or Site InspectorA's browser, you will find a wealth of analysis functions in the toolbars and menus.

For example: 

  * For any given URL, users can access lists of the images, forms, links, frames, meta tags or the scripts of a web page as well as the HTML source and HTTP headers. 
  * Using the Highlight function, users can mark any HTML tag with a colored border inside the rendered web page (e.g., to show all TD tags in a page). An invaluable tool for web designers. 
  * A pixel grid as well as guide lines can be shown applied to a web page. 
  * All image tags and link URLs can be shown from within a web page. 
  * You can copy the page URL, page title, page source, list of URLs and even the page as a bitmap to the clipboard. 
  * The browser window can be resized to various standard screen sizes (e.g. 800x600) and you can zoom into a web page. 
An extensive selection of tools that are available online (e.g. "CSS/HTML validation", "link checking", "ping the server", "traceroute the server", "show domain owner", "W3C markup validation") are also included and can be customized according to requirements.
