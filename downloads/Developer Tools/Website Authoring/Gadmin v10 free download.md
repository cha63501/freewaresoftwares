**Publisher's Description**  
  

This free, customizable CGI (PERL) based Picture Gallery Administration
utility can manage the galleries on the host eliminating the need to download
your changes.

If your host does not provide cgi-bin functionality, alternate methods exist
for the more adventurous individuals.

You can create galleries, add to galleries, modify galleries, delete from
galleries, and delete entire galleries.

Larger pics and the thumbnails must be uploaded by the administrator.
