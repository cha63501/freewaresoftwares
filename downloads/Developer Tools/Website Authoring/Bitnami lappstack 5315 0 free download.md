**Publisher's Description**  
  

BitNami LAPPStack Native Installer is an easy-to-install environment to
develop and deploy PHP applications. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run
versions of Apache, PostgreSQL, PHP and phpPgAdmin. Amazon AWS PHP SDK makes
it easier to develop PHP applications that run on Amazon Web Services. The AWS
PHP SDK includes the AWS PHP library, code samples and documentation.

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in.
The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
generated pages quickly.

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It
has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that
has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and
correctness. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys,
joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages).
