**Publisher's Description**  
  


OpenCms 8 contains a greatly improved user interface for content managers and numerous other enhancements. The "Advanced Direct Edit" mode allows content managers to create page content by drag & drop. The new sitemap editor allows creating new pages and rearranging the navigation tree by drag & drop. 

In version 8.0.2 itA's now possible to easily enable drag & drop for any existing JSP by just creating a reference to the JSP with the new ADE resource type "Dynamic Function". Furthermore, refined element permissions for ADE now support Elements dragable by everyone, but editable only with special permissions. 

Group containers now have a "Break Up" option which removes the group and places all elements individually on currently edited page, making it easier to create pages with slightly different configurations. 

If a content is previewed in the ADE content gallery, it can now directly be dragged & dropped from the content preview to the current page. 

In Version 8.0.2 the sitemap editor now displays status information such as title and VFS location above the currently edited sitemap and features a "go to the parent sitemap" option in the toolbar. 

The significantly improved sitemap configuration options in OpenCms 8.0.2 make it much easier to create sophisticated special configurations. 

Another new feature - XSD path translation - automatically checks and rewrites paths in referencing XML content when the XSD file is moved or renamed. The improved server side filtering in OpenCms 8.0.2 helps avoid Cross Site Scripting (XSS). And for SEO aspects, the Sitemap Editor now has a refined naming schema for automatically created resources. 

In version 8.0.2 OpenCms now even supports Apache Tomcat 7 and can be deployed to a wide range of open source environments (Linux, Apache, Tomcat, JBoss, GlassFish, Resin, MySQL, PostgreSQL) or commercial components (Windows, Unix, Solaris, IIS, BEA Weblogic, Oracle, MS SQL). The outstanding, totally browser-based GUI works with all the latest top browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari). 

OpenCms 8.0.2 is fully backward compatible to all prior 7.x versions. Templates and other OpenCms developed code from version 7.0 or 7.5 should work "out of the box" with version 8.0.2. 

Upgrading to OpenCms 8.0.2 is more than worthwhile, since the legacy direct edit provider for pages using "old" templates now allows to open the "Property" dialog to edit the page properties in direct edit mode. 

An easy to use update wizard is available, too.
