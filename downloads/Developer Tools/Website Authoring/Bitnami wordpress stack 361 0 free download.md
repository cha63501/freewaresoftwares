**Publisher's Description**  
  

BitNami WordPress Stack Native Installer is an easy-to-install distribution of
the WordPress application. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run versions
of Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin so users can get a WordPress installation
up and running in minutes after answering a few questions. Windows, Linux, Mac
OS X and Unix operating systems are supported.

WordPress is a state-of-the-art publishing platform with a focus on
aesthetics, web standards, and usability. WordPress is both free and priceless
at the same time. The project was started in 2003. Since then it has grown to
be the largest self-hosted blogging tool in the world, used on millions of
sites and seen by tens of millions of people every day.

Here are some key features of the BitNami Stacks Native Installers:

**Easy to Install:**  
BitNami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as possible
to install open source software. Our installers completely automate the
process of installing and configuring all of the software included in each
Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

**Independent:**  
BitNami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere
with any software already installed on your system.

**Integrated:**  
By the time you click the A'finishA' button on the installer, the whole stack
will be integrated, configured and ready to go.

**Relocatable:**  
BitNami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have
multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each
other.

**WhatA's New in version 3.6.1-0:**

  * Updated WordPress to 3.6.1 
  * Updated plugins to latest versions
