**Publisher's Description**  
  

MetaMaestro is a simple little tool designed purely for creating syntactically
correct Meta Tags for use in your HTML/XHTML, allowing you to use a simple and
familiar windows interface to make sure that your Meta Tags meet the required
standards to ensure you keep up with the latest trends in SEO (search engine
optimisation).  
  
By making good use of meta tags within your pages, you can improve your sites
listing in Google and other search engines like MSN and Yahoo. Improving your
rank in the SERPs (search engine result pages) can lead to increased traffic.
By increasing your ranking and traffic, you are more likely to get more
inbound links, which may eventaully result in more revenue!  
  
MetaMaestro allows you to create the most common and important Meta Tags
listed including:

  * Description 
  * Keywords 
  * Title 
  * Robots 
  * Copyright 
  * Author 
  
MetaMaestro allows you to load and save your Meta Tag data in an open XML
format, and unlike most other Meta Tag Editors it actually allows you to
import Meta Tag data from existing HTML files on your computer, or even import
Meta Tag data from existing web sites on the net! Having imported this data,
you can then save a local copy for use later or just see how others have
approached SEO using Meta Tags.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or
above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
