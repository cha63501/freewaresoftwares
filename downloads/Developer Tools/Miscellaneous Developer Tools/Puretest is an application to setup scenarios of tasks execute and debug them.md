**Publisher's Description**  
  


PureTest is implemented in Java and runs on all platforms supporting Java 1.5. We verify PureTest on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris. 

Being platform indepedent means that you do not have to invest in specialized hardware/software. Use your computing resources already available. 

PureTest includes extensive support for testing web applications using HTTP/HTTPS.

PureTest is designed to be independent of the technology used on the server side. This is achieved by working on a protocol level and simulating the traffic generated between the client and the server. 

PureTest supports a range of standard internet protocols. Each protocol is supported by a set of PureTest tasks (in addition to utilitity tasks).
