Site Popularity Meter is an application that helps you find how your site
compares with that of your competitors.

Site Popularity Meter retrieves this information from Alexa and provides it in
a clean tabular display. Simply type in the URL, click Go and the software
will retrieve the ranking and the number of Alexa visits. All information is
displayed in a nice table. You can right click within the list for various
options. You may click on the list headings to sort the list (rank wise, site
wise, etc.)

Site Popularity Meter simply connects to the Alexa website and retrieves a web
page from it. It is safe to use and doesn?t monitor any activity on your own
system. You need not install Alexa in your system to use this software.
However installing Alexa will allow you to instantly see the popularity of
every site you visit. You might want to visit the Alexa website (Alexa.Com)
for more information.
