**Publisher's Description**  
  

ClarityPro is used to create programs through drawing rather than by typing
text. The approach is particularly helpful for designers that think and design
using diagrams. The approach will allow a designer to create software that:

  * is quicker to produce 
  * will have significantly less errors 
  * is easier to maintain 
  * will last longer 
  * is more reliable 
The Clarity Kit (downloaded) contains all the versions of the ClarityPro
series and the facilities to allow functionality extensions of ClarityPro.
Running ClarityPro within your own program can also be done as a separate
Dynamic Link Library or alternatively as a link in the interpreter. This will
provide the option of developing functions in ClarityPro that can be run
within your own program.
