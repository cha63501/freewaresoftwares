**Publisher's Description**  
  

MOZiE is an extremely light-weight, free Windows application that allows web
designers the ability to compare page rendering in Mozilla and Internet
Explorer simultaneously.

MOZiE also contains other useful features such as: various screen-size
emulations, the ability to launch active pages in external browsers (such as
Opera) directly from the interface as well as IE 5 & 5.5 standalone support.

MOZiE is a work in progress. Feedback is greatly appreciated as it will assist
in the improvement of the tool. As well, encouraging, constructive feedback is
always a good incentive to continue development.

MOZiE is (unfortunately) available only to Windows users running IE5+. Users
must either register the Mozilla ActiveX control (if Mozilla 1.5+ is already
installed) by simply opening the command prompt, going to the folder
containing "mozctlx.dll" and typing "regsvr32 mozctlx.dll".

If users do not have Mozilla ActiveX control, download it
[here](http://www.iol.ie/%7Elocka/mozilla/MozillaControl16.exe).
