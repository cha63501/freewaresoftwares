**Publisher's Description**  
  

Cyotek WebCopy is a free tool to copy websites locally for offline viewing.
Webcopy is highly customizable allowing you to copy full or partial websites,
control scan behaviour, post login forms, view internal and external links via
Link Map Viewer, and more.

WebCopy automatically remaps links to stylesheets, images, and other pages to
match the local path. Additionally, extensive reports are provided to view the
overall health of your website such as errors, missing pages, media sources,
as well as other useful information.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).

**WhatA's new in version 1.0.7.6:**

**Changes and new features:**

  * Panels in Option dialogs now load on demand 
  * Option pages are now only initialized when requested by the appropriate dialog 
  * Removed status code 520 (origin error) from the list of supported codes for automated error reporting during a crawl 
  * The Image Viewer window no longer defaults to Fit when displaying an image, but now defaults to Actual size 
  * Added additional themes for configuring the appearance of the GUI client window 

**Bug fixes:**

  * Fixed an issue cloning LinkInfo objects which hopefully is responsible for a rare Cannot access a disposed object crash using the Quick Scan dialog 
  * Fixed an issue where the sitemap tree view could be populated up to 3 times rather than the expected once when opening a project 
  * Dynamic options in the Options dialog are now positioned more sensibly in relation to the options label and editor, and other options in the same group 
  * Fixed a problem where tool tips did not display under certain conditions, or could display the wrong (or blank) text 
  * Extension mapping for dropped files was case sensitive 
  * Reworked tool bar layout code to prevent overflowed buttons 
  * Removed a number of integration hacks
