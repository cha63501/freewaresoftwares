**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you want to create and manage sprite sheets or separate sprite graphics,
then Cyotek Spriter is a suitable application for your needs. The application
allows you to use multiple image sources to create a sprite sheet.

CSS sprites reduce the number of image requests considerably because all
images are stored into one file and loaded at once. Once the images have been
loaded, they are simply retrieved from cache whenever they are needed.

To add multiple images to a sprite sheet, simply drag files and folders and
drop them onto the application window. Cyotek Spriter automatically calculates
relevant coordinates and generates appropriate CSS code.

Although the application is primarily designed for CSS, you can use it to
output any text based document. The text sprites can have different shadow
effects, glow, gradient, rotation and outline.

You can apply effects to selected images to transform them without changing
the source files. You will create HTML and CSS files easily with templates,
which you may customize to suit your projects. The output options are so
flexible that you can use them to create sprite sheets for a variety of tasks,
including tool strips for applications and arcade games.

Although you may use Cyotek Sprite for free, you are invited to donate if you
find it useful.
