**Publisher's Description**  
  


ClarityPro is used to create programs through drawing rather than by typing text. The approach is particularly helpful for designers that think and design using diagrams. The approach will allow a designer to create software that: 

  * is quicker to produce 
  * will have significantly less errors 
  * is easier to maintain 
  * will last longer 
  * is more reliable 
The Clarity Kit (downloaded) contains all the versions of the ClarityPro series and the facilities to allow functionality extensions of ClarityPro. Running ClarityPro within your own program can also be done as a separate Dynamic Link Library or alternatively as a link in the interpreter. This will provide the option of developing functions in ClarityPro that can be run within your own program.
