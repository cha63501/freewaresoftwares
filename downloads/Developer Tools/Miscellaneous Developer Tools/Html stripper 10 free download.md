**Publisher's Description**  
  

Strips the specified tags out of HTML. The program has an interface for
choosing which tags you want to include/exclude. The triangle or "Play" button
will use HTML from your clipboard, strip the tags and paste the results back
to the clipboard. This is all that the second program (htmlStripperQuick.exe)
does, but is more useful because it can be placed in your quicklauch toolbar
for easy use. You can still use the main program to edit which tags you want
it to strip out.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
