**Publisher's Description**  
  

Scrollbar Colorer is a simple program for web developers that generates CSS
for colored scrollbars. Just type in the color codes for the various parts of
the scrollbar, press the button, and Presto! you have some CSS code that you
can paste into a webpage and liven things up.

It is very small, taking only about 19KB. The download size is even smaller,
since itA's distributed as a zipped file. The reason it is so small is because
it is actually an HTML application (See [this
article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536496\(VS.85\).aspx) on
the Microsoft Developer Network) and uses JavaScript to generate the CSS code,
instead of C++ or Visual Basic.
