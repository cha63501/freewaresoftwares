**Publisher's Description**  
  

BinScope is a Microsoft verification tool that analyzes binaries on a project-
wide level to ensure that they have been built in compliance with MicrosoftAs
Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) requirements and recommendations.

BinScope checks that SDL-required compiler/linker flags are being set, strong-
named assemblies are in use, up-to-date build tools are in place, and the
latest good ATL headers are being used.

BinScope also reports on dangerous constructs that are prohibited by SDL.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
