**Publisher's Description**  
  


HHK2HTML is a simple utility to extract index links from a Windows-compiled help index file to a standard HTML file. The file extension of the compiled index file will be .hhk. This file contains an XML-like structure that can be read using a standard text editor. HHK2HTML scans these files and creates an HTML index based on the entries it finds. Created for Mac users who cannot access .chm compiled help files. 

To use this utility, locate the .hhk file, specify an output filename and location, enter a title for your HTML document, then click the A'Extract HTMLA' button. You can manually modify any HTML entries you see. Once complete, click the A'Save HTML to FileA' button, and your new index file will be created.
