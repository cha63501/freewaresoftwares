**Publisher's Description**  
  

New Audio Components are designed to help your Delphi programs perform
different sound processing tasks. With NewAC you can play audio stored in many
formats (wav, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Monkey Audio, WavPack, MP3, Windows WMA, True
Audio (TTA), OptimFROG, TAK, Musepack). The playback is performed in the
background, and although your application can control it (stop, pause, move
forward and backward, play in a loop) it can perform other tasks while audio
plays.

You can play sound not only from external files, but also from sound resources
embedded into your program, and, in fact, from any stream providing audio
data. But NewAC not only allows you to play sound, you can acquire audio data
from such input devices as microphone or CD, from live audio server, and
encode it into any of the audio formats mentioned above. While playing audio
stored in a file or while writing audio content to a file you can manipulate
tags supported by the chosen audio format.

In addition to all this, NewAC can perform some audio editing tasks, like
mixing and concatenating audio streams, selecting fragments of streams, and
performing sample rate and bits per sample conversions. Requires Delphi 6 or
later.
