**Publisher's Description**  
  

This useful form script automatically saves the contents of a form
periodically as the user types and recalls them in the event of an accidental
page refresh or even browser closing. Similar to how GMail automatically saves
the contents of your draft email, itA's an excellent feature to add to forms
that expect a lot of content and where losing them can cause a lot of grief
for the user filling the form out.
