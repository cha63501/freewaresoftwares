Source Viewer is a php coded web page allowing you to display the html and php
source code of files on your server directly in a browser. Using standard
browser View Source functions php code is not displayed as it is processed by
the server prior to the page being delivered to the browser. Source Viewer
allows the html and php code to be displayed. It displays page code directly
in your browser, including html and php coding.

An Allowed Directories function ensures visitors can only access the source
code of files in directories you nominate. Viewed files are identified by URL
(not server path) using a simple input field to provide ease of use. Source
Viewer allows you to show the underlying code of your web pages directly to
site visitors in their browser. ItA's free of charge.

Source Viewer works on any server that supports php.
