This useful form script automatically saves the contents of a form periodically as the user types and recalls them in the event of an accidental page refresh or even browser closing. Similar to how GMail automatically saves the contents of your draft email, itA's an excellent feature to add to forms that expect a lot of content and where losing them can cause a lot of grief for the user filling the form out.
