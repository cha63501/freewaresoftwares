**Publisher's Description**  
  

Kwatee fully automates deployments of text and/or binary files from a
reference software repository to any number of target servers in your
datacenter or in the cloud. Differential updates, that is, the deployment of
only files that are different from the ones already installed or that are new,
and deployment parallelization yield quick and bandwidth efficient updates of
even large applications.

Kwatee enables a high degree of flexibility in setting up application
configuration parameters. The same package can readily be deployed with
different parameters in various work contexts such as development, QA, support
or production. Professional Services departments can personalize (i.e. brand)
generic software packages on their own while taking the pain out of keeping
the personalization up-to-date with every new release.

Kwatee has a low entry barrier; you can configure your first deployment in
minutes but Kwatee can also tackle arbitrarily complex deployments. Kwatee is
lightweight; thereA's no proprietary scripting or declarative language and no
complicated concepts. Just use plain shell commands combined with scripts in
the language of your choice (Perl, Python, PowerShell, ...) where necessary.
