**Publisher's Description**  
  


htmlArea is a free WYSIWYG editor replacement for common textarea fields in HTML forms. Users can change the font size/color, make it bold/italicized/underlined, add bullets and numbering, insert images and links, and more. 

It works with any server-side software that accepts forms, including PHP, ASP, Perl, etc and enables users to format their content as easily as if they were using a Word Processor. No HTML knowledge is required. Once the form is submitted, the raw HTML is passed along through your CGI script for use in your program.

Requires Internet Explorer 5.5+
