**Publisher's Description**  
  

IE Flash Problem Solver disables Flash content blocking in a few seconds.

Microsoft has released updates to Internet Explorer that will change how it
handles active content such as that viewed in AdobeA's Macromedia Flash
Player, Authorware Player, Shockwave Player, and Adobe Reader, as well as Sun
Java, Apple QuickTime, RealNetworks RealPlayer and other ActiveX controls.

Active content that is embedded in HTML pages in certain ways will not be able
to receive user input (for example, keyboard or mouse events) until the user
clicks to either activate or continue loading the control.

Use Softery IE Flash Problem Solver for Dreamweaver to check and to fix your
whole website automatically without any special knowledge.
