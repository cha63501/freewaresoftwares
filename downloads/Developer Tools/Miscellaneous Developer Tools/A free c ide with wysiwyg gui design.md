**Publisher's Description**  
  


Auto C is a practical and easy to use C IDE. It is intended for anyone who wants to work with the C programming language under Windows. Drawing controls on a form using a mouse is all you need to do to create the skeleton for a generic SDK C Windows Application. Use a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) design environment. Auto C works with Windows 2000, Windows XP and later. 

Auto C is an add-in for WoLoSoft InternationalA's SuperEdi, which is required. It integrates Microsoft ActiveX Control Pad with SuperEdi. The use of four popular C/C++ compilers is supported. Auto C creates a generic C application based on a user interface that you create and edit like a VB form. 

Auto C does not create dialog box RC scripts. It generates the C code to do many things, such as: Change foreground and background colors from the defaults for many controls, specify the font for a control to use, subclass a picturebox just by drawing controls inside it, specify the tooltip for a control to display, create a toolbar and buttons and set each buttonA's properties, and much more. 

Also, Auto C creates RC Script for menus and accelerators. Use of the following controls is supported: Command Button, Check Box, Option Button, Frame, Text Box, List Box, Combo Box, Label, Picture Box, Tabstrip, Slider, Up-Down Button, Scrollbar, Toolbar, Progress Bar, Status Bar. 

Auto C also supports creating and editing Menus in a point-and-click visual style. Using these free compilers is supported: Borland Free C++ Compiler 5.5, LCC-Win32, Pelles C, Open Watcom C/C++. Auto C is ideal for Visual Studio 6 owners. ActiveX Control Pad is included on the MSDN Library 6 CD and the MSDN Library can be used for keyword help in SuperEdi. Refer to Auto CA's help file for more information. 

Auto C helps de-mystify the fundamentals of Windows and also how dynamic link libraries are used. It can generate the code needed to load a DLL and use the DLLA's functions.

**Note:** Requires [SuperEdi](http://www.freewarefiles.com/SuperEdi-U_program_9565.html).
