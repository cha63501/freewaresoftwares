**Publisher's Description**  
  


AscToTab is a utility that converts *plain*, comma-separated or tab-delimited text files containing table data into either HTML or RTF (rich text format) tables. For plain text files AscToTab will attempt to determine how many columns the table has; the default alignment of each column; which rows are header rows. 

It will also spot entries that span several columns or several rows. For HTML production the user can select table attributes such as BORDER, WIDTH, CELLPADDING, CELLSPACING, BGCOLOR, BORDERCOLOR and CAPTION. For those files containing tab-delimited data the table is created from the tab-delimited cells line-by-line. You can choose what type of source file you have, and whether you want to convert text to HTML tables or convert text to RTF tables.
