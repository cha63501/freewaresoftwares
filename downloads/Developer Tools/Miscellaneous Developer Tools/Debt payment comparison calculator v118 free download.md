**Publisher's Description**  
  

How much would your payments go up if you paid your home mortgage in 20 years
instead of 30? Or, what would happen if you sent an extra $50 to the mortgage
company every month? Debt Payment Comparison Calculator was built to help
people figure out exactly that by comparing different payment scenarios for
their debts.

Debt Payment Comparison Calculator is a free, flexible tool for your web site
that does more than just calculate monthly payments. In addition to what
typical web calculators do, which is grab the principle, interest rate, and
the years to pay it off to generate your monthly payment, this Calculator can
also tell you how long it would take you to pay off a debt if you increased or
decreased the payment amount.
