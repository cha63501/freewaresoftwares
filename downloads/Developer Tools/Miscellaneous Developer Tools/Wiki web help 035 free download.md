**Publisher's Description**  
  

The wiki has become the clear choice for use among projects for their help
documentation. This project takes the wiki concept and tailors it for use
specifically for help documentation. It combines the best of both worlds with
the operation similar to a chm viewer and the web technologies that enable
community involvement. This project needs help with all aspects of
development, design and translation. If you have experience with javascript,
css, php and mysql, or would like to help with the translation, please join us
in creating the future in help documentation.
