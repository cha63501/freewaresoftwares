**Publisher's Description**  
  


MouseTracks is a VERY small, simple and handy piece of software I made for my own use when I was exploring win32API calls. It very simply gives you windows Class, Handle and Caption of what ever window (and itA's Parent), that you have the mouse pointer over. If you develop software, this comes in handy if you need to control or access other program windows. 

How do I use it?  
Just click anywhere on the main program window OR press the Spacebar, to start and stop MouseTracks!

MouseTracks is a single exe! So you can put it anywhere! No other files are written to your hard drive! Enjoy!
