**Publisher's Description**  
  

Auto C is a practical and easy to use C IDE. It is intended for anyone who
wants to work with the C programming language under Windows. Drawing controls
on a form using a mouse is all you need to do to create the skeleton for a
generic SDK C Windows Application. Use a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you
get) design environment. Auto C works with Windows 2000, Windows XP and later.

Auto C is an add-in for WoLoSoft InternationalA's SuperEdi, which is required.
It integrates Microsoft ActiveX Control Pad with SuperEdi. The use of four
popular C/C++ compilers is supported. Auto C creates a generic C application
based on a user interface that you create and edit like a VB form.

Auto C does not create dialog box RC scripts. It generates the C code to do
many things, such as: Change foreground and background colors from the
defaults for many controls, specify the font for a control to use, subclass a
picturebox just by drawing controls inside it, specify the tooltip for a
control to display, create a toolbar and buttons and set each buttonA's
properties, and much more.

Also, Auto C creates RC Script for menus and accelerators. Use of the
following controls is supported: Command Button, Check Box, Option Button,
Frame, Text Box, List Box, Combo Box, Label, Picture Box, Tabstrip, Slider,
Up-Down Button, Scrollbar, Toolbar, Progress Bar, Status Bar.

Auto C also supports creating and editing Menus in a point-and-click visual
style. Using these free compilers is supported: Borland Free C++ Compiler 5.5,
LCC-Win32, Pelles C, Open Watcom C/C++. Auto C is ideal for Visual Studio 6
owners. ActiveX Control Pad is included on the MSDN Library 6 CD and the MSDN
Library can be used for keyword help in SuperEdi. Refer to Auto CA's help file
for more information.

Auto C helps de-mystify the fundamentals of Windows and also how dynamic link
libraries are used. It can generate the code needed to load a DLL and use the
DLLA's functions.

**Note:** Requires [SuperEdi](http://www.freewarefiles.com/SuperEdi-U_program_9565.html).
