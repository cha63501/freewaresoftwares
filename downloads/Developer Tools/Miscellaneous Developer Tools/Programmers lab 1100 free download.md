**Publisher's Description**  
  

ProgrammerA's Lab contains over 490 functions that will enhance the power of
limited software languages, or make difficult languages easier to use. It even
acts as a batch file enhancer.

All functions (date, time, file, folder, math, system, media, networking, and
string commands) run from a simple shellexecute command & send output to a
textbox, a file, or the clipboard. Distribute with your software for
guaranteed functionality.

**Features:**

  * Reduces anywhere from 5 to 20 lines of code to just one. 
  * Comes with an easy-to-use interface for safe testing and experimentation. 
  * Takes up just 510KB of disk space. (ThatA's tiny!) 
  * Automatically updates without any effort on your part. 
  * Makes the complex simple and the inconceivable believable. 
  * Takes advantage of Microsoft products like Excel, Access, and Word. 
  * Costs absolutely nothing to use or distribute. The ProgrammerA's Lab is 100% free.
