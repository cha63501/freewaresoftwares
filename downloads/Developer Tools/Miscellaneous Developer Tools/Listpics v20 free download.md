This program will create an HTML file called PICLIST.HTM containing a list of
all the graphic files in a directory, sorted in alphabetic order. You can then
load this generated HTM file into a web browser to view all the graphics. This
is useful when you want to select from a large number of graphics you have
collected. It is also an ideal tool for viewing animated Gifs.
