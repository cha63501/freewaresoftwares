**Publisher's Description**  
  

OpenMocha is an open source Javascript website application server and
development framework. Quick soft-coding and clean hard-coding in Javascript
on the client-side AND the server-side.

The goal of OpenMocha is to maximize the fun and productivity of Javascript
development by blending the gap between browser and server based scripting.

With OpenMocha, a new project can be quickly soft-coded by creating custom
Mocha Objects using the web browser. As the project matures, these Mocha
Objects can be re-factored and hard-coded in separate code files. The two
approaches can be mixed at any time, patching hard-coded applications through
soft-coding even during runtime.

OpenMocha intends to stretch and scale between fast all-in-one deployment and
complex integration in best-of-breed environments.
