Host Evaluator helps you make more informed decisions on where your website should be hosted. 

Finding good hosting is not an easy task. There are tens of thousands of web hosts out there and a large majority are poorly run and unreliable. It is not unusual for a webmaster to change hosts many times in as many months because of server downtime, slow connections, and/or poor tech support and customer service.

Finally there is a way that you can analyze web hosts before you pull out your credit card and make the move. With the Host Evaluator software you can add the web hosting plans you want to compare, and test out the servers of the company who you are potentially going to buy hosting services from.

Using Host Evaluators intuitive interface you can analyze the best hosts based on many of the important attributes that you seek in a good hosting environment. This includes storage space, bandwidth, 12-month cost, e-mail, support, redundancy, features, connection speed and uptime. After this, you can choose which plans you want to compare, weight your attributes according to your needs and the Host Evaluator will generate a table with the best host.

Once you have decided on the host, you can still use the Host Evaluator software to continue to check your new serverA's uptime and speed and alert you if the server goes down at any time!
