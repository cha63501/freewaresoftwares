**Publisher's Description**  
  

Harbor is a POJO Application Server. Nice alternative to complex EJB and IOC
containers. (Java Application + Container = Remote Usage and Central Storage)

One can create a standalone Java application, and drop it into a central
server, for remote clients to use. The client side of the application, now
running remotely can still use the server side of the application, making
server development, game deployment, and biz logic all very easy to develop,
for a network.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
