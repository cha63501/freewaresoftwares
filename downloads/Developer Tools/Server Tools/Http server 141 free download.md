**Publisher's Description**  
  

This HTTP Server is designed to run under 98/NT/2000/XP, you can host a folder
with it and specify the hosting port.

It has features like Directory Browsing and low memory usage during file
transfers. HTTP Server is designed to handle multiple connections. The
application is relatively easy to use and requires very little documentation.

The latest version supports Resume Capability, this means that when a client
is using a browser/grabber to download a file that is able to pause/resume the
download, the HTTP Server will be able to handle the request correctly and
begin sending data at the position the browser/grabber requested. Also a Last-
Modified validator is sent to the browser/grabber so the date and time can be
verified to check whether the file has been changed.
