**Publisher's Description**  
  


BitNami JBoss Stack Native Installer is an easy-to-install environment to develop and deploy JBoss applications. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run versions of Apache, JBoss, MySQL and Java so users can get the environment up and running in minutes after answering a few questions. Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems are supported. 

JBoss is a open-source Java EE-based application server. An important distinction for this class of software is that it not only implements a server that runs on Java, but it actually implements the Java EE part of Java. Because it is Java-based, the JBoss application server operates cross-platform: usable on any operating system that supports Java. JBoss AS was developed by JBoss, now a division of Red Hat.

**WhatA's New in version 7.1.1-1:**

  * Updated JDK to 1.6.0_33 
  * Updated MySQl to 5.5.21 
  * Change JBoss server to run as 'jboss' user when it is installed as root
