**Publisher's Description**  
  

Server Tester is a small and easy to use application that pings websites,
servers or IP addresses to test for a response. The application logs all
activity in W3C standard log files and can send an email if a server is
considered to be unreachable after a few attempts. The application can be
minimised to the system tray where an icon easily notifies the user if any
errors or warnings have been generated.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
