**Publisher's Description**  
  


This HTTP Server is designed to run under 98/NT/2000/XP, you can host a folder with it and specify the hosting port. 

It has features like Directory Browsing and low memory usage during file transfers. HTTP Server is designed to handle multiple connections. The application is relatively easy to use and requires very little documentation.

The latest version supports Resume Capability, this means that when a client is using a browser/grabber to download a file that is able to pause/resume the download, the HTTP Server will be able to handle the request correctly and begin sending data at the position the browser/grabber requested. Also a Last-Modified validator is sent to the browser/grabber so the date and time can be verified to check whether the file has been changed.
