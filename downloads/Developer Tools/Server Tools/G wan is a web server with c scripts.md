**Publisher's Description**  
  


G-WAN (106 KB) is 5x faster than IIS+ASP.Net! 

G-WAN is a web server, with a small-footprint (50 KB). It supports GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE and OPTIONS, conditional requests and directory listings. G-WAN is also provably safer (speed is a side-effect of good designs).

G-WAN is an application server (hence the other 50 KBs). Its C servlets (that you just A'edit & playA') are as fast as static contents (benchmark the A'hello.cA' servlet sample against a Perl, PHP, Java or ASP.Net equivalent).

Why use C rather than a A'saferA' language for G-WAN servlets?

  1. Perl, PHP, Java, ASP.Net and G-WAN are written in C, for a reason. 
  2. If you already know C, how many languages do you need to learn? 
  3. C can be as safe as any other language (see the A'crash.cA' servlet). 
The best way to understand G-WANA's capabilities is to play with it!
