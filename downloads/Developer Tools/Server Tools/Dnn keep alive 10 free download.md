**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Renegade DNN Keep Alive allows you TRULY keep your new DotNetNuke web site
alive and running so that it loads fast for everyone.

The problem with the KeepAlive.aspx is that if anything goes wrong, your
browser wonA't keep reloading it. So your ASP.NET application gets eaten by
the garbage collector and needs to reload later.

However, with the Renegade DNN Keep Alive, if there are any errors, it will
simply reload it every minute for you until it is alive.

Just type in the URL to your DotNetNuke portal KeepAlive.aspx file, and press
enter. Minimize it to the system tray, and forget about it.

ItA's that easy.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
