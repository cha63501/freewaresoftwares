**Publisher's Description**  
  

Implementing sitemaps is a good choice if you want your website to rank higher
as GoogleA's coverage of the web grows. Because Google indexes websites in
cycles, it would previously have been normal for updated pages to be indexed
after anything up to a few days. By making a Google Sitemap-formatted file
available on your Web server, you will be making sure that your entire website
is indexed at one go.

Diadematus for Google is a premium sitemap application made by MediaCET.
Diadematus is used to spider websites and build a complete XML sitemap index
based on the Google recommendations, so that it can be read and indexed by the
Google search engine.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
nloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows
XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
