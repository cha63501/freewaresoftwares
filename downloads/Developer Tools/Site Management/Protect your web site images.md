**Publisher's Description**  
  


Protect your images. Your images can only be seen from your web site. Secure Image uses image encryption with Domain Lock to prevent direct saving, right mouse saving, direct downloading and bandwidth theft. Image encryption protects the image that can be retrieved from the Temporary Internet Folder and cache. Options include targeted hyperlink on the image, status bar and image messages with optional border frames. 

Registration keys can be obtained by registering online. Registration is free but a web site address must be given to enable the Domain Lock. V2.2 is free for non-commercial use.
