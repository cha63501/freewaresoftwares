**Publisher's Description**  
  

Manage your Web-Site banner-advertising the free, easy and flexible way!
EasyBanMan works with IIS5 and IIS6 as a ASP Component DLL, managed through a
Windows application. EasyBanMan is a ASP Web Component that will allow web
developers to add rotating banner advertising for an unlimited amount of
banners and sites, using just the one component and one database. EasyBan has
two Rotation Modes one is to show random but equally-spread (a banner is not
re-shown until all others under its category have already been displayed) and
the other is to just randomly show a banner, regardless of how many times it
has been shown.
