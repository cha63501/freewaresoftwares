**Publisher's Description**  
  


netChimes is a must for anyone who runs a website! A hybrid of a webcounter and an instant messenger, netChimes receives messages from your server, not your friends. An alert message is sent whenever a user accesses a netChimes-enabled page (using PHP), and plays a notification sound on your desktop. 

netChimes allows you to create a separate alert for every page, and can even be set up to notify you of image or file downloads.
