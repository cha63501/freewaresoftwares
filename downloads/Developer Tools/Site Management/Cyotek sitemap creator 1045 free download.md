**Publisher's Description**  
  

Sitemaps make it easy to browse entire websites no matter how many pages they
contain. Search engines also use them to index websites. However, creating a
site map can be daunting unless you use a suitable program to automate the
task. Cyotek Sitemap Creator is a special application that enables you to
create sitemaps of either portions of or entire websites with relative ease.

You use simple rules to configure how the free sitemap creator scans websites.
For example, you may download a website address to include in the sitemap or
exclude some portions of a website. You can also pre-define usernames and
passwords if there are protected sections of a website. Alternatively, you may
have the application prompt for credentials automatically during the scanning
process.

You may also configure how you want a website to be crawled. You can configure
default documents, user agent strings and domain aliases among others. You
will use regular expressions to perform different tasks.

The application lets you see a visual diagram of the website you are working
on and customize it if you want. You can then export the diagram in image
format. You will also get a report of the scan results, which will help you to
determine if there are any errors. In addition, you will get a preview of the
sitemap to be created to ensure everything is alright.

The free sitemap creator allows you to notify search engines about the updated
sitemap.
