Racing Turtle FTP is a next generation FTP client, being designed and created this year by Pmycro Computing (led by Peter Kotwicz) The software contains plenty of features found in no other program while keeping a user friendly and simple interface. 

Some of its most innovative features:  
Color Coding. The file listings are color coded according to their existance on both the server and the hard drive and which is newer. Racing Turtle FTP uses an update button to transfer files. It follows your mouse as you select files and directories to be transferred The software allows you to start your transfers once youA've selected all the files to be transferred, so that you can work on different work as the program is transferring. The program also starts transferring after two minutes of inactivity. You can stop a transfer whenever you want. None of your files will be corrupted as the program stores all of the files which need to be transferred. RacingTurtle FTP gives you the option of automatically transferring files which are newer from your base directory on. All you need to activate this command, is well... login. 

Being both freeware and open source, the program is constantly evolving, and therefore will be always at the peek of current technology. It is therefore your responsability to report any bugs you come accross to RacingTurtle software support!
