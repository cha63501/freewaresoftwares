**Publisher's Description**  
  

Joomla! is a powerful Open Source Content Management System for building
professional web sites easily. It is often the system of choice for small
business or home users who want a professional looking site thatA's simple to
deploy and use. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site as well,
empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs.

Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software.
For a start, itA's not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody,
and anybody can develop it further. Similarly to the Firefox browser, the core
system can be extended via easily installable add-ons authored by the
developer community.

The comprehensive internationalization of Joomla! 1.5.x supports right to left
languages (e.g. Hebrew or Arab) and extended character sets. Dozens of
language packs can be separately downloaded.

**WhatA's New in version 1.5.11:**

  * Minor bug and security fixes.
