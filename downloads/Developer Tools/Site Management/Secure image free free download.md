**Publisher's Description**  
  

Protect your images. Your images can only be seen from your web site. Secure
Image uses image encryption with Domain Lock to prevent direct saving, right
mouse saving, direct downloading and bandwidth theft. Image encryption
protects the image that can be retrieved from the Temporary Internet Folder
and cache. Options include targeted hyperlink on the image, status bar and
image messages with optional border frames.

Registration keys can be obtained by registering online. Registration is free
but a web site address must be given to enable the Domain Lock. V2.2 is free
for non-commercial use.
