**Publisher's Description**  
  


AMPPS is a stack of Apache, PHP, MySQL, Perl & Python. AMPPS enables you to focus more on using applications rather than maintaining them. 

With AMPPS you can create a website by installing any of the 215 Apps, customizing it, and then simply publishing it on the internet via a wide choice of hosting service providers. Softaculous AMPPS helps you deploy Apps on your server. We have covered a wide array of Categories so that everyone could find the required application one would need to power their business. 

AMPPS is one of the best WAMPPP stacks you can get with so many preconfigured Apps. You can create multiple MySQL databases and manage them easily with phpMyAdmin. AMPPS also has a SQLite Manager for managing SQLite databases. You can deploy various Apps either on your localhost or on your network. 

AMPPS allows you to configure these domains (localhost or your network) very easily. If you want an App e.g. a wiki for your local office intranet, you can easily do that with AMPPS. You can deploy Apps across multiple domains you own, by the click of a button. 

AMPPS enables you to deploy various Apps like forums, blogs, wikis, CMS, galleries by the click of a button. You can concentrate more on your business and less on deploying these Apps. You can also see the Demos of various Apps as well as Ratings and Reviews of the many users who have used these apps before.
