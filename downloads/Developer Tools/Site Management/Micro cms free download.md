**Publisher's Description**  
  

Micro CMS is the only program available that combines a search-engine-friendly
WYSIWYG with a simple, AJAX-based content management system, making the
management of your static web site incredibly easy and fast.

HereA's how a typical session would work:

1) The administrator logs in via a simple form.

2) They visit the page where they have content the need to change.

3) They click a button that is visible only to administrators, and without
even having to refresh the page, theyA're offered a fully functional WYSIWIG
to edit their content. Once they get done editing the content, they click a
save button. Again, no page refreshing is needed, so it works super-fast!

Micro CMS comes with an installer program to make installation easy for just
about anyone. You just need a hosting account with PHP and a MySQL database,
and youA're set!
