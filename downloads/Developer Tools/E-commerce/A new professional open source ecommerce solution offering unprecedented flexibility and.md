**Publisher's Description**  
  


Magento was designed with the notion that each eCommerce implementation has to be unique since no two businesses are alike. MagentoA's modular architecture puts the control back in the hands of the online merchant and places no constraints on business processes and flow. 

**Single Page Checkout**

MagentoA's Single Page Checkout keeps your customersA' order information visible at all times and enables them to review and edit their order without leaving the checkout process. Hence, reducing the chances that customers would abandon the cart and increasing conversion rates. 

**Ship to Multiple Addresses**

With MagentoA's Ship to Multiple Addresses feature your customerA's shopping experience is greatly enhanced. They can now complete their entire Xmas shopping list in one single transaction and ship to multiple destinations.

**Advanced Marketing Tools**

Magento offers advanced catalog and shopping cart price-rules which enable Store Owners to create a wide array of promotions from store-wide markdowns to targeted coupons.

**SEO Features**

Magento is 100% SEO friendly and includes a variety of features to enhance your storeA's positioning including built-in natural search optimization, easily-editable metadata, and social shopping tools such as reviews and tags that encourage dynamic product-related content.
