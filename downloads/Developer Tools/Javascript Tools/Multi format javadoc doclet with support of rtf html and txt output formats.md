**Publisher's Description**  
  


DocFlex/Doclet is a template-driven multi-format Javadoc doclet. It is a freeware edition of DocFlex/Javadoc, which is the rapid doclet development tool. DocFlex/Doclet can be used a free interpreter of custom DocFlex/Javadoc templates, which implement particular doclets. In addition, DocFlex/Doc includes the Standard Template Set, which makes it simply a ready-to-use multi-format doclet. 

**Features:**

  * Full support of new Java 5.0 language features: Generic Types, Enums, Annotations. 
  * Simultaneous support of Java 1.4 and Java 5. 
  * The Standard Template Set included in the software allows instant generation of framed HTML JavaDoc similar to that generated by the standard Javadoc doclet, the same documentation packed into a single HTML file, the exceptional quality RTF JavaDoc with the correct rendering of HTML tags embedded in Java comments (including insertion of images specified with A'imgA' tags). 
  * The plain text (TXT) output is supported as well, which may be used for various utilizations of Java code info provided by Doclet API (e.g. generation of XML files). 
  * It is also possible to exclude from the result documentation any mentioning of classes, fields and methods marked with the specified tags or annotations. This gives you incredible flexibility over how you can document your Java project! 
  * Besides specifying all settings using options on the Javadoc command line, DocFlex/Doclet provides a user-friendly Doclet GUI, where you can assign the same settings in special inspector dialogs, start the generation, track its progress and stop it at any moment (when needed). Once the generation is finished (or cancelled), you can start it again with different settings or a new template set. This, in effect, allows changing your doclet on the fly. You wonA't need to restart the whole Javadoc. All the memory representation of your Java project provided via the Doclet API will remain the same.
