**Publisher's Description**  
  


This script turns an ordinary UL list into a drill down style menu, adding a new dimension to the conventional drop down menu. You can customize which level should be shown by default, whether to remember the last shown level when the page reloads, plus the speed of the "drilling" animation. And to ensure the user doesnA't get lost with all this drilling, the script can optionally display "breadcrumb" links that reflect the current level the user is at.
