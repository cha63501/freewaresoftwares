**Publisher's Description**  
  

Colorblind Assistant is free software that instantly picks the color from the
mouse pointer, providing you with a written name of the color, as well as
other useful data such as RGB values and bar graphs, brightness and
saturation. The software also has a zoom pane for fine pixel detection, and
sits nicely in your desktop tray when not in use.

Colorblind Assistant runs in a small 192x128 window that you can easily use
alongside graphics programs, applications, games, video-editing software and
movie players. The pixel data updates in real-time, so use with animations and
movies is just as easy as still images.

The software is spyware/advertising free and uses minimal memory and
resources.
