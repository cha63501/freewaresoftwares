**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Picker is a very small and simple color picker utility. It sits at the top
of the screen where it is always visible. The Picker shows the proximity area
of the mouse pointer with 2x zoom for precise pointer positioning. The window
of The Picker is small that it wonA't interfere with your work area. You no
more need to work with a color picker whose window itself takes up half of
your screen.

The Picker can show the color code in three formats: RGB color code, Long
color code & Hex color code. This means that The Picker can be used for
picking colors for absolutely any purpose.

The Picker does not need any installation - just run the file directly. It has
been developed completely using Win32 API which allows The Picker to run on a
really low memory footprint. You will certainly never find a color picker
utility this easy to use!
