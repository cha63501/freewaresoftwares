**Publisher's Description**  
  


Simple program to generate a colour using 3 sliders that represent RGB (Red, Green and Blue), and can generate either the RGB, HEX or actual colour conversion function for Borland Delphi and MSVB (itA's the same for them both). 

It also has the feature of randomly generating a colour, and allowing you to pick a colour from anywhere on the screen (providing the application it self has focus) from under your mouse. Much like how it is done in Adobe Photoshop, but can be taken from anything displayed on the entire screen.

This is currently the beta, of what is to be the first real release (2.0B at this stage as itA's a fairly simple program).
