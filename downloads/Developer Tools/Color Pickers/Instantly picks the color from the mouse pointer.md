**Publisher's Description**  
  


Colorblind Assistant is free software that instantly picks the color from the mouse pointer, providing you with a written name of the color, as well as other useful data such as RGB values and bar graphs, brightness and saturation. The software also has a zoom pane for fine pixel detection, and sits nicely in your desktop tray when not in use. 

Colorblind Assistant runs in a small 192x128 window that you can easily use alongside graphics programs, applications, games, video-editing software and movie players. The pixel data updates in real-time, so use with animations and movies is just as easy as still images.

The software is spyware/advertising free and uses minimal memory and resources.
