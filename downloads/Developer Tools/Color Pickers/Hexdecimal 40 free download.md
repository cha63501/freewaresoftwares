**Publisher's Description**  
  

Hexdecimal is a small, simple and reliable application that provides a simple
way of grabbing any colour on the screen and converting it to a hexadecimal
colour string. It also has options to change colours by RGB, HSL and CMYK
values, and create+save palettes of colours using a point-and-click interface.

Colours can be copied in a variety of formats, with the default options
including the #RRGGBB, (red, green, blue) and 0xRRGGBB formats, as well as
basic colour naming. All colour names and copy formats can be changed by
modifying basic text files if needed.

The program is designed to to have minimal install / uninstall, be highly
customisable and use few resources while running. Installing is a case of
unpacking the files into a directory, and uninstalling is a case of deleting
that directory. No mess, no fuss.
