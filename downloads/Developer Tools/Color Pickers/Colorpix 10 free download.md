**Publisher's Description**  
  

ColorPix is a useful little color picker that grabs the pixel under your mouse
and transforms it into a number of different color formats.

You can use the built-in magnifier to zoom in on your screen, click on a color
value to copy it directly to the clipboard, and even keep ColorPix on top of
all other apps and out of the way.

Best of all, thereA's nothing to install - just download the tiny app and off
you go.
