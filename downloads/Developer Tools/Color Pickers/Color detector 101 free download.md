Do you ever see a nice color used on a Web site, picture, graphic,
application, and want to know the RGB or the HTML hex code of that color?
Color Detector allows you to find out just that. Simply point the mouse cursor
anywhere on the screen, and the application will tell you: the RGB code, the
HTML hex code, and the name of the color in plain English, of the pixel where
the mouse is pointing. It can also copy the HTML hex code to the clipboard.
