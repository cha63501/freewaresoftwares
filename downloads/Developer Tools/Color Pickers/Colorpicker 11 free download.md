**Publisher's Description**  
  

ColorPicker allows you to easily pick a color from anywhere on the screen by
simply pointing to the color with the cursor, the RGB value of which you want
to insert in your html script or source code.

There are multiple pre-defined formats the color at the mouse cursorA's
location is displayed, such as HTML, RGB, hex, decimal. Further user-defined
display formats can be added easily.

Pressing a configurable hotkey anywhere - no matter which application you are
currently working with - causes ColorPicker to copy the currently displayed
color into the clipboard. The copied color value then can be pasted into your
editor.

There is a color palette available, if are looking for a specific color.
