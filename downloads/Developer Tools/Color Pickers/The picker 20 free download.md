**Publisher's Description**  
  

Welcome to the sparkling new version of The Picker - version 2.0! The Picker
is a very small and simple color picker utility. It sits at the top of the
screen where it is always visible but still totally unobtrusive. The window of
The Picker is so small that it wonA't interfere with your work area. You no
more need to work with a color picker whose window itself takes up half of
your screen. The PickerA's main window shows the proximity area of the mouse
pointer with 2x zoom.

This new version of The Picker also has a 4x zoom window which moves along
with your mouse pointer. This window also shows the color code, the X,Y
position of the mouse and the HotKeys to the current color code and pause The
Picker. Yes, you also get HotKeys in this version. And if youA're still
wondering, this version is also portable - it does not need any installation -
just run the file directly. It has been developed completely using Win32 API
which allows The Picker to run on a really low memory footprint.

The Picker can show the color code in three formats: RGB color code, Long
color code & Hex color code. This means that The Picker can be used for
picking colors for absolutely any purpose.

And as all of software at Raunak.info, The Picker is also free!
