**Publisher's Description**  
  

AWStats is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web,
streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works
as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log
contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be
able to process large log files, often and quickly.

It can analyze log files from all major server tools like Apache log files
(NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C
log format) and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail
servers and some ftp servers.

AWStats is a free software distributed under the GNU General Public License.

As AWStats works from the command line but also as a CGI, it can work with all
web hosting providers which allow Perl, CGI and log access.
