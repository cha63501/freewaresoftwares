**Publisher's Description**  
  

Web Statistics Montage is a free tool that compiles web statistics from
multiple web sites and sends them to you in an easy-to-read, easy-to-compare
format without having to log in anywhere! Just set up a simple configuration
file, upload the files to your site and youA're done.

Web Statistics Montage gathers statistics like search engine spider activity,
the PageRank of each of your sites, the unique visitors to your site over the
last 3 months, what keywords were used to get to your site since that last
report was generated, and much, much more!

Web Statistics Montage requires that you have a web hosting account that uses
the cPanel control panel with AWStats installed. Web Statistics Montage also
uses a few MySQL database tables. Installation is very easy.
