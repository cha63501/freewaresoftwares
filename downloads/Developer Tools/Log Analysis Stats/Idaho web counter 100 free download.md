**Publisher's Description**  
  

Idaho-Web-Counter is a way to add counters to your Web site. Click on the
counter style you want and the program will copy the code you need to your
clipboard. Paste the code into your Web page and youA're done. It allows you
to count the number of times a page was viewed, or if you have access to a
server-side scripting language like PHP or ASP you can count just unique
visitors. You can even set the starting number for the counter if youA're
moving over from another counter service.
