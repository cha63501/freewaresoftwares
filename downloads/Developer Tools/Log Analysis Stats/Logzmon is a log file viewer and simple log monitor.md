**Publisher's Description**  
  


LogzMon is a tool to view and monitor log files over the internet or within an intranet. You no longer need to transfer log files thru FTP, RCPY, etc. 

Although LogzMon is not a replacement for professional monitoring software, it is well suited to monitor small or medium size web sites remotely.

The software is written in PHP and runs on the web server machine. No database or other additional software is needed. On the client side, a standard web browser supporting JavaScript and AJAX technology is necessary. Most modern browsers can be used.

**Features Include:**

  * Rule based text highlighting, 
  * Monitor (auto-refresh) mode,
  * Window sizing (3 predefined sizes),
  * Rule based issueing of alert messages in auto-refresh mode.

LogzMon has been tested on Unix / Linux and Windows platforms.
