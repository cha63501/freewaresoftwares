Web Statistics Montage is a free tool that compiles web statistics from multiple web sites and sends them to you in an easy-to-read, easy-to-compare format without having to log in anywhere! Just set up a simple configuration file, upload the files to your site and youA're done. 

Web Statistics Montage gathers statistics like search engine spider activity, the PageRank of each of your sites, the unique visitors to your site over the last 3 months, what keywords were used to get to your site since that last report was generated, and much, much more!

Web Statistics Montage requires that you have a web hosting account that uses the cPanel control panel with AWStats installed. Web Statistics Montage also uses a few MySQL database tables. Installation is very easy.
