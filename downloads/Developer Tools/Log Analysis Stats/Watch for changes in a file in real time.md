**Publisher's Description**  
  


The main purpose of this software is to watch in real-time the changes to a file. It is intended to watch a text file but can be used with any file on disk. The necessity arises from a typical web development under the Windows operating system (Apache Web server + PHP + some HTML editing software). The errors committed in development are accurately shown by the PHP interpreter in the Apache error log, but the user access to this file is rather complicated
