**Publisher's Description**  
  

XSolvo html2xml is a program that converts HTML data to XML.

The HTML format is a loose format that makes it quite a difficulty in parsing
and processing data from HTML files. It is much simpler to have it in XML
instead. With the file in XML you can use common utilities and tools to
process the data.

So, get rid of the HTML parsing problem with html2xml and convert your HTML
pages to XML. Then you can process it as you want with XML parsers, XSLT, etc.

**New in version 1.2**

  * Conversion from more than 40 character tables to unicode
  * A command line version of the program for batch conversion
  * Improved synchronization between source and target views in GUI
  * Changed installation program to NSIS
