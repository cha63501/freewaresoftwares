The rObjects XML Editor is a tool you can use to edit any XML file. XMLEdit
can be customized with profiles specific to the schema you are editing.
XMLEdit profiles map your XML data into easy-to-use property grids. Since
XMLEditA's profiles and property grid definitions are all XML based, it can be
used to customize itself! XMLEdit also has convenient features to help you
build a custom editor on-the-fly.

**Features:**

  * Tree / property grid representation of XML data 
  * Customizable editor profiles and property grids 
  * Tree manipulation features including indent, outdent, re-order 
  * Cut-and-paste tree data and/or XML 
  * Includes profiles for editing its own profiles and property grids (self-customization)
