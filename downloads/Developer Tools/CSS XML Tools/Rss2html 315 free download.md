A free PHP script, converts RSS feeds to HTML. The rss2html.php script allows
webmasters to display RSS feeds on their website. RSS or Really Simple
Syndication, as it is commonly known, is a technology that gives webmasters
the ability to to easily distribute and publish syndicated content on the
Internet. Most webmasters understand the potential benefits of making RSS
feeds available for viewing in a web browser. FeedForAllA's new rss2html.php
script allows users to create webpages that will always display the most
current information from the RSS feed, and because the resulting page is pure
HTML, it will be in a format friendly to search engine robots. Using
rss2html.php webmasters can customize the format and look of the web page
created from the feed. The RSS feedA's contents can easily be integrated into
an existing websiteA's theme. The rss2html.php script parses the RSS file,
extracts the pertinent information, formats it, and serves it up as regular
HTML. The rss2html.php script runs on any webserver that can run PHP scripts,
and it support feeds in the RSS 2.0, .93, .92, .91, or .90, 1.0 format.
