**Publisher's Description**  
  

SVERDYSH Publishing House software offers solutions to writers, publishes
books free of charge and immediately. It is a converter from .txt file format
to .exe file format.

It allows to publish a book immediately, literally in seconds. Any number of
illustrations and photos in any image formats can be attached to the book, and
can be viewed with the help of an image viewer which is a part of the program.

How it works in nutshell?

First, you should prepare a copy of your manuscript in .txt format, Unicode of
UTF- 8. Once this text is compiled, it becomes a standalone executable, which
implies that it can be used everywhere, just click on the icon of the exe file
and it is opened.

Such EXEs (otherwise called binary files) can be distributed or sold with no
restrictions. The compilation process creates an executable file.

The very procedure of publishing is extremely simple. For example the
manuscript is called, My Memoirs.txt. Then the program, after a couple of
mouse clicks, will produce a copy of your book as an .exe file, bearing the
same name as manuscript, e.g. My Memoirs.exe. This .exe file is supplied with
an icon of course, which you can change for your own custom icon, if you wish.

SVERDYSH Publishing House is absolutely FREE, money is not involved at all. It
is self-explanatory, intuitive and very simple to use.
