**Publisher's Description**  
  


From .jpg or .png images taken in a folder, portPholio creates javascript code to display mini-galleries with thumbnails. Size and orientation of the thumbnails are calculated according to the client screen size, the number of images and their orientation (all landscape, all portrait or mixed). 

PortPholio comes in an unique executable file. No entry in the register, no extra system files such as .dll or .Active-X. PortPholio is written with Lazarus, an outstanding free Pascal development environment for Windows, Linux and Mac-OS.
