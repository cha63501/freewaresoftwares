Creator Thumbs for HTML is a useful and free program that allows you to create
thumbnails and scaled copies of all your images. With Easy Thumbnails, you can

images and adjust contrast, brightness, sharpness, and other attributes.

Thumbnails can be created in any existing folder or a new folder, and you can
identify them clearly by adding a prefix or suffix to their names. Easy

possible results. The program supports right-click commands and command-line
switches for generating thumbnails seamlessly from other programs or within
