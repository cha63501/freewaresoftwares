Easy Thumbnails is a handy freeware utility for creating accurate thumbnail images and scaled-down/up copies from a wide range of popular picture formats. 

An elegant interface makes it a snap to find your images and select them for processing individually, in groups, or in whole folders, using a simple file selector and built-in image viewer. You can use slider controls to rotate images and adjust their contrast, brightness, sharpness and quality, and check out the results with a convenient built-in viewer. Thumbnails can be created in any existing folder or a new folder, and you can identify them clearly by adding a prefix or suffix to their titles. 

If youA're an image-processing enthusiast, youA'll enjoy having a choice of nine resampling algorithms for the best possible results. You can convert small batches of images inside Windows Explorer from the File menu or with a right-click of the mouse, display thumbnails in your browser, and even take advantage of command-line switches to generate thumbnails seamlessly from other programs. 

You can also save your thumbnails to a Web page using a HTML template that you can easily customize to create your own layouts, and thereA's helpful documentation that includes full instructions and some useful tips. Easy Thumbnails is a genuine freeware product that will not annoy you with advertising, intrusive spyware components or nag screens. It comes from Fookes Software, developers of the award-winning NoteTab text editors and other high-quality applications.
