YoPoW stands for: Your Photos on the Web. 

YoPoW provides an easy to use step-by-step interface that lets you create a Web Album from your image collection(s).

Simply select the folder that contains the images you want to publish or browse through your computer and select them individually.

Or use the built in Wizard.

The used images are stored in a different folder, so your original images are not altered at all.

YoPoW renders the album pages, thumbnails including various effects, after specifying layout, fonts, font-sizes, font-colors, borders, border-colors, colors, titles, descriptions, navigation buttons and much more.

No need of learning difficult template languages. Select the colors, fonts, sizes and so on and YoPoW generates the code for you.

YoPoW features a preview of the thumbnails and your Web Album and allows you to view the HTML output, as well as the CSS code.

YoPoW also supports projects, allowing you to save your work to continue later or reuse it for other jobs.

You may use YoPowA's FTP client to upload (or send or post) your Album files to your website.

YoPoW is a card ware Web Album Creator.
