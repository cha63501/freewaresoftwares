**Publisher's Description**  
  


This simplifies the automatic generation of a list of MID, MP3, or WMA music files in the same folder as the program, all as with active links in Tune List.htm for uploading. You can change the sample headings to choice. A warning is provided reminding of copyright restrictions on many MP3 and WMA music tracks. This HTML Tune.exe can be removed from the Music folder once it has created HTML Heads.txt and Tune List.htm.
