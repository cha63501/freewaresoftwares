**Publisher's Description**  
  


Web-O-Rama is a versatile HTML editing program for Windows provided as a free alternative (for non-commercial use) to overpriced shareware editors. It has an uncluttered interface and a variety of useful features, including intuitive dialogs for adding images, tables, links, lists, sounds, forms, scrolling text, hex values, special characters, frames, body and font attributes, and more. A comprehensive Tag List contains definitions of commonly used HTML tags and their attributes. Templates, drop-down menus, multiple toolbars, tag coloring, and user-configurable buttons aide both beginning and advanced HTML authors. Files of any size can be opened, edited, and saved. New features include support for opening, searching, and saving multiple files, importing and exporting data among dialogs, and major improvements to all aspects of the program.
