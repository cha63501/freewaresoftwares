**Publisher's Description**  
  

Wizzypage is a w.y.s.i.w.y.g (what you see is what you get) web page design
utility. It was born out of a frustration with bloated web page design
applications that try to automate too much of the smaller details of the web
page creation process.

Wizzypage provides the means to design Web page layouts while leaving any
advanced scripting or detailed formatting to the user.

Wizzypage allows the user to add, position, and edit content "areas" on a Web
page using a series of mouse-click activated popup menus. These areas can then
be dragged around and resized on the design surface to explore alternate
layouts.

WizzypageA's text editor automates basic html coding chores like font and
paragraph formatting or the assignment of background colors and images. Even
without knowing anything about html coding, a Wizzypage user can create fairly
complex and fully functional Web pages in a minimal amount of time.
