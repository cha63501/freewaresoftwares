**Publisher's Description**  
  


Wizzypage is a w.y.s.i.w.y.g (what you see is what you get) web page design utility. It was born out of a frustration with bloated web page design applications that try to automate too much of the smaller details of the web page creation process. 

Wizzypage provides the means to design Web page layouts while leaving any advanced scripting or detailed formatting to the user. 

Wizzypage allows the user to add, position, and edit content "areas" on a Web page using a series of mouse-click activated popup menus. These areas can then be dragged around and resized on the design surface to explore alternate layouts. 

WizzypageA's text editor automates basic html coding chores like font and paragraph formatting or the assignment of background colors and images. Even without knowing anything about html coding, a Wizzypage user can create fairly complex and fully functional Web pages in a minimal amount of time.
