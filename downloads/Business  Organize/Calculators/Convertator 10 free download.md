**Publisher's Description**  
  

Convertator, the converting calculator, allows full equations that may include
units to be entered as text. The result of these equations may have the base
or units changed. A history of the equations and results is kept so that they
may be reused.

Convertator bases include not only Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal,
but also Dotted Decimal, ASCII, and Unicode. Constants, including compound
Constants such as 32ft/sec/sec, and Equations, such as the volume of a sphere
and the conversion between Fahrenheit and Centigrade, are included. A unique
feature is the capability to create custom Units, Constants, and Equations.
