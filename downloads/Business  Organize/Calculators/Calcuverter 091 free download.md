**Publisher's Description**  
  

Calcuverter is a calculator and unit converter in one. Furthermore, you can
enter queries in plain English. Normal desktop calculators always seemed
counter-intuitive to me. Why emulate the limited interface (ie a numeric pad)
of a pocket calculator, when youAve got the power of a desktop computer and
keyboard at your finger tips.

This is a very simple interface, with a lot of hidden power. It uses the
google calculator as its engine, which means that it can do complex
calculations and unit conversions. If the calculation is a simple mathematical
expression, the linux version will use the bc program, rather than going
online.

**Features:**

  * Simple interface; 
  * Mathematic calculations; 
  * Unit conversion; 
  * Currency conversion; 
  * Plain English query entry; 
  * Syntax checking 
  * Query history 
  * Clipboard support
