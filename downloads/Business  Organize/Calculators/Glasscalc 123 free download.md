**Publisher's Description**  
  

GlassCalc is a simple calculator with extensive support for mathematical
expressions. Instead of using buttons, it uses a text input and keeps a full
history of expressions and results. Syntax shortcuts and the layout of the
interface are designed to make entering calculations and getting results as
simple and quick as possible. GlassCalc also has full support for user-defined
functions and variables.

**Features:**

  * Complex mathematical equations in a format very similar to Microsoft Excel
  * Degree and radian trigonometric modes
  * Comprehensive list of default functions. See the screenshots at the top of [this page](http://chaosinacan.com/software/glasscalc) for a full list.
  * User variables: `x=4+1` sets x to 5. `unset x` deletes x
  * User functions: `f(x)=x^2+1` creates a new function f with one argument. `unset f()` deletes it.
  * Coefficients: `4x^2` is evaluated as `4*x^2`
  * Solving equations: `solve x 1? x^2+3x-10 = 4` solves `x2+3x-10=4` for x with an initial guess of 1.
  * Supports input and output in any base from 2 to 36.
  * User variables, functions, and calculation history can be remembered when closing GlassCalc and are restored when reopening the program.
  * Lists of variables and functions can be saved to a text file and recalled later.
  *   * Automatic updates, so you will always have the latest version!
  * Syntax highlighting and brace matching to make it easier to write complex expressions.

**System Requirements:**

GlassCalc requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and Windows XP or greater.
(Transparency effects only appear on Vista and Windows 7 with Aero turned on)
It may run on a version of Windows earlier than XP, but has not been tested.
GlassCalc also requires the Visual C++ 2005 libraries. Both .NET 4.0 and the
VC++ libraries will be installed automatically with the program if needed.

If you already have them installed, a much smaller download is available from
the [program homepage](http://chaosinacan.com/software/glasscalc).
