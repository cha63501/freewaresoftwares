**Publisher's Description**  
  

Are you on track for a happy, financially secure retirement? Here are two
quick "rules of thumb" you can use.  
  
(a) When you are ready to retire your nest egg should be at least 10 times
your current annual income. (Take your current annual income and add a zero --
thatA's your minimum target nest egg balance to begin a comfortable
retirement).  
  
(b) By the time you reach age 40, the balance in your nest egg should roughly
equal your annual income at age 40. (If your annual gross income is $60,000,
you should have at least that amount in your retirement account by age 40).  
  
But the best way to determine how much you need to retire is by using a
financial calculator. This is a great desktop tool for quick calculations to
make sure you are on track. If you donA't know where youA're going, youA'll
never get there!
