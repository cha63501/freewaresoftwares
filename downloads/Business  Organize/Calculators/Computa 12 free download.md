**Publisher's Description**  
  

ComPuta does much more than your usual calculator.

In addition to the usual arithmetic calculations, ComPuta can solve your non-
linear equations, find the extrema (local minima and maxima) of your
functions, generate tables of values for your functions, interpolate functions
from data for specific points or in intervals, integrate and differentiate
your functions and solve your first order initial value problems using the
best algorithms.

ComPuta is easy to use, it does what it says it does efficiently and there is
no boring long documentation to read. Of course there are advanced tricks and
options in ComPuta, but you dont have to learn them unless you want to.

ComPuta is small in size, less than 200kb, a single executable and does not
modify your system in any way. You can add comments in your computations and
your tasks are automatically saved so that you can continue from where you
stopped. Best of all ComPuta is freeware.
