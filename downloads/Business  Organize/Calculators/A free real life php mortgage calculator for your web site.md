**Publisher's Description**  
  


Simple mortgage calculators just donA't cut it anymore. Life is just more complex than down payments and interest rates. Real Life Mortgage Calculator is freeware you can add to your site that gives your visitors a much better picture of how much house they can afford than a simple mortgage calculator. It calculates upfront costs, estimates utility costs, and tells you how much youA'll be paying every year in interest until the mortgage is paid off. 

The Calculator grabs over 20 different variables from the visitor through a simple questionaire, then displays an easy-to-read, printable report packed with important information. The form is completely validated with JavaScript and PHP before it is processed. An external stylesheet makes the page a small, quick download.
