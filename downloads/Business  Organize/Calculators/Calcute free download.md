**Publisher's Description**  
  

Calcute is a Free, **Compact** yet **Capable** Calculator. Features: Process
sequences of arbitrarily complex numeric expressions like:

**-log(1+2) * 3% + sin(4 5/6)^7**

Edit previous calculations and **re-calculate**, cut and paste at will. **Save
your work** to a text file (automatic or manual), restore it later.

Compact single-line mode or flexible multi-line mode. Show buttons or hide
them. Separately **adjustable font and button sizes**.

Flexible snap-on screen positioning to your preferred location. Enable/disable
**always-on-top** style. Help file included.

Adjust it to suit your preferences: Change the font. Show or **hide calculator
buttons** used with the mouse; adjust their size as well. Switch the work area
to single line mode so that it looks like a plain desk calculator. Stretch the
window to any size: shrink it down to a **tiny** utility window stashed in a
corner of your screen, or maximize it in multi-line edit mode for complete
editing flexibility. Save the work area contents to a text file. Do this
manually or automatically when you exit the program, reload it the same way to
continue working where you left off.

Past calculations can be modified then recalculated individually.
