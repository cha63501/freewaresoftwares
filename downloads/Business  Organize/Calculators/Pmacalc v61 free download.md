**Publisher's Description**  
  

pmaCalc combines a scientific calculator, binary arithmetic for programmers,
and unit converter in an interesting package. In addition to a fair range of
scientific functions, it has an unusual numeric stack, and a binary mode that
supports decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary arithmetic, with a full
complement of logical operators and bit manipulation instructions.

It has7 lines: hex, oct, dec, bin, ascii, 2A's compl. and roman. Each line is
clickable for new data input. The others immediately reflect that data input
in their respective bases. You can enter expressions by pressing buttons or by
typing them in (itA's advisable to take care with the syntax), and the stack
offers a flexible alternative to the usual memory functions. You can use
fixed, floating and sci. point modes. Other features include a Euro converter
that handles all European Unioncurrencies, 150+ Units and 500+ Convertions.

Free for private use.
