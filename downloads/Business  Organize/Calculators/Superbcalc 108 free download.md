SuperbCalcA is a software tape calculator (also known as "financial
calculator" or "desk calculator" or "adding machine") written in JavaA. With
SuperbCalc calculations are as easy as with your old tape calculator, but with
more advanced features.

You have your little tape of paper that gets written, showing you the full
history of the calculations made, and you can print it with your printer, you
can cut it and also throw it away. But you can also insert comments,
check/uncheck each line, copy & paste a single number or a whole tape into
your preferred word processing or spreadsheet application, and more.

With SuperbCalc you can correct the numbers directly in the tape, and it will
automatically recalculate the whole tape!
