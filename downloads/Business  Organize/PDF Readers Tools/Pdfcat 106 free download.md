**Publisher's Description**  
  

PDFCat is a fast and lightweight catalog management application to keep track
of PDF documents coming in through many possible ways. This is not meant to be
a highly available solution for complex and unified cataloguing. Instead, it
aims to provide a better user experience. The unique feature of this software
is its ability handle documents stored on removable devices.

So far the application is designed to work with Adobe Portable Document Format
(PDF). The reason is popularity and great amount of information available in
this format.
