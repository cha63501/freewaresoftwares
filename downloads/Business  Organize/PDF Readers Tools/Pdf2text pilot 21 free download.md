PDF to text file converter that allows extracting text from a batch of PDF
files. Just select PDF files, click Convert, and you will get text files
containing the resulting texts from the PDF extraction.

PDF2Text Pilot is an open-source tool. Software developers can use the code as
an example of solving a text extraction task. Working from command line is
supported.

With batch processing, you can extract texts from a batch of PDF files to:

  * a corresponding number of files (or exporting the text of each into another text file); 
  * a single file (exporting the text of all PDF files into a single text file).
