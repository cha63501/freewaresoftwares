Although UnityPDF is a free PDF tool, it provides many great features that put it on par with the paid programs. 

Following are the programA's main features:

  * Splitting PDF files 
  * Merging files 
  * Extracting pages 
  * Inserting a PDF file into another 
  * Viewing and removing metadata 
  * Protecting and managing permissions 

**Using UnityPDF**

UnityPDF comes in both installer and portable versions. When we launched the application, it opened instantly, displaying a user interface that was almost bare compared to other PDF tools. However, the simple interface hid many useful features under the hood.

When we added PDF files, the program displayed their page counts, paths and sizes on the left, middle and right respectively. Once we had added the files we wanted, we just needed to select the actions we wanted to perform.

We split PDF files into several one-page files, including files made up of scanned images. We also divided some files into several parts by choosing either the number of parts or maximum sizes we wanted. The ability to divide PDF files into specified sizes can come in handy if you cannot send a file because of size limitations.

Merging different files was also easy. We just added the files we wanted to merge, sorted them in the order we wanted and then clicked the merge button.

The PDF file management tool also comes in handy in protecting your privacy. Metadata can contain sensitive details that you would not like other people to see. You can use the program to view available details, including title, creator, author, producer, creation date and modification date. You can remove these details with one click of the mouse. UnityPDF does not change the original file, but instead it creates another file and adds Ano metadataA to its name.

Whether you want to split, merge, insert PDF files or extract desired pages, UnityPDF works like a breeze. You will complete even large tasks in a matter of seconds. Please note that this is a PDF file management tool, not a PDF reader.

Although the program does not come with a help file, and clicking help redirects to a Web page that is still under development, using it is straightforward.

The free PDF tool requires Windows XP or higher and [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) or higher.
