**Publisher's Description**  
  


DiffPDF can compare two PDF files. It offers two comparison modes: Text and Appearance. 

By default the comparison is of the text on each pair of pages, but comparing the appearance of pages is also supported (for example, if a diagram is changed or if a paragraph is reformatted). 

It is also possible to compare particular pages or page ranges. For example, if there are two versions of a PDF file, one with pages 1-12 and the other with pages 1-13 because of an extra page having been added as page 4, they can be compared by specifying two page ranges, 1-12 for the first and 1-3, 5-13 for the second. This will make DiffPDF compare pages in the pairs (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 6), and so on, to (12, 13). 

**WhatA's New in version 2.1.3:**

  * Minor GUI fixes. 
  * Subtle bug fix by Bryan Huh which _may_ help resolve the bug that affects saving when page ranges are in effect.
