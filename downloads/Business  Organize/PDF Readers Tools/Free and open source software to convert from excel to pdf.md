**Publisher's Description**  
  


Excel to PDF converter is a free and open source application that enables you to create PDF documents from your Excel workbooks. 

Excel to PDF Converter also allows you to easily embed a creative commons license in your PDF file. Excel to PDF Converter is easy to use. Just click the button to save your PDF.

The program is free! It does not cost anything to use (free as in beer), and is also open-source, licensed under the GPL (free as in speech).

Most free PDF conversion utilities lose your hyperlinks during the conversion. After conversion, you end up with blue underlined text, but it is not clickable. Excel to PDF Converter preserves your links and keeps them working in the resulting PDF file. Whether they point to a web page, or internal links to a target cell in the sheet.

Excel to PDF Converter gives you the option of embedding a Creative Commons license in your PDF. Publishing your PDF under a Creative Commons license allows colleagues, bloggers, social media sites and even newspapers to republish your work and create new content based on it as long as they clearly state that you are the creator. This way, your work gets spread around much faster and you retain the credit for it. You can learn more about the Creative Commons at www.creativecommons.org

Excel to PDF Converter is compatible with Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, Vista and Windows 7, as well as Microsoft Excel 2000, XP, 2003 and Excel 2007.
