**Publisher's Description**  
  


If PDF is electronic paper, then pdftk is an electronic staple-remover, hole-punch, binder, secret-decoder-ring, and X-Ray-glasses. Pdftk is a useful tool for handling PDF documents. Every PDF user should have one in the top drawer of his/her desktop. 

**Use it to:**

  * Merge PDF Documents 
  * Split PDF Pages into a New Document 
  * Decrypt Input as Necessary (Password Required) 
  * Encrypt Output as Desired 
  * Burst a PDF Document into Single Pages 
  * Report on PDF Metrics, including Metadata and Bookmarks 
  * Uncompress and Re-Compress Page Streams 
  * Repair Corrupted PDF (Where Possible) 
Pdftk is also an example of how to use a library of Java classes in a stand-alone C++ program. Specifically, it demonstrates how GCJ and CNI allows C++ code to use iTextA's (itext-paulo) Java classes.
