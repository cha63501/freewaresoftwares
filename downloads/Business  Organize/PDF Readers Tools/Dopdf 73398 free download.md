doPDF is a free PDF converter for both personal and commercial use. Using
doPDF you can create searchable PDF files by selecting the "Print" command
from virtually any application. With one click you can convert your Microsoft

doPDF installs itself as a virtual printer driver so after a successful
installation will appear in your Printers and Faxes list. To create PDF files,
you just have to print your documents to the doPDF pdf converter. Open a

Print and select doPDF. It will ask you where to save the PDF file and when
finished, the PDF file will be automatically opened in your default PDF
viewer.
