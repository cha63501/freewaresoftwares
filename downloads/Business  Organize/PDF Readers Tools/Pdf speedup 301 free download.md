**Publisher's Description**  
  

PDF SpeedUp allows you to significantly speed up the time it takes to load
Adobe Reader. If you notice that when the Reader starts it loads many plug-ins
which you may or may not need, this program simply disables the plug-ins and
loads only the absolute necessary ones so the program starts quickly. It
offers several options and you can also manually enable or disable the plug-
ins as needed. PDF SpeedUp works with Acrobat versions 5 through 9. Multi-
lingual interface.

**Features:**

  * Free PDF Tweak Utility for Adobe Acrobat 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Adobe Reader 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
  * Enable or disable the plug-ins as needed 
  * Turn off all Updates features 
  * Disable the splash screen during program startup 
  * Remove the My eBooks folder created in My Documents 
  * Turn off the advertisements for Adobe products in the upper-right corner of the toolbar 
  * Remove PrintMe and Adobe Reader icons 
  * Disable Browser Integration 
  * Disable confirmation dialog when closing Adobe Reader
