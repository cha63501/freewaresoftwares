Although UnityPDF is a free PDF tool, it provides many great features that put
it on par with the paid programs.

Following are the programA's main features:

  * Splitting PDF files 
  * Merging files 
  * Extracting pages 
  * Inserting a PDF file into another 
  * Viewing and removing metadata 
  * Protecting and managing permissions 

**Using UnityPDF**

UnityPDF comes in both installer and portable versions. When we launched the
application, it opened instantly, displaying a user interface that was almost
bare compared to other PDF tools. However, the simple interface hid many
useful features under the hood.

When we added PDF files, the program displayed their page counts, paths and
sizes on the left, middle and right respectively. Once we had added the files
we wanted, we just needed to select the actions we wanted to perform.

We split PDF files into several one-page files, including files made up of
scanned images. We also divided some files into several parts by choosing
either the number of parts or maximum sizes we wanted. The ability to divide
PDF files into specified sizes can come in handy if you cannot send a file
because of size limitations.

Merging different files was also easy. We just added the files we wanted to
merge, sorted them in the order we wanted and then clicked the merge button.

The PDF file management tool also comes in handy in protecting your privacy.
Metadata can contain sensitive details that you would not like other people to
see. You can use the program to view available details, including title,
creator, author, producer, creation date and modification date. You can remove
these details with one click of the mouse. UnityPDF does not change the
original file, but instead it creates another file and adds Ano metadataA to
its name.

Whether you want to split, merge, insert PDF files or extract desired pages,
UnityPDF works like a breeze. You will complete even large tasks in a matter
of seconds. Please note that this is a PDF file management tool, not a PDF
reader.

Although the program does not come with a help file, and clicking help
redirects to a Web page that is still under development, using it is
straightforward.

The free PDF tool requires Windows XP or higher and [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-
Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html) or higher.
