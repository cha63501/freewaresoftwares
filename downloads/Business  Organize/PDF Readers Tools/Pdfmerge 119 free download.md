**Publisher's Description**  
  

PdfMerge was written to fill the need for producing large PDF documents from
multiple sources in an automated way. To serve this need it meets the
following requirements:

  * Allows the split and merge process to be driven from a list file
  * Allows the creation of bookmark trees by specifying bookmarks to be added (bookmarks are also called outlines)
  * Allows the import of bookmarks from the merged documents.
  * Supports merging of large documents quickly
  * Allows population of document title fields
PdfMerge is open source and completely free for both commercial and non-
commercial applications.  
  
PdfMerge uses the PDFsharp library for manipulation of the PDF file. For
PdfSharp licensing and information refer to the sourceforge page:
[sourceforge.net/projects/PDFsharp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/PDFsharp)

**What's New in version 1.19:**

  * Updated to PdfSharp 1.20, for better compatibility with latest PDF file versions 
  * Improved GUI to show bookmark levels more clearly 
  * When a PDF is added, the new addition uses the same bookmark level as previous 
  * Included a missing resource DLL in the installer 
  * Changed button label to "Merge/Split" to better reflect program function
