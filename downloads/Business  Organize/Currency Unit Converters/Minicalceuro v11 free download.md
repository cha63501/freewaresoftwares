**Publisher's Description**  
  

MiniCalcEuro is a small program in Visual C + that allows you to perform
conversions between Euro and all 12 currencies of the Euro zone (to and from).
It looks like a modal-dialog which means that it stays in the foreground if
one clicks on another window. When an amount is entered, the amount in the
other currency is automatically displayed.

This program is offered free to you and in unlimited version. All calculations
are made according to the official rules (number of significant digits,
rounding etc.)
