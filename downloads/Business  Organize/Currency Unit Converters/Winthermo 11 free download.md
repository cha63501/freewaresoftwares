**Publisher's Description**  
  

WinThermO is a graphical, interactive, temperature conversion and display
utility.

The User Interface is in the form of an attractive clipboard-mounted
thermometer. When you perform a temperature conversion - from Fahrenheit to
Celcius or vice versa, the scale of WinThermOA's thermometer automatically
adjusts to the range within which the values fall, and the mercury jumps to
the level of the result.

WinThermO features an extensive list of Useful Temperatures arranged in
categories such as Atmosphere, Human Body, Earth, Metal melting points,
Stove/oven levels etc. You simply select a category, click on a topic and
WinThermOA's thermometer scale adjusts to what needs to be shown, and the
mercury rises or falls to the result.

This is a great feature for both reference and educational purposes - the
graphical depiction of the various temperatures provides context, makes
comparisons easy and aids retention. Best of all, this feature is native to
the application - it does not require the installation of bulky database
components or capabilities.
