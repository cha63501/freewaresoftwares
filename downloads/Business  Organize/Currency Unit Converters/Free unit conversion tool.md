**Publisher's Description**  
  


Versaverter rapidly gained popularity world-wide as one of the fastest and most complete conversion tools around. The original version was written for Windows 2000 and did an admirable job but times have changed and we have began the process for propelling a new version of Versaverter into the modern era. 

The new version Versaverter 4 is a complete re-write of the application using the cross platform AdobeA(r) AIRA framework. We have retained all the key features that made Versaverter 3 such a success: Speed, extensive XML based library of units, automatic updates, and of course the free price tag!

The new version adds to this a much improved user interface, additional speed, and dynamic search.

**Requires:** [Adobe AIR](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Adobe-AIR_program_42448.html).

**Supported Operating Systems:** Windows XP/Vista/7, Mac OS X > 10.4, Linux.
