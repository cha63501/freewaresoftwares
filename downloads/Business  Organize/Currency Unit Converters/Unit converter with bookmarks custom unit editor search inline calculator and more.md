Converber requires approximately 207 kB of drive space, after installed (excluding 62 kB help file). This program is stand alone with no external .dll files or registry entries required (If using setup executable, one registry key is added to the Uninstall directory used for the Add or Remove Programs control panel applet). This makes a perfect program to keep on your USB drive!
