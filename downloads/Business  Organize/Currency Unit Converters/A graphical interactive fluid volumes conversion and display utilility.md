**Publisher's Description**  
  


AlcoVol is a graphical, interactive, fluid volumes conversion and display utility. The User Interface is in the form of an attractive A'panel-mountedA' flask - with scrolling units lists and controls adjacent to it. 

AlcoVolA's database includes all the major fluid volumes in use throughout the world today (including kitchen measures such as cups, tablespoons, teaspoons, dash etc), key historical and superseded units and the most extensive list of alcohol volume units available.

This makes AlcoVol of value not only to producers and distributors of beverages, but travelling consumers, liquor journalists, wine connoisserus, beer buffs and A'libation fansA' will also find it very handy. Other features include the ability to order units lists alphabetically, according to metric units first, UK and US units first, or Australian units first. You can also instantly swap A'fromA' and A'toA' units.

Predictive search on units lists - instead of A'scrolling and clickingA' on units, you can type out units in the textboxes above the lists and as you do so, AlcoVolA's lists automatically scroll to the A'best matchingA' units in the database - based on each letter you type.

Instantaneous conversions - as you click on a unit, type out a unit or type out a value, the conversion result immediately gets displayed numerically in a textbox and also graphically on AlcoVolA's A'flaskA' - the flaskA's scales and range automatically adjust to the values to be displayed. Graphical interactivity - you can physically drag the fluid level in the A'flaskA' up or down and the corresponding A'fromA' and A'toA' values scroll with the movement.

The color and appearance of the fluid in the A'flaskA' can be adjusted. Conversion reports - You can choose which conversions to save, and when youA're done, pressing A'Make FileA' results in a CSV textfile of your chosen conversions being produced (which you can easily import into say, a spreadsheet).
