System Requirements: The program has been tested on Windows (98, NT, 2K, XP).
Although it has not been verified, it will more than likely run on Windows 95
and ME, also. Converber requires approximately 207 kB of drive space, after
installed (excluding 62 kB help file). This program is stand alone with no
external .dll files or registry entries required (If using setup executable,
one registry key is added to the Uninstall directory used for the Add or
Remove Programs control panel applet). This makes a perfect program to keep on
your USB drive!
