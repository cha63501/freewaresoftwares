**Publisher's Description**  
  


Unit Converter is a freeware tool that can take care of all your unit conversions even when offline. It has an easy-to-use interface and contains most of the units commonly encountered while solving engineering problems. With more than 650 units, you are likely to find the units you are looking for. 

Other features include the ability to add user-defined conversions. Everything is built into a single executable file so no uninstaller is necessary. Its small file size makes it easy to distribute among friends and co-workers.

**What's New in version 5.4:**

  * Added ability to perform coordinate transformations from latitude/longitude to UTM (and vice-versa). 
  * Added Heat Flux conversion category with 25 units 
  * Added Magnetic Flux conversion category with 14 units 
  * Added Volumetric Heat Generation category with 11 units 
  * Added 6 new units to Fuel Consumption category (non-linear conversions such as Liters/100km to Miles/Gallon) 
  * Corrected conversion factor in Amount of Substance; 1 mol = 1000 mmol, showed 1000000 mmol 
  * Re-organized main menu. Also, added an icon next to each menu item. 
  * Quad-Lock Converter now uses Unicode for the entire program (UI controls and the engine), enabling internationalization. 
  * Removed restrictions such that users can now add an un-limited number of custom units and categories. Furthermore, users can also add non-multiplicative unit conversions (such as from Liters/100km to Miles/Gallon) 
  * Changed location of UnitConverter.ini (preferences file) to the %APPDATA%UnitConverter folder or, if running from a removable drive, to the removable drive's root folder (e.g. F:UnitConverter.ini). 
  * User defined custom categories can now be rendered visible or invisible in the main window using Main Menu > Edit > Preferences 
  * The conversion engine now uses a hash table to efficiently map unit names to associated conversion factors. This should improve speed on old and obsolete computers (the difference may not be noticeable on fast modern computers).
