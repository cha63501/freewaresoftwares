**Publisher's Description**  
  

E-Address Book is a free and useful software that allows you to keep names and
addresses of people. You can save almost all of a familyA's basic information
such as email addresses, phone numbers, websites, birthdays, anniversaries,
ages, or add image pointers for a photo to be shown. A scheduling page allows
you to save appointments.

You can import data from and export to a Microsoft Outlook vCard file, as well
as to a Palm OS handheld device. You can send email using EABA's address list
or your MS Outlook Address Book. You can print reports and set your photos in
EAB as a screensaver slideshow. Also has a notification program that can run
when Windows starts and will tell you either a day, week, or month in advance
when a birthday or anniversary is coming up. Still has some less important
features that need to be fixed such as printing envelopes, but it is fully
functional.
