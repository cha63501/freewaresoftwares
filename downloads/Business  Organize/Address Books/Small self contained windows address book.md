**Publisher's Description**  
  


A small application to store all your friendA's addresses in. 

Includes 2 name fields for all those Internet friends that you know rather by alias-name than by RealLife name :)

Since a lot of available applications out there are either too large to install just for a few addresses, or didnA't allow for the functions that I wanted (like having *two* name fields, one for the alias), this may be a good alternative.

Supports several different interface languages, printing, sorting, direct e-mailing from the program.
