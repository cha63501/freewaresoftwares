**Publisher's Description**  
  


E-Address Book is a free and useful software that allows you to keep names and addresses of people. You can save almost all of a familyA's basic information such as email addresses, phone numbers, websites, birthdays, anniversaries, ages, or add image pointers for a photo to be shown. A scheduling page allows you to save appointments. 

You can import data from and export to a Microsoft Outlook vCard file, as well as to a Palm OS handheld device. You can send email using EABA's address list or your MS Outlook Address Book. You can print reports and set your photos in EAB as a screensaver slideshow. Also has a notification program that can run when Windows starts and will tell you either a day, week, or month in advance when a birthday or anniversary is coming up. Still has some less important features that need to be fixed such as printing envelopes, but it is fully functional.
