**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Intelligent Messaging Software (IMS) plays telephone on hold messages using a Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT or Windows 98 computer with any standard sound card. The software runs in the background using the CPU idle time and the buffer on the sound card. The computer can still be used as normal. If you have a Windows computer in your office, this is an advanced and affordable way to play on hold messages to your callers when they are on hold or being transferred.
