**Publisher's Description**  
  


Competitive Intelligence Calculator (CIC) estimates competitive intelligence capability of your company/business on three dimensions: risk identification, risk monitoring, and management actions. CIC is based on the concept proposed by Dr. Ben Gilad in his book "Early Warning: Using Competitive Intelligence to Anticipate Market Shifts, Control Risk, and Create Powerful Strategies", Amacom 2004. 

Dr. Ben Gilad defines competitive intelligence in the following way: "Competitive intelligence is the gathering and analysis of information from human and published sources about market trends and industry developments that allow for advanced identification of risks and opportunities in the competitive arena...before they are obvious to everyone but your company!" (Quoted with permission from Dr. Ben Gilad).
