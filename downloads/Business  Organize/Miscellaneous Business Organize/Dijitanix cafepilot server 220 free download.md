**Publisher's Description**  
  

CafePilot is a cross-platform (Windows and Linux) client/server software suite
that makes managing an Internet cafe of any size a breeze.

CafePilot supports connections over the Internet so Internet cafe businesses
with multiple branches can use a centralized server. This will allow customers
to roam between branches with generated pre-paid tickets.

CafePilot Service Request Monitor (SRM) allows a Cafe manager to see, in real-
time, requests for attention by customers and the status of those requests. An
attendant can also monitor the SRM to see what refreshments/products customers
are ordering. Best of all, there is no limit to the number of SRMs that can
run on your network and SRM licensing is based on the number of
products/services being served and not on the number of SRMs running.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It

Linux version available at the [developerA's
website](http://www.dijitanix.com).
