**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you ever wondered something like these:  

  * When was the last time I had McDonaldA's?
  * How many days ago did I charge my mobile phone? I feel like it was not long ago, but why do I have to charge it again now?
  * When was the last time I went to the beach?
  * How many times a month do I buy my kidA's milk?
If you have, then you can use J-Tracker to track your activities. J-Tracker
records all the activities you want to track by date. It then shows the
records you have entered in a year-view calendar to make it very easy for you
to review.  
  
Features:

  * Track any of your activities.
  * Unlimited category with sub-categories.
  * Add a description for each of your activities you record.
  * When you add a record, the date will be shown in color of your choice, to make it very easy to be seen. You can select up to 20 colors. The default color is yellow.
  * Very easy to use.
  * Full of shortcuts to make you work faster using keyboard.
  * When you add a description, the date will be shown in **bold**.
  * To add a record, just select the date you want to add then click A'Add an OccurenceA'. The same goes to deleting a record and editing a recordA's description.
  * Click on the date you want to edit / delete on the calendar, then the Date Picker (the little calendar on the bottom of the screen) will be adjusted automatically, so you donA't have to select the date you want to edit / delete from the Date Picker. It saves time and energy!
Requirements:

  * Windows 98 SE and above.
  * Microsoft Data Access Component. You should already have this if youA're using Windows XP.
For programmers, J-Tracker is using:

  * Microsoft Access 2000 for the database back-end.
  * Microsoft Visual Basic 6 for the programming language.
You can also modify J-Tracker as much as you like by downloading the source
code.
