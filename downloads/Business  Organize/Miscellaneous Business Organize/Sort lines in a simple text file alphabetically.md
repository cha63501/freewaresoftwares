**Publisher's Description**  
  


AlphaSort was created so I wouldnA't have to keep opening a big bloated word processing application, just to sort lines in a simple text file, alphabetically. 

It can also be used to build your lists. Sorting of an already existing text file is simple: open the file in AlphaSort and hit the Save button.

Creating a sorted list is almost as simple: Hit your enter key, type your line, hit enter again, repeat for additional lines, save the file with either a .txt, .slf (Sorted List File), or whatever extension you need.
