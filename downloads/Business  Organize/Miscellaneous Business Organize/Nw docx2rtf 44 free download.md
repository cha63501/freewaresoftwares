**Publisher's Description**  
  

Docx2Rtf is a freeware file converter for MS Word 2007 Docx and OpenOffice Sxw
and Odt files. You do not need OpenOffice or Office 2007 to be installed for
the program to work. Word 2007 Docx files (*.docx; *.dotx) and OpenOffice
files (*.sxw,*.odt) will be converted to richtext (rtf) format with partial
formatting and images.

Docx2Rtf isnA't perfect in what it can retrieve from these files, but it does
a decent job of retrieving your basic information. While you are converting
these documents, Docx2Rtf will show you a page by page layout of what was
retrieved and let you send it to your printer. Docx2Rtf can also convert those
Word 2007 and OpenOffice documents to PDF format!

Docx2Rtf also allows you to view most common graphic file formats. Since
version 3.4 Docx2Rtf even allows you to extract text (if available) from pdf
files!

Docx2Rtf also has support for documents (ebooks) stored in the PalmOS Database
(pdb) format and Aportis documents (prc) format. Load, read and print most
files in pdb and prc formats.

In addition to importing docx, dotx, odt and sxw, pdb and prc files, Docx2Rtf
can also open, view and print - plain text (*.txt), Portable Document Format
(*.pdf), Hypertext Markup Language (*.html) and Richtext (*.rtf) files!

**WhatA's New in version 4.4:**
