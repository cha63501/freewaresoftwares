**Publisher's Description**  
  

This software was developed to determine the acceleration time of a
translation system according to the third edition of 1987 FEM rules. The
neccessities to use this software reside in considering that the function to
determine the acceleration time is "step like" therefore, the interpolation is
difficult.
