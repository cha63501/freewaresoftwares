**Publisher's Description**  
  

**BitNami SugarCRM Stack** Native Installer is an easy-to-install distribution of the SugarCRM application. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run versions of Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin so users can get a SugarCRM installation up and running in minutes after answering a few questions. Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Unix operating systems are supported. 

SugarCRM is a flexible customer relationship management solution for companies
of all sizes. SugarCRM can easily be customized and integrated with other
software to allow companies to build and maintain a more flexible system. Core
functionality includes sales force automation, marketing campaigns, support
cases, project management and calendaring.

Here are some key features of the BitNami Stacks Native Installers:

**Easy to Install:**  

BitNami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as possible
to install open source software. Our installers completely automate the
process of installing and configuring all of the software included in each
Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

**Independent:**  

BitNami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere
with any software already installed on your system.

**Integrated:**  

By the time you click the A'finishA' button on the installer, the whole stack
will be integrated, configured and ready to go.

**Relocatable:**  

BitNami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have
multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each
other.
