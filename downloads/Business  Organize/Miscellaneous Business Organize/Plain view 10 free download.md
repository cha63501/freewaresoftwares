**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you have lots of plain text files on your hard drive then you will know how
frustrating it can be sometimes to open them all individually to find the info
you are looking for. This handy utility will help you to quickly browse
through your drives and folders and display the text files with just a few
clicks. Simple but effective.

This application was previously released as "Speed Reader" but this latest
version goes back to the original idea of text-only use so the image features
have now been removed and developed into a seperate utility.

**Features:**

  * Drop-down folder browser 
  * Select file to load from list 
  * Display text in viewer 
  * Show or hide browser pane 
  * Read-only for safe viewing 
  * Quick and easy to use
