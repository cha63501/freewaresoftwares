**Publisher's Description**  
  

KMB Text Compare implements a diff algorithm. The original idea for this
program was to compare G-Code programs to check if there were any differences
between versions and/or machines. This program is not limited to G-Code
programs, but can compare any type of file containing text or values.

There are many useful functions for the user. Each matching line is set side
by side. If a different line is detected, it is offset and indicated when the
cell is filled in. The user is capable of customizing the different cell
fill/font color. The user can also choose if KMB Text Compare recognizes
upper/lower case letters, spaces. The user can also choose if KMB Text Compare
opens the files as text or values.

Another useful function is that the user can open the selected file for
editing. The default editor is Notepad.exe, but the user can add other editing
programs if they wish. The last file names are saved and will appear in the
edit boxes the next time the user loads files. This is a very powerful tool,
yet easy for anyone use.

Please note that the algorithm is a little slow. The user should only load
files that they know are similar. The larger the file and the amount of
different lines will determine how long KMB Text Compare takes to load the
files. A help file is included to assist the user. Note: KMB Text Compare is
included with KMB Trace 2007.
