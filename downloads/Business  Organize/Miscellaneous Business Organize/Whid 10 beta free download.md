**Publisher's Description**  
  

Whid is a simple application that keeps track of time. You can use it to see
what you actually did today, or you can use it to keep track of time spent on
projects. It can also print invoices.

The idea behind WTM and WHID is very simple: When I start to work on a project
I click on the project and the AStartA button. Then the meter is running until
I press the ADoneA button. If I am interrupted by a new customer, I click on
his project and press the AStartA button again. The previous meter for the
project is put on hold, and the meter is running for the new one. When I press
the ADoneA button, the previous project becomes the current project, and the
meter is running again. If I take a break, I press the APauseA button and the
meter is put on hold.

WHID is also a program designed for people who work with projects in an
office. People like me. IA'm lazy, and therefore IA've made WHID as easy to
use and foolproof as I can. I like to work with my source code. I donA't like
to to write lists of hours or bills or accounting at all.
