**Publisher's Description**  
  

kCalculator is a simple calculator, text editor and calendar that has been
designed to be intuitive to use.

The text editor is intended to act more as a scratch pad rather than a fully
functioned editor. As a calculator, kCalculatorAs distinguishing functionality
is the ability to restructure the AConvertA menu with your own preferences of
conversion factors or multipliers.

By editing the Multipliers.txt file, you can create an unlimited set of
conversion factors or multipliers which can be added to your AconvertA menu;
quite simply, you can customise the set of conversion factors to suit your own
needs.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
