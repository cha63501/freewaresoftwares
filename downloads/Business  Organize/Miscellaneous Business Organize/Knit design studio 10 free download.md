**Publisher's Description**  
  

A handy tool for designers who need to make graphs with both common and not-
so-common knitting operations. Great for graphing lace patterns, and also
cables.

When the graph is complete, a key is automatically made of any knitting
operations included in the graph. There is also space to type in any needed
knitting instructions (such as shaping).

Files can be printed, or saved as a picture file (graph only) to be used in
another application. Help files are included to aid in use of the program.
