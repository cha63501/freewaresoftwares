Here are some key features of the BitNami Stacks Native Installers:

**Easy to Install:**

BitNami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as possible to install open source software. Our installers completely automate the process of installing and configuring all of the software included in each Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

**Independent:**

BitNami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere with any software already installed on your system.

**Integrated:**

By the time you click the A'finishA' button on the installer, the whole stack will be integrated, configured and ready to go.

**Relocatable:**

BitNami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each other.
