**Publisher's Description**  
  


Have you ever lost critical files on your computer and then had to repeat all your hard work? 

Maybe you update an issue log or report on your hours worked every week. Maybe you update a spreadsheet on a regular basis. Maybe you are writing code or project management documents. Whatever type of file or document you are working with, Version It! can help enable you to go back to previous versions. If you inadvertently made changes, saved it, and then realized later that you wanted or needed to go back to a previous version, Version It! will help you.

Or if someone you work with or maybe your spouse or child accidentally modified or deleted your file, with Version It! you can go back to the last version you created.

It is so simple to run Version It! Simply right click on the file that you want to save a version of. Version It! will save a copy to a subfolder called #VERSIONS. It will create this subfolder if it does not already exist. Then your file will be copied to the #VERSIONS folder with a unique date and time stamp right before the file extension. 

By leaving your file in its native format and not changing the extension, youAll be able to double click it to open it with the program you normally use for the file extension. You wonAt need any other tools to open the file and see the changes. You can either view it, copy what you need, or copy the whole file back by simply copying it and renaming it to the original name.

Since the multiple versions are stored in their own folder, you can easily back up this folder if you need it later or delete it when your file is complete and you are done updating your file. Or you can keep it as long as you like.

The program is freeware for both home and commercial use. You are not allowed to sell it or charge for its distribution, but please pass it on for free to anyone.

This program has been a real lifesaver for me and I know youAll love it too.
