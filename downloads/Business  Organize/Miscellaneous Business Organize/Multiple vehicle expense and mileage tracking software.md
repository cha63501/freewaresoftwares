**Publisher's Description**  
  


CarLog is a standalone software for maintaining multiple vehicle expense and mileage records. This software can be used to maintain vehicle records either for personal or taxation purposes. 

It is standalone. This means it is not dependent on any other application (like database or spreadsheets etc.) on your computer. You do not need any other application to run CarLog.

It has a fully featured print and print-previewing capability integrated with the Windows system. You can print data from CarLog and keep hardcopies for backup or submission for tax purposes. You can also setup printer and page (for printing) from CarLog.

One of the important goals of CarLog is maintaining records for tax purposes. CarLog allows auto-calculation of GST (Goods and Services Tax). You can also specify "Personal Usage %" for any expense or miles/kms travelled. These features are very useful for claiming tax deductions at the end of the financial year.

You can easily backup CarLog data for disaster recovery (built in feature).

CarLog has an intuitive and intelligent data-entry sheet. You need not use the mouse to select individual cells in the data-sheet. Keyboard up-down-left-right keys are sufficient to navigate. This feature takes some pain out of entering data.

CarLog comes with a complete usage guide and help.

CarLog does not have a "Save" or "Save As" button. Data from CarLog is automatically saved on termination of CarLog.

CarLog can export its data to CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. This will allow you to view the CarLog data in a spreadsheet application (like Microsoft Excel) or import the data into a database (that your existing accounting package is using).
