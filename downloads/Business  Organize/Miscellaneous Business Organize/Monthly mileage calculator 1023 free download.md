**Publisher's Description**  
  

The MMC (Monthly Mileage Calculator) stores Locations, Dates, Times Visited
and Cents per mile for totaling at the end of the month.

The program allows IT professionals or anyone who drives for their job, to
keep track of how much mileage theyA've accumulated over a month. The cents-
per-mile allows you to get an active estimation of how much youA'll be getting
at the end of the month. This information is displayed in a nicely formatted
notepad document.

The programs growth depends on its users. In order to improve it, I need
feedback. Please, comment on the site about any kind of new features or
changes that should be added or changed.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
