**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you ever lost critical files on your computer and then had to repeat all
your hard work?

Maybe you update an issue log or report on your hours worked every week. Maybe
you update a spreadsheet on a regular basis. Maybe you are writing code or
project management documents. Whatever type of file or document you are
working with, Version It! can help enable you to go back to previous versions.
If you inadvertently made changes, saved it, and then realized later that you
wanted or needed to go back to a previous version, Version It! will help you.

Or if someone you work with or maybe your spouse or child accidentally
modified or deleted your file, with Version It! you can go back to the last
version you created.

It is so simple to run Version It! Simply right click on the file that you
want to save a version of. Version It! will save a copy to a subfolder called
#VERSIONS. It will create this subfolder if it does not already exist. Then
your file will be copied to the #VERSIONS folder with a unique date and time
stamp right before the file extension.

By leaving your file in its native format and not changing the extension,
youAll be able to double click it to open it with the program you normally use
for the file extension. You wonAt need any other tools to open the file and
see the changes. You can either view it, copy what you need, or copy the whole
file back by simply copying it and renaming it to the original name.

Since the multiple versions are stored in their own folder, you can easily
back up this folder if you need it later or delete it when your file is
complete and you are done updating your file. Or you can keep it as long as
you like.

The program is freeware for both home and commercial use. You are not allowed
to sell it or charge for its distribution, but please pass it on for free to
anyone.

This program has been a real lifesaver for me and I know youAll love it too.
