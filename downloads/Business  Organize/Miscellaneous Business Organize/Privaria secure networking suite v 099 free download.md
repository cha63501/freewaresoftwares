When you and one or more trusted colleagues have PRIVARIA installed on your
computers, a couple of mouse clicks is all you need to request remote access
to each othersA' computer desktops, exchange files, open a shared whiteboard
for collaborative text editing and drawing, or start a videoconference, all
with strong encryption. ThereA's no need to fuss around with IP addresses or
arcane encryption tools, sign up with some third-party connection management
service, or beg your network administrator to allow incoming connections
through your firewall.
