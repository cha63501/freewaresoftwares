**Publisher's Description**  
  

CarLog is a standalone software for maintaining multiple vehicle expense and
mileage records. This software can be used to maintain vehicle records either
for personal or taxation purposes.

It is standalone. This means it is not dependent on any other application
(like database or spreadsheets etc.) on your computer. You do not need any
other application to run CarLog.

It has a fully featured print and print-previewing capability integrated with
the Windows system. You can print data from CarLog and keep hardcopies for
backup or submission for tax purposes. You can also setup printer and page
(for printing) from CarLog.

One of the important goals of CarLog is maintaining records for tax purposes.
CarLog allows auto-calculation of GST (Goods and Services Tax). You can also
specify "Personal Usage %" for any expense or miles/kms travelled. These
features are very useful for claiming tax deductions at the end of the
financial year.

You can easily backup CarLog data for disaster recovery (built in feature).

CarLog has an intuitive and intelligent data-entry sheet. You need not use the
mouse to select individual cells in the data-sheet. Keyboard up-down-left-
right keys are sufficient to navigate. This feature takes some pain out of
entering data.

CarLog comes with a complete usage guide and help.

CarLog does not have a "Save" or "Save As" button. Data from CarLog is
automatically saved on termination of CarLog.

CarLog can export its data to CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. This will
allow you to view the CarLog data in a spreadsheet application (like Microsoft
Excel) or import the data into a database (that your existing accounting
package is using).
