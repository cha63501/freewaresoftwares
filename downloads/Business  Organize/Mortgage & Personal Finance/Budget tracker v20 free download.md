Budget Tracker is an easy to use program that will help you track and
understand your monthly expenses. Each month you can enter in a number of
specific monthly expenses including Rent/Mortgage, Utilities, Grocery,
Entertainment, Phone, Medical, Clothing, and more. Each of these is tracked
per month, but also a running average is kept for each expense over time. So
you can see just how much you spend on average for specific items.

Budget Tracker is designed to be easy to enter all your expense data. All the
averages and monthly totals are on the main screen so you can get a quick view
of your personal finances. Other data that is tracked includes an overall
monthly average expenditure as well as the highest month and the lowest month.
In the end, Budget Tracker?s goal is to help you get a grip on where your
money is going allowing you to better manage your finances.
