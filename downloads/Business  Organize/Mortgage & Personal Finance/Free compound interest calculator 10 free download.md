**Publisher's Description**  
  

This Compound Interest Calculator will show you graphically how much extra
money you will make by reinvesting your gains and maintaining your principal
payments.

If you look at the default values, you will see how the interest and capital
begin to grow fairly quickly after an initial stage of reinvestment. Try some
values of your own and see how you can grow your investments with compound
interest.

The Compound Interest Calculator has no spyware and does not connect to the
internet at all.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
