**Publisher's Description**  
  


Financial Fate projects all sources and uses of family cash flows for the do-it-yourselfer. Detailed reports such as investment plans, balance sheets, tax plans, and cash flow projections are made available to the user with year-by-year and line-item-detail visibility. 

For example, when forecasting health-care expenses, Financial Fate will automatically adjust these health-care expenses for retirement, Medicare, tax implications, changing family sizes, etc. These automatic adjustments have a significant impact on future cash flows and are fully-disclosed in the Financial Fate reports. Plus all the underlying assumptions are disclosed and can be changed by the user, if desired. 

Without this level of detail and visibility, a financial plan should not be considered realistic because it cannot be verified. Quality planning must start with full disclosure of detailed reports and avoid a "black box" approach. In other words, trust but verify!
