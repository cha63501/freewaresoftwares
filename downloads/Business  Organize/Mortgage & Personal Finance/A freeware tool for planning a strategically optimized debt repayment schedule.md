**Publisher's Description**  
  


Credit-Repair-Planner helps create an optimized repayment schedule which factors in credit improvement. The concept is simple: pay off the highest-interest cards first while bearing in mind that carrying in excess of 50% on any revolving credit line dings your credit score. 

Credit-Repair-Planner will break this down into two repayment schedules - the first to get all cards down below 50% and the second to take them down the rest of the way. Although Credit-Repair-Planner is useful for scheduling repayment, it is meant primarily as an educational tool -- making the path to credit-repayment explicit, concrete and visual. A clear understanding of the debt-repayment path is a crucial part of lifelong debt management. 

To use Credit-Repair-Planner, just download and run - the program is entirely self-contained and requires no installation (it can also be run directly from fixed media such as floppy or CD). Credit-Repair-Planner is a single, clean, compact executable with no spyware or DLL dependencies. It is part of an expanding collection of freeware tools available from atilla-credit-repair.info.
