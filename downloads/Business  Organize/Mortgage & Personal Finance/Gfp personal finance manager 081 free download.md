**Publisher's Description**  
  

GFP is a Personal Finance Manager that uses a different approach to help
people organize their finances, itAs focus is the real account (bank account,
account saving and others), while other software focuses on accounting
accounts. So while in a typical finance manager you create accounts related
with some aspects you want to control (expenses, gas expenses, food expenses,
income, payment, and even real accounts like bank accounts) and make
transactions with these accounts, in GFP these accounts are considered as
categories, under the user perspective, and user can create real accounts and
make transactions with them, providing a type for each transaction.

In GFP: Real accounts: bank account, account saving and others Type of
transactions: expenses, gas expenses, food expenses, income, payment. GFP user
can get reports (not yet implemented) showing where, when, why and how (s)heAs
making expenses. GFP is currently translated to Portuguese, English, French,
Italian, German and Spanish.
