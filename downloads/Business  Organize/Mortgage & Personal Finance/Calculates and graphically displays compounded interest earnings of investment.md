This Compound Interest Calculator will show you graphically how much extra money you will make by reinvesting your gains and maintaining your principal payments. 

If you look at the default values, you will see how the interest and capital begin to grow fairly quickly after an initial stage of reinvestment. Try some values of your own and see how you can grow your investments with compound interest.

The Compound Interest Calculator has no spyware and does not connect to the internet at all.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
