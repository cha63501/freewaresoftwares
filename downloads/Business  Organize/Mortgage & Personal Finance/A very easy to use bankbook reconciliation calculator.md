RecBook is a very easy to use Bankbook Reconciliation Calculator designed for those with even the least amount of computer experience. Simply input your statement balance, add outstanding checks and deposits not shown on the current statement, enter your checkbook balance and the program will tell you if you are in balance or not, and if not, by how much you are off. 

RecBook is NOT a checkbook register and as such will not record your data for permanent storage. When you shut down the software, all data is gone without a trace, protecting your personal information. Free from Adware, Spyware and Malware as with all PromoSoft products, your privacy is of utmost importance.
