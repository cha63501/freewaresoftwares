**Publisher's Description**  
  

Credit-Repair-Planner helps create an optimized repayment schedule which
factors in credit improvement. The concept is simple: pay off the highest-
interest cards first while bearing in mind that carrying in excess of 50% on
any revolving credit line dings your credit score.

Credit-Repair-Planner will break this down into two repayment schedules - the
first to get all cards down below 50% and the second to take them down the
rest of the way. Although Credit-Repair-Planner is useful for scheduling
repayment, it is meant primarily as an educational tool -- making the path to
credit-repayment explicit, concrete and visual. A clear understanding of the
debt-repayment path is a crucial part of lifelong debt management.

To use Credit-Repair-Planner, just download and run - the program is entirely
self-contained and requires no installation (it can also be run directly from
fixed media such as floppy or CD). Credit-Repair-Planner is a single, clean,
compact executable with no spyware or DLL dependencies. It is part of an
expanding collection of freeware tools available from atilla-credit-
repair.info.
