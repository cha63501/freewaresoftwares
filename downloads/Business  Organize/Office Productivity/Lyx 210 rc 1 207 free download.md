**Publisher's Description**  
  

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based on
the structure of your documents (WYSIWYM) and not simply their appearance
(WYSIWYG).

LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease of use of a
graphical interface. This results in world-class support for creation of
mathematical content (via a fully integrated equation editor) and structured
documents like academic articles, theses, and books. In addition, staples of
scientific authoring such as reference list and index creation come standard.
But you can also use LyX to create a letter or a novel or a theatre play or
film script. A broad array of ready, well-designed document layouts are built
in.

LyX is for people who want their writing to look great, right out of the box.
No more endless tinkering with formatting details, Afinger paintingA font
attributes or futzing around with page boundaries. You just write. On screen,
LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output A or richly cross-
referenced PDF, just as readily produced A looks like nothing else.
