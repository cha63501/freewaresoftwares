**Publisher's Description**  
  

DanielA's XL Toolbox is a free add-in for MicrosoftA(r) ExcelA(r) for
researchers in the biomedical and other sciences. Its worksheet management
features also make it a useful general-purpose addin. ANOVA, smart custom
error bars, spread scatter and much more.

There are several commercial software packages for scientific data analysis
and presentation. While their statistical and scientific charting functions
are unmatched, they are themselves no match for ExcelA's flexibility when it
comes to organizing your data. Often, researchers end up having their data in
several files: Most is stored in ExcelA(r), and for specific analysis and
presentation tasks, some of it is copied over to one of the dedicated
scientific packages. If you prefer to store, comment and analyze your data in
one place, you should try DanielA's XL Toolbox.

  * MicrosoftA(r) Windows 2000, XP (Vista not tested).
