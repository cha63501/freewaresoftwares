**Publisher's Description**  
  


Portable OpenOffice.org will allow you to carry an entire office suite - word processing, presentations, spreadsheet, drawing, etc. - with you on an iPod, portable hard drive, USB thumbdrive or any other portable media. You can plug it right into any Windows computer and use it just like you would on your own. 

Portable OpenOffice.org is a repackaged version of OpenOffice.org designed with portability in mind. It works just like regular OpenOffice.org installed on your computer does, except it allows you to use it on any Windows computer without installing anything. It has all the features of the excellent OpenOffice.org office suite except for the Data application. It also includes some special enhancements to make it work even better from your portable drive.
