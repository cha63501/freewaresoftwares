Retirement Scheduler is a small utility software with big features. It firstly asks from user to select the age of retirement (from 55 to 65 years) applicable in his organization and after that only a small information of any employee like name, designation, department, date of birth and date of joining is required. Once the data is entered, all the reports for the selected retirement age can be generated. 

Four types of reports viz. Individual Reports, Department Reports, Timed Reports and Complete Report can be generated. In Individual Reports the list of persons are available in drop-down menu and if you donAt find the name in the list, you can type few letters of the name to find the particular record. Similarly for departmental reports, the list of persons of any particular department is available by selecting the department through a drop-down menu and also by typing the few letters of department name.

Similarly a complete report can be generated of all the departments sorted as per the date of retirements of employees working in them. This software was planned to get the precise information of retiring employees so that the effective HR planning could be made for the new recruitments.
