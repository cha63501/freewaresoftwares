**Publisher's Description**  
  

Go-OO is a fork of OpenOffice that has quite a few impressive features which
really ought to be in official OO, but for some reason or another arenA't,
such as support for OpenXML, better Microsoft Binary support, Excel VBA
macros, Visio diagrams and Word Perfect Graphics support. It also boasts
significantly better start times -- at least on our poorly equipped test
machine.

**Better interoperability**  
Go-oo has built in OpenXML import filters and it will import your Microsoft
Works files. Compared with up-stream OO.o, it has better Microsoft binary file
support (with eg. fields support), and it will import WordPerfect graphics
beautifully. If you are reliant on Excel VBA macros - then Go-oo offers the
best macro fidelity too. If you expect your spreadsheets to calculate
compatibly, or you get embedded Visio diagrams in your documents, youA'll want
Go-oo.

**Better functionality**  
Go-ooA's user interface is more familiar, with lots of small pieces of polish.
We have built-in (working) multimedia integration on Linux, a beautiful solver
component, and your Chinese should look sane. We also integrate with your
system better by default: eg. enabling native file-selectors on Linux.

**A Faster application**  
From first-time startup, where we sort I/O to reduce seek cost, to a highly
optimised second start application and a systray quick-starter on Linux we are
faster. We use less memory than up-stream, we link faster, use better system
allocators, and donA't waste so much time & memory in the registry. Go-oo
performance is hard to beat.

**Faster code integration**  
Contributing code to go-oo is simple, and fast, following the traditional
hackersA' process of peer code review: just mail patches to the mailing list,
or when we get used to your code - commit your patch immediately to HEAD ooo-
build: no CWS, no hours of tagging, paperwork, no specification, no hassle. Of
course - if your patch sucks - expect to hear how it can be improved.

Go-OO offers all the features of the official OpenOffice plus additional
features such as:

  * OpenXML / DOCX support 
  * OpenXML / XLSX support 
  * OpenXML / PPTX support 
  * SVG support 
  * 3D transitions 
  * Rich fields support 
  * Calc solver 
  * Improved Excel interoperability 
  * VBA support 
  * GStreamer integration 
  * Mono integration 
  * Text Grid rendering 
  * MS-Works import 
  * Improved EMF rendering 
  * WordPerfect Graphics import 
  * T602 import 
  * much more...
