A Digital Web Book is a stand-alone executable file that will run on any
Windows platform. It requires no plug-ins or additional software.

Nor does it make any changes to your system, but is simply saved, the same way
that an image or document file is saved. Kwik Facts may be downloaded directly
as an EXE or ZIP file.
