**Publisher's Description**  
  

The base of the EUPSCO application is the service catalogue. All services link
to microsoft runbooks. By requesting a service from the catalogue, the user
automatically starts a runbook in Microsoft System Center.

EUPSCO is a web based application that needs IIS to run. For storing the
necessary information a MS SQL (express) database is also required. As a
standard, EUPSCO is configured to use Active Directory as a data source. But
in the future it can use runbooks for data collection.

The ITQ End User Portal communicates with SCO through the standard build-in
web REST API. You just need to create the appropriate user permissions in SCO
for EUPSCO and it is connected.
