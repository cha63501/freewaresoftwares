OxygenOffice Professional (was: OpenOffice.org Premium) is an enhanced version of OpenOffice.org which is a multi-platform office productivity suite. It includes the key desktop applications, such as a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation manager, and drawing program, with a user interface and feature set similar to other office suites. OxygenOffice Professional contains more extras like templates, cliparts, samples, fonts and VBA support. 

Few of the extras you get with OxygenOffice Professional:

  * Multiple monitor support for Impress 
  * Improved Calc HTML export 
  * Enhanced Access support for Base 
  * Fixed security issues

More than 3,200 graphics are included, both clip art and photos. These pictures are integrated into the gallery and can easily be placed into any OxygenOffice document. Several templates and sample documents are included, as well as over 90 fonts.

The extras are integrated by default in the installation of OxygenOffice Professional, but they are optional, so the user can decide what parts to include and what parts to leave out. These extra templates, fonts, and graphics are free for both personal and professional use.

Additional tools like OOoWikipedia, which can search the free on-line encyclopaedia Wikipedia, are also included. An enhanced help menu, addtional UserA's Manual, and the enabled extended tips are great to help beginners get started using OxygenOffice Professional.

OxygenOffice Professional is based on OpenOffice.org 2.1. This latest and greatest version has new functions like enhanced PDF management and direct export to LaTex.

The OxygenOffice Professional team of internatioanl developers changed the name of the project , (which was formerly known as OpenOffice.org Premium), to simplify things and point out that this project is independent from the OpenOffice.org project. Our team loves and supports the OpenOffice.org project, and did not want to cause any potential confusion.
