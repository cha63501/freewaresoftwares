Finds and selects entire rows or subsections of rows in an Excel worksheet
that contain spaces and zeros (the default) or any specified string. The user
then has the option to look over the selection and deselect any that should
not be deleted and then choose to delete all of the remaining selected rows.
It is useful if you pull data in from other sources and wish to clean-up empty
or useless rows.

This is a stand-alone application, not an Excel Add-In. To use: Run Excel
Utility. Use it to open an Excel file. When done, you can close Excel Utility
and continue to work with the Excel file, or have Excel Utility close the
file.
