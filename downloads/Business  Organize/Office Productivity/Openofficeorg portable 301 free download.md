**Publisher's Description**  
  

Portable OpenOffice.org will allow you to carry an entire office suite - word
processing, presentations, spreadsheet, drawing, etc. - with you on an iPod,
portable hard drive, USB thumbdrive or any other portable media. You can plug
it right into any Windows computer and use it just like you would on your own.

Portable OpenOffice.org is a repackaged version of OpenOffice.org designed
with portability in mind. It works just like regular OpenOffice.org installed
on your computer does, except it allows you to use it on any Windows computer
without installing anything. It has all the features of the excellent
OpenOffice.org office suite except for the Data application. It also includes
some special enhancements to make it work even better from your portable
drive.
