**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Visio 2007 Viewer allows anyone to view Visio drawings and diagrams (created with Visio 5.0, 2000, 2002, 2003, or 2007) inside their Internet Explorer version 5.0 or later Web browser. 

Visio users can freely distribute Visio drawings and diagrams to team members, partners, customers, or others, even if the recipients do not have Visio installed on their computers. Internet Explorer also allows for printing, although this is limited to the portion of the drawing displayed.

The Visio 2007 Viewer enables users to discover the advantages of using Visio drawings, charts, and illustrations in a Web-based environment. The Visio 2007 Viewer is particularly useful for teams that need to collaborate from different locations.

Viewing Visio drawings is as simple as double-clicking the drawing (files with the .VSD, .VSS, .VST, .VDX, .VSX, or .VTX extension) in Windows File Explorer. Internet Explorer will open, and the Visio 2007 Viewer will render the drawing in the browser window. You can then pan and zoom in the drawing window by using toolbar buttons, keyboard shortcuts, or menu items in the right-click menu. Also, you can see properties on any shape by opening the Properties and Settings dialog box and then selecting a shape. Some rendering and display settings are available in the Display Settings tab of the Properties and Settings dialog box. Additionally, drawing-layer visibility and colors can be set in the Layer Settings tab, and annotation visibility and colors can be set in the Markup Settings tab.

**Notes:**

  * Both Visio Binary (.VSD) and XML (.VDX) files are supported. 
  * The Visio 2007 Viewer is implemented as an ActiveX control that loads and renders Visio drawings inside Internet Explorer. 
  * Windows XP or later operating system is required for Ink support. Objects created with the Ink tool in Visio will not display on Windows 2000.
