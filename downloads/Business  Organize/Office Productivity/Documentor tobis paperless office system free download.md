DOCUMENTOR is a FREE, multi-user, paperless office system for a profession, or
small business. It mimics a typical file cabinet, with sectioned file folders,
to organize, search, and retrieve files of any type. Input with a scanner or
camera, or created with a program like Word or Excel, any file can be
incorporated. Files can also be created and edited from user defined
templates. Some file types can be directly viewed, printed, and faxed, while
other file types are loaded and manipulated in their, extension identified,
source programs. This program ALSO is available with a FREE, integrated,
problem oriented database and word processing report writer, optimized for
data entry using voice recognition, and designed for medical care.
