**Publisher's Description**  
  

Barcodeworks is a freeware plugin for Microsoft Word (97 and above). It can be
used to insert UPC, EAN-8, EAN-13, JAN codes and ITF (interleaved 2 of 5)
coded barcodes into your Word document.

The plugin does not need any special fonts to create a barcode, it inserts the
barcode as a word-picture composed from lines and (optional) digits. Word
documents prepared this way can therefore be sent to other users without them
having to install or buy a special font.

Version 3.2 supports One-Click conversion of EAN-codes. More information can
be found at the website.
