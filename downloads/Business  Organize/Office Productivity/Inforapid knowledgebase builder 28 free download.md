**Publisher's Description**  
  

InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder is one of the most useful programs for mind
mapping and network thinking, i.e. for understanding relationships, finding
patterns and deriving or making sustainable decisions. The program is free for
private use, so that as many people as possible can use the program and
benefit from it.

You will ask: What is the difference between InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder
and all the other programs used to create Mind Maps? Why should I prefer it?
With the other programs, the size of the diagram is limited, they quickly get
confusing if they get larger. Not so with InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder. It
can manage millions of items.

While pure Mind Map programs are often limited to hierarchical trees,
InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder can connect any item with any other. It also
contains an archive, into which documents and images can be imported and from
which they can be attached to any item or relation.
