**Publisher's Description**  
  

TimeClue is a free, simple and tiny time reminder software that fades your
desktop into a bluish color at fixed intervals.

TimeClue is designed to help you develop a habit of resting your eyes every 15
minutes (recommended for heavy computer users). Alerts are raised at fixed
time, as otherwise that habit will never stick.

At minute 0, 15, 30 and 45 of each hour, the fader gets activated. If the
program hasnA't been running for at least 15 minutes, it wonA't become active.
When activated, TimeClue fades the desktop into a bluish color.
