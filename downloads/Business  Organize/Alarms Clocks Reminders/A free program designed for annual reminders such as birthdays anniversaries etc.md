**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program is designed for annual reminders such as birthdays, anniversaries, etc. The program provides a simple database entry dialog box for all your reminders. When the program detects that it is time for the alarm for the reminder (for example, three days before the reminder), an alarm dialog box appears with an accompanying sound alert. The dialog can be "snoozed" for a selectable duration. 

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
