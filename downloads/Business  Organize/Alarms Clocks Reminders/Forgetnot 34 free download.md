**Publisher's Description**  
  

This program is designed for annual reminders such as birthdays,
anniversaries, etc. The program provides a simple database entry dialog box
for all your reminders. When the program detects that it is time for the alarm
for the reminder (for example, three days before the reminder), an alarm
dialog box appears with an accompanying sound alert. The dialog can be
"snoozed" for a selectable duration.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
