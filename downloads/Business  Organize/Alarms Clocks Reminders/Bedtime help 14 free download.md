**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bedtime Help is a useful program designed to help you go to bed at a
reasonable time.

It allows you to set up bedtime reminders for up to 5 hours before you want to
go to bed, displaying them at the interval you choose.

You can choose to display a message at bedtime, have your computer shut down,
hibernate or log off immediately or do so a specified amount of minutes after
bedtime. The program also includes an "Addict mode" for those who tend to
change their mind and regret it later ;)

**WhatA's New in version 1.4:**

  * Added the option to log off or hibernate the computer. 
  * Please uninstall any previous versions before updating.
