**Publisher's Description**  
  


MiniMinder gives you a simple, attractive reminder listing of the upcoming events you wish to track. ItA's designed to be small and unobtrusive, but how you size it and where you put it is entirely up to you.

For those who boot their computers daily, MiniMinder shows you your reminders each time you reach the desktop. For those whose computers are always on, MiniMinder can be minimized to the system tray, where it uses a minimum of system resources and then reappears with each new day.

Features include: "yearly", "monthly", and "one-time" events; events such as "2nd Sun" or "4th Thu"; events occurring in increments, such as "every 7 days"; a "Til Done" event for those of us who donA't always get it done the exact day we were supposed to; and the "dayspast" event, which allows you to track the exact number of days transpired since an event in the past.

MiniMinder dynamically adjusts to your system settings each time itA's run, so no matter where in the world you are, your reminders will show up using your local system date settings.
