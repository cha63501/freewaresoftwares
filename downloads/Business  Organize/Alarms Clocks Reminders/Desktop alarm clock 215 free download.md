**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free Windows Desktop Alarm Clock - very small and fast standalone application.
It does not require any registration for download, decompression or
installation. Just download it and run it. It takes around 0% of the processor
time (you can check it with Ctrl+Alt+Del in your Task Manager) and almost
nothing from your system memory. You can set the alarm and hide it in the
system tray to free the screen space as well. It will pop up automatically
when the alarm goes on
