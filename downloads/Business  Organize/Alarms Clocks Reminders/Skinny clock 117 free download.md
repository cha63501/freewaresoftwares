**Publisher's Description**  
  

Skinny Clock is a freeware utility helping you to show date and time the way
you like it. One way to watch the time is a clock window, whose look can be
adjusted via a skin.

There are several pre-made skins available within installation, or you can
even design your own skins. Each skin can contain info about its author and it
is recognized by all Skinny Clock versions, so that you can become a famous
clock skin designer;o). The clock window supports alpha transparency at the
window and skin levels, as well as input transparency. The second way to watch
the time is to override the taskbar clock to show the time using format and
font of your choice.

Clock skins can be created using captions with formatting strings to display
current time, polyline vector primitives, and bitmaps with alpha channels.
Every element of the skin is drawn anti-aliased, and with designer-defined
alpha. Number of elements composing the skin is not limited, and the structure
of easy-to-understand skin-definition file allows you to specify the overlay
order of the skin elements.

Skinny Clock is available in English, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and
Swedish. It is possible to create and use your own translation.
