**Publisher's Description**  
  

Phatsoft TMR is a lightweight and easy to use utility to schedule reminder
messages or actions (like shutting down or restarting your computer, opening a
file, playing audio, starting an application, opening a web page, and more) at
a given date and time. Unlike other applications TMR is built upon the Windows
Task Scheduler so it wont waste your system resources by running in the
background. Tasks can be scheduled easily with few clicks, or from the command
line.
