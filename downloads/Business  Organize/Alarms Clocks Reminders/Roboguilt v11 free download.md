**Publisher's Description**  
  

There are a variety of good tools to help remind you of the events that you
really want to remember. RoboGuilt is the first tool designed to help you
remember the things you are sort of trying to forget.

RoboGuilt keeps track of a series of events and activities and each day asks
you whether or not you have completed everything for that day. If there are
some things you didnAt manage to do, it sends emails to all the people on your
guilt list letting them know what you didnAt achieve.

This may sound cruel, but itA's a great motivator. No longer can you pretend
that you exercise three times a week without fail, or that you did remember to
send that birthday card to your aunt, or do your monthly defrosting of the
refrigerator. Share your sloth and procrastination with your friends.
