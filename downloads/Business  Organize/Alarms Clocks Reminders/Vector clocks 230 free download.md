**Publisher's Description**  
  

A fully scalable desktop alarm clock that can be placed anywhere on your
screen, rotated with total freedom, resized to any scale and set in 3D
perspective view without losing any quality.

Vector Clock is customizable. There are detailed Clock Options in the
settings. It also nicely integrates with Your desktop - You can choose to pin
the clock to desktop, use it as a normal window, keep it on top or even force
it to foreground (when in click-through mode). Plus some other options, such
as "hide on mouse over", "start with Windows" and "clock transparency"
configuration.

Alarm function lets you set up message and sound to play on due time (wav,
mp3, midi). You can use it also as a simple countdown timer - after checking
on the "Now plus" option, clock will compute a future alarm time based on
delay you define (eg. after 5 minutes).

Time Zones allows You to set each clock into the different Time Zone (eg. New
York, Paris, Tokyo). This way, You can have a handy World Clock on Your
desktop. Date on each clock indicates, if there is yesterday, today or
tomorrow. Clock in time zone automatically computes shift of Daylight Time
Saving (DST). Time zone labels can be customized.

This download includes several clocks that are portable. Simply run the .exe
file.
