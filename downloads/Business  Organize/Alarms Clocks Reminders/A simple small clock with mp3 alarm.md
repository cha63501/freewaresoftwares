**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is a simple, little clock with custom alarm. Alarms can be M3U playlist files, MP3 files, VOC, WAV, anything Windows Media Player can handle. 

Video is also possible, but just the sound will be played back. Repeat and shuffle are supported. Alarms can very easily be rescheduled (snoozed) as they go off.

**What's New in version 2.0.2:**

  * Changed date display to more useful format: eg. "TUE 25-08" instead of "25-08-09" 
  * Added alarm sound preview
