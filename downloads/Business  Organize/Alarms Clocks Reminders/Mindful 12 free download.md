**Publisher's Description**  
  

Mindful combines an event reminder and a mini calendar in one system-tray
application. Define your own events and/or select from the list of 72
predefined common events. Use Mindful to be reminded of appointments,
anniversaries, and any occasion, recurring or not, that you may find useful to
remember. Position the mouse over the system-tray icon to have the next-
approaching event on your list displayed in a hint. Right-click the icon in
the system tray and then select "Show Calendar" to display a mini calendar.
Minimize it and it will remain in your system tray ready for you to use again
whenever you need it. If your computer stays on overnight, Mindful
automatically updates your list of events in the first minute of the new day
and displays your list of events so you can be aware of this change the next
time you look at your computer screen.
