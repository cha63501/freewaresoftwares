**Publisher's Description**  
  

**UserHealth** is for all computer users that spend several hours in front of the computer without breaks or pauses. It is also ideal for everybody that has difficulties in going to bed in time.  
  
You can say that the purpose of this program is to be your silent health and
sleep supervisor! What UserHealth actually will do is provide you with
**regular health, pause, and go to bed messages.** The messages can be
displayed like small popup windows in the right corner (Almost like a MSN
login popup) or if you prefer a topmost window or just sound feedback. The
messages will contain suggestions about pauses and small exercise that the
user can do to stimulate the body. **But the main purpose is to draw attention
to the user that he or she has been using the computer for a long time and
maybe need to take a break.**  
  
UserHealth keeps track of your **active computer usage time.** It is then used
to display statistics to you about how much time you have been active on the
computer. (It will be stored locally on your disk and will not be sent or
displayed to anyone else).  
  
UserHealth will also provide you with a **"Computer shutdown feature".** This
feature will log off/shutdown your computer on a given time. This will help
you go to bed and prevent you from waste to many hours of the night doing
nothing on the computer.
