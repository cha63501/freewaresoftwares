Big Stretch is a free simple reminder tool that prompts a user to take regular breaks and helps prevent the symptoms of RSI. Alternatively, you can use it as a simple reminder to notify you when itA's time for your coffee break! 

The program will sit happily in your system tray (where the little icons are in the bottom right hand corner of your screen.) until a predefined time period of your choice arrives at which point a "balloon" will appear offering either RSI tips and advice or a message of your choosing.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html). 

**WhatA's New in version 1.1:**

  * New Feature: Added advanced option to disable/enable alerts when idle 
  * Other minor Windows 7 related bugs fixed
