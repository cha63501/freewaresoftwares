**Publisher's Description**  
  

Timer is an easy to use, and feature-packed Timing application that has the
ability to preform count-up, count-down, and count-up-to functions. It has
support for the time of day, and can support times that are days, months, even
years in the future.

"Time of day" timers can be saved and resumed when the application restarts.
It allows the user to shutdown the computer when the timer has ended, as well
as notifying the user that the end time is approaching at a user-set interval.
When the timer ends, a custom message can be displayed, as well as an alarm
can sound, or a custom sound file can be played.

You can save timers as presets and recall them later. In addition, you will be
able to control Timer using the interface or keyboard commands.

It also has a mini mode function which reduces the window into a space-saving
layout with only the necessary features, and a tray applet for hidden
background use. It has a built-in "Check for Updates" feature, which is
streamlined and user friendly.

Help documentation is provided and can be accessed through the options panel,
aboutbox, or by pressing "F1".

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
