**Publisher's Description**  
  

Springli Timer is an useful utility that can act as a count down timer with an
Alarm sound and message or a stop watch. Both Modes allow pausing, and both
minimized and "tiny" modes. The reason we wrote this little utility is because
we were trying to make a video within the 10 minute YouTube limit and we just
wanted a quick free timer program. We tried a couple popular ones but they
either made our AVG virus protection light up or they installed unwanted
Toolbars in our Internet Explorer even when we opted NOT to install the pesky
things. Well, this frustrated me personally enough to do something about it.
So... Here you have it... a FREE timer application with no strings attached or
unwanted digital badness: Just quality!

Why did we call it Springli Timer? Aside from being my wife and business
partnerA's name, Springli had a lot of say in how this tool should look and
perform because she has used various timer applications (I had no idea) and we
made sure to not include the things she found frustrating and we added the
things she found to be most useful. I think now we can make them videos under
ten minutes pretty easy!
