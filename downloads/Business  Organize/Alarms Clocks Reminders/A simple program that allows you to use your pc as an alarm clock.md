**Publisher's Description**  
  


DSW Alarm is a tiny application that turns your PC or laptop into an alarm clock. You can have up to 3 alarms each with their own time and alert settings. Alarms can either beep the PC Speaker or play a music/sound file on your computer. DSW Alarm can stay running in the System Tray, so you can "set and forget", and the alarms you set will still sound.
