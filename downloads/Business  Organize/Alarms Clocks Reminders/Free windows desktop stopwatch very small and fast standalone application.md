Free Windows Desktop Stopwatch - very small and fast standalone application for measuring time intervals. It does not require any registration for download, decompression or installation. Just download it and run it. 

It takes around 0% of the processor time (you can check it with Ctrl+Alt+Del in your Task Manager) and almost nothing from your system memory. The stopwatch is a clock which can be used for measuring the time interval between two events, the time you have spent for a project on your computer, to check how fast a program runs or anything else you can think of.
