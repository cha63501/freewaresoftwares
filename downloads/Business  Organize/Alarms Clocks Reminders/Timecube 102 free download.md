**Publisher's Description**  
  

The TimeCube displays a small rotating cube, displaying the current date and
time, directly on your desktop. OpenGL is used for quite some special effects:
specular highlights, real time bump mapping and cube map reflections.

The cube is partially transparent, so you can see the window contents behind
it (sometimes you have to look closely though). It can be dragged around on
the desktop with the left mouse button.

Use the right mouse button to get a menu where you can set preferences as well
as install it to start when windows starts if you want. Closing the cube is
also done that way.

**Requirements:** You need Windows 2000 or better (XP, Vista) and an OpenGL 2.0 compatible graphics card. If you get error messages regarding shaders you should try to update your graphics driver first. The time cube has 8 different shaders compiled into it, and the best looking one that works on your graphics card will be chosen.

**Installation:** Download the .zip file and extract the exe file. Run the executable. It does not change anything on your system, it will only set some registry values to store its settings.

**Uninstall:** Remove the downloaded zip file and the exe file, wherever you extracted it.

**System Requirements:**

  * OpenGL 2.0 compatible graphics card
