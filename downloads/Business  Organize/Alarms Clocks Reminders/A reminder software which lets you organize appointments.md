**Publisher's Description**  
  


Nik of Time is a reminder software that I created. This was originally designed as a prototype to a Gauge Recalibration Scheduling Software that IA'm making for a Diecasting Company. The basic principle was the same so I thought I would make this first and solve any teething problems. It has a pretty simple purpose with a simple user interface. The details and descriptions are below: 

FYI, Support is just an email away : nikhil.menon87@gmail.com

**Features:**

  * The ability to store up to 10000 different reminders. 
  * Periodic notifications up to a week in advance of the scheduled date. 
  * Background service which will popup reminder notifications as and when the time arrives. 
  * Notification on system startup of upcoming reminders. 
  * Capability to Backup and restore the database should any unforeseen errors occur. 
  * Minimal resource consumption. DoesnA't take a toll on the RAM or CPU. 

**Future Enhancements:**

  * Categorization of Reminders 
  * Automatic restore on error occurrence
