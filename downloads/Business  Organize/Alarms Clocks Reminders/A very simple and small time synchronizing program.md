**Publisher's Description**  
  


Neutron is a very simple and small time synchronizing program that retrieves the accurate time from one of several specialized time servers on the Internet. Once the network time has been retrieved the program can set your computerA's clock to match it. 

Options in the program enable you to automatically obtain the time from the time server and set your clock appropriately at program startup. It is also possible to have the program automatically exit after the time has been set and so is ideal for placing a shortcut in your Startup folder to sync your clock when your computer is started.

Neutron uses the standard Time protocol (UDP port 37). The time retrieved from the network time server is given as the number of seconds since midnight on January 1st 1900. Since the protocol only allows accuracy down to the second you may not get the most accurate time possible but it is usually good enough to always be within about half a second of "true" time. Network latency is accommodated in the calculations involved in setting your computer clock.

**What's New in version 1.07:**

  * Added a message box warning for Vista users if the time couldn't be synchronized due to lack of rights to change the time.
