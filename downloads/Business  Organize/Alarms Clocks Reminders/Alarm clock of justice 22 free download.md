**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Alarm Clock of Justice is a computer alarm clock that can wake your
computer from standby or hibernation to play a customizable alarm. By waking
up from standby and hibernation your PC does not have to be turned on all
night--and neither do its cooling fans. The alarm can consist of
songs/videos/websites/programs or any other kind of file, talking reminders,
and volume effects (fade in/out, random, unmute, etc.).

Snooze is fully supported in the new release. An Insomniac mode will try to
keep you from shutting down your computer for a specified period time. The new
backup alarm uses your full volume to play the Alarm Clock of Justice song if
your regular alarm fails--it has saved me a couple times. Different parts of
the alarm can now be timed; for example, a song can start playing 10 seconds
after the reminder displays.
