**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free Windows Desktop Stopwatch - very small and fast standalone application
for measuring time intervals. It does not require any registration for
download, decompression or installation. Just download it and run it.

It takes around 0% of the processor time (you can check it with Ctrl+Alt+Del
in your Task Manager) and almost nothing from your system memory. The
stopwatch is a clock which can be used for measuring the time interval between
two events, the time you have spent for a project on your computer, to check
how fast a program runs or anything else you can think of.
