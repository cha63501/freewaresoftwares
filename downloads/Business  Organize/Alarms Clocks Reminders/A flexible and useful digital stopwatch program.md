**Publisher's Description**  
  


SnapTimePro is probably one of the most flexible and useful Digital Stopwatch programs available for Windows computers. You can change the timing resolution at any time (selectable between 1/100 second and 1 second), and the application includes cycle-rate (cycles/second and seconds/cycle) and speed (kph or mph) measurement modules. 

Other key features are: The ability to A'snapA' (capture) the time at any moment (like the split/lap control of a conventional stopwatch). Automatic assignment of percentage weights to captured times - these weights continuously adjust as new times are recorded.

In the SnapTimePro Report, you can add a comment to each snapped time to indicate what the time means. This can be done at any stage - as each time is snapped, or afterwards. You can also mark which times you would like excluded from calculations. You can A'rewindA' the stopwatch back or A'fast-forwardA' the time, and begin timing from that point.

When you do this, the timing results already in the SnapTimePro Report automatically adjust. Automatic calculation of shortest, longest and average time gaps. Extensive reporting capabilities - you can produce a CSV textfile of the raw timing data, a document-like, formatted textfile of the timing results, or a formatted Word document of the timing results. You can save and load Timing Sessions.

User-definable system-wide hotkeys - instead of using the mouse, you can start, stop, reset the stopwatch, snap the time and invoke the SnapTimePro menu from within any other application by means of keyboard hotkeys of your choice, even if the main SnapTimePro Control Panel is not visible. Control over mouse response - if you use the mouse to start, stop and reset the stopwatch, and to snap times, SnapTimePro lets you decide whether the controls should activate as you press the mouse button down, or as you release the mouse button. Control over Display appearance, transparency and positioning - you can adjust these at any stage.
