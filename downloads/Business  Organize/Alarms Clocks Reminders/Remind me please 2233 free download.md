Remind-Me-Please is a freeware reminder program which will give you advance
warning of upcoming events, appointments, TV programs, movies, birthdays and
so on. Enter one-off or repeating events: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and
specials like A'Every two weeks from 1/1/2005A' or A'Third Sunday of each
monthA'.

Once itA's set up properly itA'll give you a splash screen listing all
upcoming events whenever you reboot your computer, followed by a splash screen
for items due NOW.

As an added bonus, this program will also run in a networked environment. You
can allocate a username to each machine and point each one to a central shared
database. Anyone can then enter A'SHAREDA' events (e.g. Family outings,
company meetings) which will show up on everyone elseA's screen. Private
reminders will only show on the PC which they were entered on.
