**Publisher's Description**  
  


IA'm not a professional programmer. I just tried to satisfy my own needs.  
  
As long as I searched on the net, all free desktop timers are just a mimicry of the real timer, though the computers are equipped with better keyboards than that of the handy gizmo. 

With this one, you can enter the numbers with hours (:), minutes (A'), and seconds (") symbols and freely add comments to help you remember what kind of job youA're currently on.

It is only for Windows, and requires .NET framework.

P.S. The icon file, which is ironically larger than the code itself, is K timer by Umut Pulat. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-x-Final_program_16026.html).
