**Publisher's Description**  
  

This is a simple program to help keep track of the amount of time spent on
projects.  
  
It displays the amount of time that has been spent on a project for today,
this week, and in total.  
The time for the day and week automatically reset back to 0. The beginning of
a week is determined when a project is started. For example, if you start a
new project on Tuesday the week timer will reset to 0 every Tuesday.  
  
You can also add time to the total time in the amount of hours (doesnA't have
to be a whole number such as 1.23).  
  
To save the logged time, simply Stop the timer.  
  
If you ever need to modify a projectA's save file, it can be opened as a text
document and goes a follows:

  * project name
  * todayA's hours
  * todayA's minutes
  * todayA's seconds
  * this weekA's hours
  * this weekA's minutes
  * this weekA's seconds
  * total hours
  * total minutes
  * total seconds
  * day of the year this week started
  * day of the year for next week
