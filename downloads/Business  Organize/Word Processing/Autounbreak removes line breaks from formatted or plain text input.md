**Publisher's Description**  
  


AutoUnbreak removes line breaks from formatted (or plain) text input. This is useful if you want to reformat a text document, where lines have been cut short, e.g. when copying text from an Adobe PDF file to a word processor. Thus, the program removes any extraneous lines. 

AutoUnbreak was designed to remove these carriage returns/ line breaks in a smart manner. For instance it will try to reconstruct any hyphenated words, and it will not merge lines if they e.g. are a part of a numbered or bulleted list. AutoUnbreak is customizable, and you can change its "rules" by altering the plain text files "merge.set" and "exceptions.set" to fit your needs.

The program gets its input from the clipboard, and should retain any (text) formatting.
