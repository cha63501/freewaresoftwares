**Publisher's Description**  
  

Shalom Help Maker (SHM) is a Windows help file editor that does not need MS
Word. It supports images, popup windows, links to other pages, web pages,
E-mail addresses etc., and has automatic updating of links (jumps to other
pages) when pages are rearranged or deleted, listing of unused bitmaps and
popup pages, listing of links to the present page ... and lots more.

SHM makes old-fashioned hlp files, not chm files (HTML based help files). It
runs on all Windows versions, including XP.

Unlike other help file creators, Shalom Help Maker works like any ordinary
editor and therefore has practically no learning curve. You donA't have to
know anything about help file making. Just start typing, insert pictures and
write page headers. Hit F4 to get a preview of a page or F9 to compile (make)
the whole help file. You donA't need MS Word to write help files! Shalom Help
Maker (SHM) is your editor and you produce the help file with SHM and the help
compiler (separate download found on the developerA's [download
page](http://www.danish-shareware.dk/soft/shelpmbeta/index.html)).
