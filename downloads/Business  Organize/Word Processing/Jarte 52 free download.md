**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Jarte word processor includes only the features likely to be needed by
real people. Jarte is designed for students, writers, small business people,
and home users. But what really makes Jarte special is the unique way it makes
the features that are included easily accessible.

Features include RTF and DOC support, OLE support, visual header & footer
designer, clip history, online reference bar, tabbed document access, spell
check, page breaks, print preview, multi-level undo & redo, customizable
background, bookmarking, and many more. A detailed Help file is included.

You expect a word processor to be able to handle Word documents, font and
paragraph formatting, spell checking, print preview, and more. While Jarte
