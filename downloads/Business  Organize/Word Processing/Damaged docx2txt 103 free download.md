**Publisher's Description**  
  

Using a GUI front end and a Perl coded back end, Damaged DOCX2TXT will extract
the text even from damaged or corrupted Word 2007 docx files where Word 2007
itself fails to salvage text. It can also be simply used as a viewer of the
text in a docx file without having Word 2007.

Word 2007 files are really zipped collections of mostly XML files. XML is not
tolerant of file corruption. The text from a Word 2007 document is found in
the document.xml file within the zipped collection. From the errors generated
it appears that Word 2007 is using a fairly corrupt intolerant XML reading
algorithm or module to even salvage text from this XML file within corrupt
Word 2007 docx files.

Damaged DOCX2TX uses an unzipper which is tolerant of XML file corruption and
uses Perl coding to extract the text from the document.xml file where all of
the unformatted text resides in a docx file. Since this Perl coding does not
use a standard XML reading applet or module but simply removes the hypertext
around the text, the result is more less perfectly extracted text until that
part of the document.xml file where the corruption starts, is reached. Word
2007 on the other hand appears to return no results if it encounters any
errors at all in the document.xml file.
