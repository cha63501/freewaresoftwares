**Publisher's Description**  
  


JBase is a database program designed to be used with TIFF and MODI documents. File attributes and text are extracted from the document images and inserted into a Microsoft SQL Compact Edition 3.5 database. 

There, documents can be grouped and organized and additional identifying fields can be filled-in as needed. Documents can then be searched by Windows file attributes, user assigned attributes or for text located within the document. The actual files can be located anywhere on the local machine or even on the network. 

JScan 2.0, an OCR tool for TIFF and MODI files, is fully integrated within JBase, providing a comprehensive solution for dealing with document images.

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows XP SP2 or Windows Vista*; 
  * [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html) or greater; 
  * Microsoft Office 2003 or greater.
