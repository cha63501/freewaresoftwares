**Publisher's Description**  
  

Slate is a full fledged local language word processor. The interface language
may be interchanged between English and Hindi, IndiaA's national language, and
local language fonts are installed during setup.

Slate incorporates all formatting features found in todayA's word processors-
bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, superscript and subscript; font
family, size and color change, and centre, left, right and justified paragraph
alignment. Slate also allows for the insertion and manipulation of tables and
images into documents.

Slate is unique as it saves documents in the HTML file format. This makes
Slate documents universal, as they can be viewed on just about any platform
with a simple web browser- without the need of Slate even being installed. No
knowledge of HTML is required to use Slate.
