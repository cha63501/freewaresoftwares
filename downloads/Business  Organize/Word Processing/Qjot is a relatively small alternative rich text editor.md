**Publisher's Description**  
  


QJot is a small portable alternative rich text editor that reads and writes .doc files, inserts images and more. It is basically meant to serve as a good WordPad replacement. It supports Unicode and runs under Windows 2000 and Windows XP. 

Its native format is RTF, but it can open, edit and save Word and WordPerfect files (though not with all of their features). It can be used with any script that is supported by Windows and for which a font and a keyboard driver are installed, including right-to-left scripts. 

QJot is fully portable and can be run from a USB flash drive.
