TKexe Kalendar enables the creation of photo calendars of any size.

Customization is very easy: position the elements by dragging them with the
mouse and change the settings of any element by double-clicking it. 20 images
can be added to a month. You can rotate the images and add special effects to
them. Weeks can start on Sunday or Monday, and you can add your personal
events. Each calendar page can be customized separately, but the settings can
be applied for all months. Create calendars in any language. Select national
holidays from 10 countries. Save your customized calendar to an image file or
print it to paper.

The software is available in English, German, Italian, Spanish, Czech,
