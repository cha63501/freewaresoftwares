**Publisher's Description**  
  

Calendar 2000 is a small utility that will display a monthly calendar on the
Windows desktop. The calendar is similar to the one found in most checkbooks.

You can also define your own holidays and important dates, but Calendar 2000
is not a full-blown time scheduler. Instead use Calendar 2000 to quickly check
the date or calculate the day on which a certain date occurs.

Monthly calendars from January 1583 to December 3000 can be displayed and
printed using this handy desktop utility.

Calendar 2000 is a very small program and can easily be configured to be run
directly from the Taskbar icon tray.
