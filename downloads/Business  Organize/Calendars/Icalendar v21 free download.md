**Publisher's Description**  
  

**Easy Date Editor**  
By clicking on the small orange triangle in the lower right hand corner of
every day, you can easily add or remove a reminder to the specified date.

**Easy to Use Interface**  
The new UI is pretty much only a calendar. We tried to make the other features
(such as the options window) to be able to be hidden on the UI to unclutter
the screen. Also every reminder for the current day is listed on the front
window so that you can easily see what you need to do. If you click on any
date, the selected reminder is shown on the bottom of the iCalendar window for
easier viewing.

**Setup Is Easy**  
All you have to do is download our small installation file from this website.
Click on the Download! link at the top right corner of this page. Once you
have downloaded the installation once, you will never need to come back to the
site to download updates. The program will automatically download them for
you!

  * Easy to use interface
