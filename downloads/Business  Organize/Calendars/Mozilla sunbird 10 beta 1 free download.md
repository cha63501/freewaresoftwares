**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Sunbird Project is a redesign of the Mozilla Calendar component. The goal
is to produce a cross platform standalone calendar application based on
MozillaA's XUL user interface language.

Sunbird is the standalone form of the Mozilla Calendar. Both use the same base
code so their functionality is the same and they share the same bugs and bug
fixes. The intended user is someone who uses Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla
Thunderbird and wants a calendar application based on Mozilla.
