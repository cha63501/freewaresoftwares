**Publisher's Description**  
  


CraftCalendar was written in Java and takes advantage of the freeware Java database One$DB. It was written for those interested in lunar and seasonal cycles, and to allow personal events to also be entered. For fun, a simple journal was added so longer personal notes can be entered. The uploading of lunar and seasonal cycles is optional, and the calendar can be used simply for personal events. 

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
