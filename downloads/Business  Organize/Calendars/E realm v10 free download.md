**Publisher's Description**  
  

E-ReAlm is an useful application that allows you to create programmed alarms
to help you remember all your dates and appointments. This alarms can be set
to go off once only, or once a year, a month, a week, a dayA at any hour of
the day. You can also add a text to the alarm, as well as a sound that will be
played when the alarm goes off.

The interface was designed to be the most intuitive and simple, as you can get
to all options from the main window. The hidden mode and the icon tray menu,
allows you to have E-ReAlm opened (so that alarms can go off) while you work
with your computer, without having the programAs window in screen.
