**Publisher's Description**  
  

UKA's Kalender is a MS Windows program intended to remind you of upcoming
events and todos. There are several views for your dates that are organized
similar to a calendar sheet. Dates and appointments can be entered into the
calendar via an input form. You can enter a forewarn time, so as long as
"UKA's Kalender" is running in the background youA'll be reminded of your
dates as soon as the forewarn time is reached.

Independent from the calendar function there is also a todo list where you can
enter tasks with a deadline and a forewarn time. If the forewarn time is
reached, "UKA's Kalender" will inform you of the due tasks with symbols and
colors.
