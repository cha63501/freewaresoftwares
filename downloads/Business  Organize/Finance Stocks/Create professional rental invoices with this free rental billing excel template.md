**Publisher's Description**  
  


This free rental invoice template is also called rental payment invoice, monthly rental invoice, rental billing format, or invoice for rental payment. For example, it can be used for creating apartment rental invoices or property rental invoices. The invoice form provides a sample of rental bill and rental receipt. 

Compared to the default invoice template shipped with Uniform Invoice Software, the most significant change on this invoice template is that it added two new columns, start month and end month. These columns allow you to detail the date range a house or apartment is rent. Professional landlords or rental agencies will have a very proper structure for their rent payment system, including issuing a rent invoice to the customer on a monthly basis or as per contract agreement. The modifications implemented in this template suit the requirements well with an intuitive Excel invoice form.

Tenants who frequently settle their rent late may be blacklisted with a poor reference will find him having difficulty in securing good places to rent in the future. A rent invoice is then useful to the tenant as it serves as a reminder to settle the rent before or on the due payment date. The rent invoice may be standard for every month or request of rent settlement. The rent invoice template offered here provides a discount or concession field on the bottom of the form, which can be used to apply discount to tenants who pay in time. It can also be modified for applying late payment interest, by changing the rate from negative to a positive rate.

In general a rent invoice template should have: landlordAs / Agency name, landlordAs / agencyAs contact number, tenantAs name, rental address, month of payment (could be detailed on invoice body). All these are implemented in this billing form.

This invoice template requires Microsoft Excel/Office 2003 and higher versions.
