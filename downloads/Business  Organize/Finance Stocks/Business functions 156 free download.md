**Publisher's Description**  
  

Business Functions is a free function library (500+ functions) for Microsoft
Excel designed to make business plans, budgets, structured financings and
cashflows:

  * more flexible ... 
  * more accurate ... 
  * faster to build ... 
  * quicker to run ... 
  * less error prone ... 
  * easier to understand ... 
  * more robust ... 
  * easier to maintain .. 

ItA's based on the principle that using a purpose-built function in a cell is
more transparent, reliable, flexible and accurate than an overly long Excel
formula.

This principle has been extended to a comprehensive projections functions that
project cashflows and accruals with a high degree of daycount accuracy.

Up to 500 or so functions in C++ do the dirty work of projecting costs and
revenues, coping with time periods, growth etc.

As a Business Functions user you also have access to the
[templates](http://www.businessfunctions.com/templates.php), all built with
Business Functions.

Version 1.41 and above merges all the editions of BF into a single package,
which means that for the first time the Real Estate, Banking and Petroleum
functions are free. It also allows partial view of C++ code via the Function
Finder, and includes our consolidation tool Cashflow Administrator. This is a
toolkit for industry-strength modeling, and is completely free.
