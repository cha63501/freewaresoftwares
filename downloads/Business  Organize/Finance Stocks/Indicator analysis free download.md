**Publisher's Description**  
  

This is the final project of Omer, Ran and Shay, supervised by Tal Hassner.

Our goal was to provide a FREE tool to allow stock analyzers to download mass,
historical, stock data and perform technical analysis on it.

Included is a tool which allows you to download stock data (in original format
as well as XML) from Yahoo! Finance according to a list of symbols or you can
use a sample symbol list from NYSE.

ScreenshotThe program is bundled with several basic technical analysis
indicators, but itA's highly extendible and allows programmers to add their
own indicators to the application.
