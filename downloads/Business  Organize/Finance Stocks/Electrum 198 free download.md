Electrum is a Bitcoin client designed to prevent users from losing valuable
coins in a backup mistake or computer failure. Your Bitcoin wallet can easily
be recovered by using a custom secret phrase.

Since Electrum does not download the Bitcoin blockchain and uses a remote
server, it starts immediately when run.

**Features:**

  * Safe: Private keys are not stored or sent to the server 
  * Multiple public servers available 
  * Supports exporting of private keys to other Bitcoin clients 
  * Your wallet can be used on multiple computers as it will auto-synchronize
