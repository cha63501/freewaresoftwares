**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is called a simple invoice template because it does not include an important column that appears on almost all invoice templates designed at InvoicingTemplates.com, i.e. the Description field / column on the invoice body. Although a clear description of products sold / service performed is a basic requirement of a general invoice, there are in fact some business where the description is not practically required or possible, such as selling of machine parts. In such situations a serial# or product# is more meaningful than a description. This simple invoice template is designed with exactly such situation in mind. 

The simple invoice format is designed for standard A4 paper. Since we removed the Description column, and a Serial# or Product# is usually short, we placed two groups of "Product#, Quantity, Unit Price, Line Total" columns side by side on the invoice body. This makes it possible to place 30 items on 15 lines on a single page of a simple invoice.

The simple invoice layout includes both a "Bill To" section for client information, and a "Ship To" section for shipping address information. If you are a service business that does not require the "Ship To" section, visit our web site for a variant of this invoice template that has the "Ship To" section removed.

The simple invoice form has a Taxable column, implemented as a checkbox column, placed outside the printable section. Each checkbox on the column is corresponding to an item on the invoice body. If a check box is selected, the amount of the corresponding item is counted when calculating tax.

The simple invoice sample has two taxes defined on the bottom of the form, PST and GST. You can easily change the tax names and rates by typing in your own tax names and rates - this will not break the Excel formulas that calculates taxes and amounts.
