**Publisher's Description**  
  


AdyTicker Light tracks your favorite shares, the value of your portfolio and can alert you.  
  
Manage your own list of shares and the share prices and volumes are grabbed automatically from the Yahoo! Finance site.   
Create your own portfolio and see how your investments are growing.  
The alert system will warn you as soon as a share reaches certain levels (price, volume, ...).   
  
The software can be run in 3 different modes: 

  * a normal window with full details about each share 
  * a scrolling ticker-bar share-symbol, latest price and price change 
  * running in the background and only alerting you when some price or volume level has been reached.
