**Publisher's Description**  
  

MultiBit is a lightweight and secure application that makes it easy to perform
Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin is a new form of general purpose digital
currency that makes online transactions easy and more versatile.

The multi-language program is easy to install, and you can have it running
within five minutes. It is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac operating
systems.

When you launch MultiBit for the first time, it creates a new wallet called
"multibit.wallet" in the user data directory. You can rename the wallet by
clicking on its descriptive text and typing the name you want.

You can create as many wallets as you want, which will appear in a side panel
called AWallets.A You activate a desired wallet by clicking on it, and you
will see its balance on the top left part of the application window. On the
upper right part, you will see currencies and their exchange rates. When you
re-launch the application, it automatically opens the wallets you used
previously.

Whenever you open a wallet, MultiBit synchronizes it automatically to give you
the latest transactions. Synchronization takes about a minute only. You can
open and close a wallet via the File Menu. Note that when you close a wallet,
you will not see it in MultiBit although it will still be stored on your
computer.

The application makes your transactions secure by encrypting all private keys
on your computer or USB drive.

MultiBit is "donationware," so you can contribute towards its server costs and
improvement when you find it useful.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com).
