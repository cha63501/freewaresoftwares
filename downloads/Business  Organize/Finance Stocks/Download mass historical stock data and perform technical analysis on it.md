**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is the final project of Omer, Ran and Shay, supervised by Tal Hassner. 

Our goal was to provide a FREE tool to allow stock analyzers to download mass, historical, stock data and perform technical analysis on it.

Included is a tool which allows you to download stock data (in original format as well as XML) from Yahoo! Finance according to a list of symbols or you can use a sample symbol list from NYSE.

ScreenshotThe program is bundled with several basic technical analysis indicators, but itA's highly extendible and allows programmers to add their own indicators to the application.
