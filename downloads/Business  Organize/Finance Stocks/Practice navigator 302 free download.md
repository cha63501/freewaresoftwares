**Publisher's Description**  
  

Have you ever wondered how much income you could reliably maintain from your
investments and wished that you could have a practice run? The Practice
Navigator allows you to do just that.

It simulates real-life stock market variability so that you can practice
making investment decisions without the risk of financial loss. You will
decide how your capital is allocated, how much income to withdraw, and when to
sell stocks.

As with real financial markets, some of the simulated Monte Carlo scenarios
will be more difficult than others. See if you can maintain your desired
income for up to 30 years. Compare your results to a systematic withdrawals
benchmark.

**Requires:** Microsoft Excel 2000 and higher or compatible spreadsheet program.
