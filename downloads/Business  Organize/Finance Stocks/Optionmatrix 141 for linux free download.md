**Publisher's Description**  
  

A real-time generalized financial derivatives calculator supporting 136+
theoretical models from open source libraries. Matrices of prices are created
with iterating strikes and/or months. A strike control system can produce
almost any strike. A generalized date engine can calculate re-occurring
distances to any industry used expiration into the future. Timing is accurate
to one second and pricing is re-calculated every second. 9 choices for
computing the cumulative normal distribution. All inputs can be changed real-
time with spin buttons, combo boxes, scale buttons and calendar selection.
