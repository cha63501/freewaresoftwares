XL-EasyGantt is a Simple Project Scheduling and Management Tool that is designed to make use of the popular Microsoft Excel program. By creatively using the Excel macros, formatting and simple filtering features, XL-EasyGantt allows high level schedules to be generated fairly quickly with timeline presentation that is great for pre-sales activities and fast communication between clients and team members who do not have access to Microsoft Project. 

By employing similar columns positioning as Microsoft Project, XL-EasyGantt allows you to easily copy-and-paste the details over to Microsoft Project for further detail planning and work breakdown. Similarly, you can also copy-and-paste from Microsoft Project.
