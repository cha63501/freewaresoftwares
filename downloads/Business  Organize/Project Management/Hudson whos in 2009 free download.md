**Publisher's Description**  
  

HOS-IN 2000 is a professional in-out board program for Windows that allows
everyone on your Local Area Network (especially your receptionist) know where
everyone else is.

With WHOS-IN 2000 there is no more time wasted checking a wall-mounted Office
Board to see if someone is In, Out, or at Lunch... all the information you
need is presented on screen in an easy to read format.

Having a snapshot or status view of your co-workers whereabouts makes it
possible to give better information to callers, and to avoid putting telephone
calls through to employees who are not at their desks. WHOS-IN 2000 also
reduces wasted time when an employee needs to find a co-worker to talk to him
or her.

(WHOS-IN 2000 is free for up to 5 users.)
