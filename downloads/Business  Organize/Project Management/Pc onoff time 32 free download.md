**Publisher's Description**  
  

This free time tracking tool shows the times your computer has been active
during the last 3 weeks, with no previous setup required.

The software doesn't need to run in the background, because Windows OS tracks
logon and logoff/standby times (working hours) by default, and the program
analyses it.

Your working time is displayed graphically and you get an extensive evaluation
of your working times and projects.
