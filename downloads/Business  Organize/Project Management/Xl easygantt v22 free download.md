**Publisher's Description**  
  

XL-EasyGantt is a Simple Project Scheduling and Management Tool that is
designed to make use of the popular Microsoft Excel program. By creatively
using the Excel macros, formatting and simple filtering features, XL-EasyGantt
allows high level schedules to be generated fairly quickly with timeline
presentation that is great for pre-sales activities and fast communication
between clients and team members who do not have access to Microsoft Project.

By employing similar columns positioning as Microsoft Project, XL-EasyGantt
allows you to easily copy-and-paste the details over to Microsoft Project for
further detail planning and work breakdown. Similarly, you can also copy-and-
paste from Microsoft Project.
