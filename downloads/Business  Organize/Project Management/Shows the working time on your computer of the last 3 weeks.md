**Publisher's Description**  
  


This free time tracking tool shows the times your computer has been active during the last 3 weeks, with no previous setup required. 

The software doesn't need to run in the background, because Windows OS tracks logon and logoff/standby times (working hours) by default, and the program analyses it.

Your working time is displayed graphically and you get an extensive evaluation of your working times and projects.
