**Publisher's Description**  
  


Noteliner helps you structure and track your work; it provides a place to record meeting and conversation notes, manage todos, and store key project information that might otherwise be scattered about. It is a simple tool that will not slow you down, but will give you a means to stay on top of what you need to do and remember. 

I developed it originally about 15 years ago and have updated it every few years. From time to time IA've looked for other tools to help me keep track of all the things that I need to do at work but I have found them either too cumbersome--creating work rather than reducing it--or too basic. For no particular reason in early 2010 I decided to clean it up and see if others might find it useful (IA've continued to update it since then). I hope you do! 

Noteliner lets you create a hierarchy of notes. You can give these notes follow-up dates, indicate which ones need attention, assign people, prioritize, or mark them complete. Different views allow you to see all the notes assigned to a particular person, those that need follow-up, attention or are dated. You can also specify which notes are part of a To-Do list and then view all To-Dos across your projects along with other items that need attention.

It is very stable. It saves every minute if changes are made, I havenA't lost data in over a decade. I use it every day at work. I run it on Windows XP but it should be fine on Windows 2000 and more recent. Its written in Visual C++ so it is fast and light weight.
