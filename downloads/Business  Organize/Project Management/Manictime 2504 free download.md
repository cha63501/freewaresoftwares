**Publisher's Description**  
  

ManicTime is a time tracking software which automatically collects data on
your computer usage. It records active and away time, as well as which
applications you used and for how long you used them.

The data ManicTime collects is stored in a local database on your computer.
Once data is collected you can use our simple click and drag feature to
accurately tag how you spent your time. Time tagging allows you to see how you
spent your time based on your own time tags and gives you accurate information
on how efficient you really are.

Because there is so much data available about your computer usage, you are
able to tag spent time for days in the past. Based on this data you are able
to generate various statistics. You can easily find out how much time you
spend behind a computer or how much time you spend browsing the web.
