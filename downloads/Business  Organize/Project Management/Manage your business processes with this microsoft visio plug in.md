**Publisher's Description**  
  


A simple add-on to MicrosoftA(r) Visio, our Free BPMN Modeler allows you to quickly and easily create, view, edit and publish your business processes in a familiar interface while supporting the standard BPMN process notation. 

Using VisioAs powerful diagramming functionality as a base, our plug-in manages activities as AobjectsA rather than flat text - allowing users to augment the information associated with an activity, increasing the depth of their process maps. Moreover, our modeler provides the ability to drill-down within multiple levels of a business process hierarchy, and automatically generate multiple outputs to visualize how processes interact.

**Minimum requirements:** Windows XP, MS Visio 2003 or 2007.
