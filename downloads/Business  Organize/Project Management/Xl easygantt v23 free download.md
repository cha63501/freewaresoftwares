XL-EasyGantt is a Free Project Scheduling and Management Tool that is designed
to make use of the popular Microsoft Excel program. By creatively using the
Excel macros, formatting and simple filtering features, XL-EasyGantt allows
high level schedules to be generated fairly quickly with timeline presentation
that is great for pre-sales activities and fast communication between clients

easily copy-and-paste the details over to Microsoft Project for further detail
planning and work breakdown. Similarly, you can also copy-and-paste from
Microsoft Project.

simplify the tasks of creating the project schedule and to generate the gantt
chart.

  * Auto Calendar Wizard Fast Switching between Weekly and Daily Views 
  * One Click Add New Schedules

  * Better Tasks Inserts with Auto Level Identing
