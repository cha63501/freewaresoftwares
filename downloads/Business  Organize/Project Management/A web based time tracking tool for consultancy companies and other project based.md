**Publisher's Description**  
  


eHour is a webbased time tracking tool for consultancy companies and other project based businesses. 

The primary objective is to keep time tracking as simple and user friendly as possible while still being very effective at measuring and reporting the amount of time your team spends on a project. 

**Features:**

  * create multiple projects per customer, assign multiple employees to the same project
  * have different start and end dates and hourly rates per employee for each project assignment
  * create default projects to which all employees should be assigned (days off, sick leave, etc.) so you can keep track of those hours as well
  * extensive turnover & hours reports on all customers, projects, employees, departments or a selection of them
  * configurable localization and currency. All languages are supported although only English & Dutch translations are availabe
  * separation of employee, reporting and administration role.
  * excel export of all your reports

**WhatA's New in version 1.2.1:**

  * Internet Explorer 8's compatibility mode was not properly overriden. In other words, eHour now properly works with IE8 even when IE8 is set to be in IE7 compatible mode. 
  * The full name of a user (first and last name) is shown in the detailed report 
  * In eHour 1.2 changes were made to how the configured currency to use is stored in the database. 
  * However the default value, when you install eHour for the first time, was not set properly and eHour didn't handle this correctly. The default currency is now set to a US dollar. 
  * The excel export of the detailed report crashed when trying to export a larger data set (more than 200 users). 
  * All the excel exports in the global reporting section returned the 'project export' excel.
