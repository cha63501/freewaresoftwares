**Publisher's Description**  
  

Quicknote is a small, virtual scrapbook to write down an occasional thought, a
plan for the day or an Internet URL.

When not in use, the program hides as a tiny bar on top of your desktop, and
when you hold your mouse over it, the interface will appear. You can type or
copy/paste bits of text and even scribble down simple drawings.

The program also offers some additional features, including an option to start
frequently run programs, encrypt secret texts and even change the system
volume by hotkeys. It also includes an integrated Task-Manager, that allows
you to set reminders for selected notes, and can also shut down your PC at
specified times.

The interface colors can be customized to fit your personal preference and the
program also supports transparency under XP/2000. You can have up to 4
simultaneous scrapbooks and they will be automatically saved.
