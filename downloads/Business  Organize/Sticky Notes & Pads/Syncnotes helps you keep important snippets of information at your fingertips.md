SyncNotes helps you keep you important snippets of information at your fingertips, always. 

SyncNotes allows you to easily store, retrieve and even communicate small pieces of textual information. The SyncNotes System consists of a desktop software that allows you to put up virtual sticky notes on your screen, a web based system that synchronizes all notes from your PC(s) and a WAP based interface to view and add notes when you are on the go.

The SyncNotes Desktop Client: The SyncNotes client is a windows application that allows you to create and manage notes on your desktop computer. The online notes and the local notes store are synchronized periodically every time your computer connects to the Internet. You can put up notes on your desktop, make them stay always on top so that you donA't forget your important reminders; you can even make the notes translucent!

The NoteBox: The NoteBox is where all your notes are stored online, allowing you to the synchronized notes using any web browser just by accessing your SyncNotes.com account. This is also where you log into for getting a clear list view of all your notes, making it easier for cleaning up your notes, archiving them, etc.

SyncNotes Mobile: The SyncNotes Mobile Interface allows you to view, add, edit, or send notes using any internet enabled device, that supports WAP or XHTML, for example your mobile phone, your Pocket PCA or any other PDA. This also makes SyncNotes a more cost efficient way of sending messages than SMS, as the recipient need not have a mobile phone to receive your message.
