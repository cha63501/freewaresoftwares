**Publisher's Description**  
  

StickMeUp is a sticky note application for Windows. It is almost fully
customizable, extremely secure and completely portable. Moreover, it is
extremely resource-friendly!

You may customize almost every aspect of each note, including opacity, the
fonts used in the text and title and color, not to mention dimensions and
location.

StickMeUp can export each note to some popular file formats, such as vNote and
vToDo for easy sending and saving to your mobile phone.

StickMeUp is extremely portable, being comprised only of the executable, the
Notes folder, if you have any saved notes, and a settings file.

Your data is safe with StickMeUp, thanks to our proprietary system, which
divides each note in two separate files, and then encrypts them.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
