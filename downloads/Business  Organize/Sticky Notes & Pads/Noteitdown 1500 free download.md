NoteItDown is a portable application for creating and managing notes of all

Notes can be stored in an user defined folder structure. The font, font size
and colors are changeable for each note. With a RTF-editor each note can be
designed individually. A search function finds notes with a specified text.
Text inside of a note can be found with an incremental search function.

NoteItDown runs in multi user environments as well on USB sticks.
