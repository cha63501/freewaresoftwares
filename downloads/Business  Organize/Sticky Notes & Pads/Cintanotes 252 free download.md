**Publisher's Description**  
  

CintaNotes is a simple program for basic notes keeping that provides a
convenient way to quickly store pieces of information that are collected from
other documents or websites.

All you have to do is select the text to be stored and then press the CTRL+F12
hotkey on your keyboard to create a note. CintaNotes captures the text and
uses the application title as the noteA's title.

Alternatively, you can copy/paste the text into the application and append it
to the list of previous notes. You can optionally assign keyword tags that can
be used to locate and identify notes at a later time.

An instant search feature quickly locates keywords within notes as you type
them. Other features include merging of notes and support for automatic
capturing of Internet links from IE.

**Note:** Registration required for advanced features.
