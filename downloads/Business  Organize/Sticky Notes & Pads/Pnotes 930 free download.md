**Publisher's Description**  
  

Managing your day-to-day life is not an easy job to do. There are so many
things to concern for - housekeeping, shopping, children... And what about
cousinA's birthday you always forget? Or important phone numbers? Undoubtedly
your working place is covered with dusty yellow (or blue, or pink) sticky
notes. If so - PNotes is right for you. Throw the physical stickies away and
replace them with virtual ones on your desktop.

PNotes (Pinned Notes or Portable Notes, use what you prefer) is written
entirely in C and Windows API - so it is fast and light-weight. It has
flexible settings - both for the program in whole and for individual note.
Skins, fonts, colors, alarms, tags, transparency level - all-in-one. Any
portion of noteA's text can be formatted separately.

There is a variety of skins for PNotes and, moreover, you can create your own
one if download PNSkinCreator - a small utility for creation PNotes skins.
Notes can also be skinless, that allows stretching them to any reasonable
size.

You may set the password, which will prevent unauthorized access to program.
In this case you can also store the notes as encrypted files, so even if you
lose your USB stick nobody could read them.

Scheduling is also important feature of PNotes. It is possible to schedule
each note to remind you about significant events by three different ways -
alarm you once, every day at specified time or pester you every specified
interval.

One more PNotes feature - ability to join notes into groups by your choice.
You can create, modify, delete and relocate groups by simple click or drag-
and-drop. Changing group for each note performed by dragging it onto
appropriate group. There is also special group of notes: "Diary".

PNotes is fully Unicode supported and translated into many languages. And,
obviously, it is portable - it leaves no traces in Windows registry and can be
started from any drive (fixed or flash) on any computer. Take your notes with
you to any location.
