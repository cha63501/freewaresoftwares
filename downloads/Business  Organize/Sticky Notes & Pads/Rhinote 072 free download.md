**Publisher's Description**  
  

Rhinote is a simple Python/Tkinter script which provides virtual "sticky-
notes" on your desktop. ItA's handy for jotting down quick notes or holding
copied text that you plan to paste elsewhere later. Text can be cut, copied,
and pasted; and notes can be saved (as plain text) and viewed and/or edited
later, in Rhinote or any other text-editing application. While many such
applications exist for virtually all computing platforms, Rhinote is extremely
simple, lightweight, and "keyboard-friendly."

Rhinote requires Python in order to run. If you donA't have Python installed,
you can download it from [www.python.org](http://www.python.org).
