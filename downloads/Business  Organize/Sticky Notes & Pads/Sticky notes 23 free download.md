**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Sticky Notes application allows you to create electronic sticky notes
directly on your Windows desktop. The Sticky Notes are just like paper post-it
notes for your computer. Jot down tasks, messages, ideas, appointments, phone
numbers, birthdays in a note and stick it on the desktop.

A note can be positioned anywhere you wish, or hidden in your task bar, then
searched and displayed later. Notes can be resized.

The noteA's contents can be formatted to include fonts, colors, transparency
and hyperlinks. Once on screen, notes will remain where placed until closed,
