**Publisher's Description**  
  


CintaNotes is a simple program for basic notes keeping that provides a convenient way to quickly store pieces of information that are collected from other documents or websites. 

All you have to do is select the text to be stored and then press the CTRL+F12 hotkey on your keyboard to create a note. CintaNotes captures the text and uses the application title as the noteA's title.

Alternatively, you can copy/paste the text into the application and append it to the list of previous notes. You can optionally assign keyword tags that can be used to locate and identify notes at a later time.

An instant search feature quickly locates keywords within notes as you type them. Other features include merging of notes and support for automatic capturing of Internet links from IE.

**Note:** Registration required for advanced features.
