**Publisher's Description**  
  


Rhinote is a simple Python/Tkinter script which provides virtual "sticky-notes" on your desktop. ItA's handy for jotting down quick notes or holding copied text that you plan to paste elsewhere later. Text can be cut, copied, and pasted; and notes can be saved (as plain text) and viewed and/or edited later, in Rhinote or any other text-editing application. While many such applications exist for virtually all computing platforms, Rhinote is extremely simple, lightweight, and "keyboard-friendly." 

Rhinote requires Python in order to run. If you donA't have Python installed, you can download it from [www.python.org](http://www.python.org).
