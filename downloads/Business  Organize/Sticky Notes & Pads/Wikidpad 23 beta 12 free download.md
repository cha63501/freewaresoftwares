**Publisher's Description**  
  

wikidPad is a Wiki-like notebook for storing your thoughts, ideas, todo lists,
contacts, or anything else you can think of to write down.

What makes wikidPad different from other notepad applications is the ease with
which you can cross-link your information. Links in a wiki are created by
typing in WikiWords. A WikiWord is any mixed case word typed into the editor.
TodoList or JohnDoe are example WikiWords. The term wiki means "quick" in
Hawaiian, and wikis are all about quickly linking your information together.
Wikis are not a new concept, in fact there are many web based wiki servers
available.
