**Publisher's Description**  
  

StickIt is a Windows desktop sticky note application. Create notes and place
them anywhere on your desktop. The notes will stay where you leave them until
they have been closed. The notes will even reappear after rebooting your
computer. You can customize your notes by choosing from a wide range of text
and background colors.

If youA're on the same network as other StickIt users, you can create notes on
their desktops. You can send notes across other networks as well, but that
requires that both StickIt users have properly opened port 1979 for UDP
access.

**What's New in version 3.0.6:**

  * ADDED: CTRL+Enter can now be pressed at the StickIt Note Editor window to create/send a note. 
  * FIXED: "&" now properly displayed when used in note text. 
  * FIXED: StickIt tray icon was not reloading after Windows Explorer crashed.
