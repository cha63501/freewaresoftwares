HandyNotes is a small software program that makes it easy to keep all your
notes organized in one easily accessible place.

With HandyNotes, any time you need to jot something down you can just click on
an icon and create a new note. If you need to refer to previous notes, you can
easily browse them, or search for a keyword.

Starting with version 2.0, HandyNotes users can now synchronize their notes
with the HandyNotes.net website, meaning that you can access your notes from
any computer with web access, at any time! Or if, for example, you run
HandyNotes at home and at work, you can keep all your notes synchronized and
easily accessible.
