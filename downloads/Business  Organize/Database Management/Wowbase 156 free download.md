**Publisher's Description**  
  

Create your own database quickly and easily. The main feature of the program -
records are not in the form of rows, and in the form of cards. This method of
editing the records you have not tried! There is quite a different attitude to
the records: now this is not one thin strip of thousands, and a separate
independent object that can be manipulated. You can even copy a few records
and send them via instant message or e-mail to a colleague that he added them
to his table. Very simple interface and minimal facilities needed for editing
tables.

The main program window displays the contents of an open table (one file - one
table). Here you can add, edit and delete records. But you first need to
specify the structure of the table: to define a list of its fields.
