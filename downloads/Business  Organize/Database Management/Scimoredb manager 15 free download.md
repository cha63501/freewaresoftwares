**Publisher's Description**  
  

ScimoreDB manager is an application that allows you browse your databases.

Administrator privileges on windows are required for installing or
uninstalling database servers, as servers are installed as Windows system
Services.

The Database Manager can only be used to install servers on the local machine,
so you are required to run the Database Manager on each of the machine you
wish to install a server on.
