**Publisher's Description**  
  


SQL SPY was designed as a tool to display, monitor and report on valuable SQL Server information. 

Look around the internet and find any SQL Server monitoring tool. Now compare them to SQL SPY. What you will find is that you are going to pay hundreds, if not thousands of dollars for them. Since 1999 I have dedicated all my free time to developing an alternative to those high priced applications. Will those companies promise you a 24 hour turn-around time for bug fixes? Will those companies actually listen to you and add the features or functionality that you really want? SQL SPY supports 75 distinct features, and every one of those features has come from you! I have been a working SQL Server DBA since version 4x and a VB developer for 10 years. My competition hires developers that only look at their product from the other side of the fence.

SQL SPYA's reporting capabilities include the Server, Database, and Connection levels. Generate data object biographies that include dependencies, sizes, indexes, rules, triggers and defaults, stored procedures, user functions and views. Monitor and record user connections over long periods of time with minimal impact even within the most sensitive production environment. 

**Important!**

  1. If you are upgrading or reinstalling SQL SPY, you will need to use the "Clean" button on the SQL registration window and re-register any SQL 2005 instances to be able to use the new features. 
  2. SQL SPY is going Open Source! I do not have the time to continue SQL SPY like I want to. So, IA'm turning lose the code under the Open Source License. 

**Minimum requirements:**

  * Microsoft SQL Server client Network utilities and Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager. (You must have the ability to connect to a SQL Server to begin with.) 
  * [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html)
