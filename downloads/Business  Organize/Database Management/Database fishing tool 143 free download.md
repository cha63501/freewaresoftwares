Database Fishing Tool (DaFT) is a front-end to any database that can be
connected to with an ODBC driver. DaFT allows you to browse the database
objects, view data in tables and views, and create and execute SQL statements,
also as a script, including variable scanning.

DaFT contains a database objects list (tables and views), list of columns and
column properties, a table for data snapshots, detailed data view, a notepad,
a table for viewing the outcome of select statements, T-SQL or PL/SQL
statements, a SQL statement editor with syntax highlighting, and a screen to
follow all ODBC driver messages (errors etc.).

All selected data can be saved into a file. The supported file formats are
HTML, XLS, CSV, SyLK, and DIF. The SQL statements can be saved into a text
file.
