**Publisher's Description**  
  


Jumper is a new kind of knowledgebase built on Web 2.0 technology. 

Our software provides an Intranet portal where user-created data profiles identify quality data resources, user-contributed information adds real-world knowledge about the data resources, and user-created reviews sort out the worthy resources from the inadequate. Other users can search the knowledgebase for this data. 

In addition, they can directly contribute what they know about this data to the knowledgebase. It allows the participants to act as a filter for what is valuable and build upon mainstream pursuits, but also uncovers valuable data hidden in silos.

**System Requirements:**

  * Operating System: Linux, Unix, Windows, Mac 
  * Web Server: Apache Web Server / IIS5 or above 
  * Database: MySQL 4.1 or above 
  * Scripting Language: PHP 4.3.0 - 5.2
