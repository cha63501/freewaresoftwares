**Publisher's Description**  
  


Melange (French for mixture) is a technical commercial computer application that keeps track of actual prices (per kilogram) of mixtures calculated from a table (materials) containing prices of ingredients and another table (recipes) containing mixtures (ingredients and their masses [kg] in the recipe). 

This program is meant for businesses that have to manage dozens of recipes containing ingredients which costs may vary considerably depending on oil-prices or season. This holds especially true in situations where ingredients or components are present in more than one mixture in varying amounts. Thus, this program is a valuable tool to see how fluctuating prices of starting materials propagate in products derived from them.

Businesses include cosmetics, industrial emulsions, paints, detergents, food stuffs, waxes, oils, etc. An up-to-date price-list of products (without production, packaging and labeling costs) is of utmost importance.
