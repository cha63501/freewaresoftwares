**Publisher's Description**  
  

Melange (French for mixture) is a technical commercial computer application
that keeps track of actual prices (per kilogram) of mixtures calculated from a
table (materials) containing prices of ingredients and another table (recipes)
containing mixtures (ingredients and their masses [kg] in the recipe).

This program is meant for businesses that have to manage dozens of recipes
containing ingredients which costs may vary considerably depending on oil-
prices or season. This holds especially true in situations where ingredients
or components are present in more than one mixture in varying amounts. Thus,
this program is a valuable tool to see how fluctuating prices of starting
materials propagate in products derived from them.

Businesses include cosmetics, industrial emulsions, paints, detergents, food
stuffs, waxes, oils, etc. An up-to-date price-list of products (without
production, packaging and labeling costs) is of utmost importance.
