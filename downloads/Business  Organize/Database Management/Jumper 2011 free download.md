**Publisher's Description**  
  

Jumper is a new kind of knowledgebase built on Web 2.0 technology.

Our software provides an Intranet portal where user-created data profiles
identify quality data resources, user-contributed information adds real-world
knowledge about the data resources, and user-created reviews sort out the
worthy resources from the inadequate. Other users can search the knowledgebase
for this data.

In addition, they can directly contribute what they know about this data to
the knowledgebase. It allows the participants to act as a filter for what is
valuable and build upon mainstream pursuits, but also uncovers valuable data
hidden in silos.

**System Requirements:**

  * Operating System: Linux, Unix, Windows, Mac 
  * Web Server: Apache Web Server / IIS5 or above 
  * Database: MySQL 4.1 or above 
  * Scripting Language: PHP 4.3.0 - 5.2 
  * Script Cache Software: Ioncube Loader
