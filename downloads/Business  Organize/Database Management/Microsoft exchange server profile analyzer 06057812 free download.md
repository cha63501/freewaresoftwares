Use the Microsoft Exchange Server Profile Analyzer tool to collect estimated
statistical information from a single mailbox store or across an Exchange
Server organization. The collected data can be used for such tasks as
analyzing the performance and health of a server that has mailboxes, improving
capacity planning models, and improving testing methodologies and tools.

Prior to upgrading to this version, users should backup the default Profile
Analyzer configuration XML file if any customizations have been made.

Important Notice: The Microsoft Exchange Profile Analyzer tool collects
information related to user activity on production mailbox systems and can be
used to generate aggregate user profile statistics for sets of Exchange users.
Before using the tool in a production environment, you may wish to ensure that
your collection and use of this information is consistent with the privacy and
other laws of your country.
