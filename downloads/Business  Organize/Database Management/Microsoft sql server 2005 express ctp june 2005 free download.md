**Publisher's Description**  
  

SQL Server Express is a version of SQL Server 2005 designed for building
simple, dynamic applications. It helps developers build robust and reliable
applications by providing a powerful database that is also free and easy to
use. Too often database systems are overly complex for building simple
applications. This and the other Express products reduce this complexity by
providing a simple but powerful development environment for building data-
driven applications. You can design schemas, add data, and query local
databases, all inside the Visual Studio 2005 environment. If you need more
advanced database features, then SQL Server Express can be seamlessly upgraded
to more sophisticated versions of SQL Server.
