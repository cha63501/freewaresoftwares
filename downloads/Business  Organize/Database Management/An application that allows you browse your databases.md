ScimoreDB manager is an application that allows you browse your databases. 

Administrator privileges on windows are required for installing or uninstalling database servers, as servers are installed as Windows system Services.

The Database Manager can only be used to install servers on the local machine, so you are required to run the Database Manager on each of the machine you wish to install a server on.
