**Publisher's Description**  
  

Personal Finance Manager for Windows is a Free program developed to help you
manage your finances by enabling you to record transaction and budget
information within accounts.

You use PFM to record income and expenditure so that you can reconcile each
account against a statement. As you record each transaction PFM calculates a
balance and with the aid of a checking check box you can indicate if a
transaction has been reconciled.

You can also register payments that can be automatically debited or credited
on given dates. You also have the option to create budgets which allows you to
register each transactions value to one or more of these. The facility to copy
or move selected transactions between accounts helps you to reduce repetitive
entries.

Reporting facilities allow you to display graphs, pie charts, balance plots
and multiple page colour reports that can be displayed, printed and exported
into many popular formats.

Some of the other features include the ability to UN-delete deleted
transactions, create multiple accounts, move copy transactions between
accounts, manual column width adjustment and multiple budget transaction
allocations. Fully encrypted database with password protection.
