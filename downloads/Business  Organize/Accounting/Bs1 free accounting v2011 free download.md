Free Accounting Software: General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts
Receivable, Inventory, Sales Analysis, and Bank Reconciliation. Upgradeable to
BS1 Professional for Time Billing or BS1 Enterprise for Sales Orders, Purchase
Orders, and Manufacturing.

Multi-currency features facilitate purchasing and selling internationally
(import and export). The default selling price is automatically converted to
the customerA's currency. Payables and receivables are tracked separately for
each currency and the GL automatically converts revenues and expenses to
domestic currency. Gain or loss due to exchange rate fluctuations is tracked.

User-defined financial statements can be created through a simple set-up
process. GL account totals and inventory totals can be viewed on screen with
drill-down to original source transactions.

Sample data is provided and there is an optional Getting Started wizard to
assist with entering initial live data. The wizard sets up common GL accounts
which can later be changed, deleted, or added to.

Customization and Delphi source code available for several databases.

Free for a single user.
