**Publisher's Description**  
  

Noah is the first application to free your information from the separate "data
islands" of your browser, email client, contact manager, file folders,
schedule and RSS feeds. Noah bridges these currently divided data sources and
makes it all accessible from a single interface. And your data is always
available, online or offline.

Emails, website bookmarks, desktop files, contacts, itA's all in there
somewhere. But how do you dig through the thousands of ad-mails and spam-mails
to find that really important one from your client, or your boss. Remember
that Word document you prepared for him? Where did you put it? In Noah you
never have to spend hours searching for this stuff again, itA's all in one
place arranged by date and time. If you can roughly remember when something
happened, you can find it with a few clicks, and you will find everything else
that was happening during the same day, hour, or minute. Because Noah arranges
all of your information automatically, exactly the way you want it.

Import email settings, emails and contacts from Outlook and Thunderbird plus
thereA's automatic setup for Gmail, Lycos, Yahoo, Netscape, Mail.com, and
Tiscali email accounts.

Setting up Noah is a breeze with the setup wizard. Importing or setting up an
account can be completed with a few clicks, and thereA's no limit to the
number of accounts that you can setup at the same time. Want to keep thousands
of emails from all of your email accounts neatly arranged in Noah? No problem,
thatA's what it was designed for, and with itA's powerful database and fast
interface even very large numbers of emails can be organized and accessed in a
flash.

Even though Noah contains more advanced data management features then any
similar application, it doesnA't require a computer science degree to use it.
Noah has a simple, intuitive, interface with easy to find commands - drag,
drop, done!
