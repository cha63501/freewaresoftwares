**Publisher's Description**  
  

Knobjex (short for Knowledge Objects) is an information-manager that uses a
networked approach to store information. Any item (or A'knowlegde-objectA')
can have multiple parents and multiple children. Although meant to be a
knowledge-database, it can hold any type of data.

Particularly, it has been adapted as a PIM-tool for task-management, a
calendar, and procedure-management. As opposed to Outlook for example, where
tasks and appointments are different things (disappointing i would say),
everything is stored in the single table.
