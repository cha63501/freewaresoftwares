**Publisher's Description**  
  

FreeText is a simple and easy-to-use notebook for making notes, keeping to-do
lists, storing information on accounts and contacts, etc. It can be helpful
when you need to save a link, interesting citation, phone number or to simply
insert text from a clipboard for a short time.

By clicking on a program icon you can immediately start entering data. You
donA't have to create and save files - the file is always open in the program,
and all changes are automatically saved. No worries!

The program is initially customized to launch when your computer turns on and
to be always shown in the notification area. You enter data with the help of
multi-editor - a technology that adds easy-to-use and helpful functions to a
text editor. For example, the text may include different elements.

**WhatA's new in version 1.38:**

  * Two errors were fixed. 
  * Backup file name option added.
