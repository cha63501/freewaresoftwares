**Publisher's Description**  
  


Task Coach is a simple open source todo manager to manage personal tasks and todo lists. It grew out of my frustration that well-known task managers, such as those provided with Outlook or Lotus Notes, do not provide facilities for composite tasks. Often, tasks and other things todo consist of several activities. Task Coach is designed to deal with composite tasks. 

**Features:**

  * Creating, editing, and deleting tasks and subtasks. 
  * Tasks have a subject, description, priority, start date, due date and a completion date. 
  * Tasks can be viewed as a list or as a tree. 
  * Tasks can be sorted by all task attributes, e.g. subject, budget, budget left, due date, etc. 
  * Several filters to e.g. hide completed tasks or view only tasks that are due today. 
  * Task status depends on its subtask and vice versa. E.g. if you mark the last uncompleted subtask as completed, the parent task is automatically marked as completed too. 
  * Tasks can be assigned to user-defined categories. 
  * Settings are persistent and saved automatically. The last opened file is loaded automatically when starting Task Coach. 
  * Track time spent on tasks. Tasks can have a budget. Time spent can be viewed by individual effort period, by day, by week, and by month. 
  * The Task Coach file format (.tsk) is XML.
