**Publisher's Description**  
  

PIM Xtreme is a free Open Source application of management of personal
information (PIM: Personal Information Manager) configurable and highly
flexible (or at least that is the goal). It aims to be a powerful organizer
for your personal data.

All this information is stored in a relational database (MySQL for the moment)
to be able to be accessed and consulted in a flexible way. It also allows
exporting most of its data to some standard formats (like CVS, XML, etc.).

It counts with different aspects or modules in addition to the own
functionalities of the system. Such they are, by now:

**Agenda:**

  * Contacts 
  * Notes / annotationes (with encryption) 
  * Tasks / to-do 
  * Events 
  * Calendar 

**Finance:**

  * Accounts 
  * Movements (mean financial movements) 
And finally, you can link information from one module to another. For example,
you can relate a Contact to an Account, or an Event to a Task.

**Software Requirements:**

  * [Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html) or above 
  * Microsoft .Net ReporViewer (included on PIM Xtreme installer) 
  * MySQL ODBC/Connector (included on PIM Xtreme installer) 
Also you need a Server machine (could be the same as Client) in which you
should have the [MySQL Server 5.x](http://www.freewarefiles.com/MySQL-For-
Windows_program_13992.html) running.

**WhatA's New in version 0.10.0:**

  * New: Currencies feature! (multi-currency support) 
  * Fix: Remove an account for an existing movement. 
  * Fix: Translation fix in Movement Annual Group report. 
  * Fix: Error trying to import contacts. 
  * Fix: Refresh rows data in grid on 'Refresh' action
