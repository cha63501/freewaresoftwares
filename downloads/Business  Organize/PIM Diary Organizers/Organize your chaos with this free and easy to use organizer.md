**Publisher's Description**  
  


As a computer is supposed to be a helpful tool I always wanted to organize some of my mess on the computer. I couldnA't really find an organizer that I liked, the ones I tried was either too confusing with too many buttons/options or had an annoying layout, etc. So I decided to make my own little simple and compact organizer which features an appointment/to-do manager (appointments will pop-up), a calendar, contacts (phone/address-book), a notebook which supports multiple topics, sync via internet, email forwarding of appointments, print/import/export and much more. All is password protected and encrypted (optional). You can also customize your own skin and background for the application so it wonA't be too dull to look at (ships with a number of skins).
