myDiary 4.5 is a major upgrade from the previous versions of myDiary. This
version is the first to use a database to keep all your personal data secured
and organized. The user interface is neat, simple and intuitive - unlike most
diary applications that have icons and buttons clustered all over their
interface. Futhermore, the software is portable, meaning you can install it to
a USB device and simply run it from there. If you need a simple diary that
will simply allow you to write down whatA's on your mind, then youA've found
it. This version is still in a beta state so please report any bugs you might
encounter.
