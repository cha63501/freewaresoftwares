**Publisher's Description**  
  


This program reminds you about future (and past) birthdays and (wedding) anniversaries. Information is taken directly from your Address Book (list of Contacts), this allows you to avoid duplicating the same information in several places. These Address Books are supported: Address Book of MS Outlook Express, Contacts of MS Outlook, and any other address book, that may be presented in XML format. 

You can edit the list of contacts (i.e. friends) and their anniversaries in your "Address Book Application" (Outlook Express, etc.) or directly in yvReminder.

With one click in yvReminder, you can:

  * send new message (E-Mail) to selected contact using your Mail Program; 
  * go to a contactA's Personal or Business Web Page in the Internet; 
  * dial any personal, mobile or business phone number by your Telephony services (TAPI); 
  * export the whole table of events to the HTML file. So you may copy or print the list. 
yvReminder doesnA't substitute any of these programs - instead, it cooperates with them, making routine operations for you.
