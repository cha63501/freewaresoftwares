**Publisher's Description**  
  

In My Diary is a smart, free personal organizer.

The main display is based on a traditional diary format but, although all
entries appear as one line of text, each actual entry can contain as many
lines as required. Diary entries can be set to auto-repeat at the required
interval.

In addition to the daily diary, there is also a daily journal facility, a
calendar, Password Manager (and generator), Address book with flexible
labelling system, Anniversary entries and a notes section with links to diary
entries.

It runs on Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7, and on Apple Mac (10.4 and above).
There is also now a native version for Linux OS or the Windows version can be
used and works well running in the Wine emulator.

Downloads for MacOS X and Linux are available at the [developerA's
website](http://www.inmydiary.co.uk/download.php).
