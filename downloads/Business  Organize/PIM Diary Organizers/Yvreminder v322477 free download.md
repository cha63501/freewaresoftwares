**Publisher's Description**  
  

This program reminds you about future (and past) birthdays and (wedding)
anniversaries. Information is taken directly from your Address Book (list of
Contacts), this allows you to avoid duplicating the same information in
several places. These Address Books are supported: Address Book of MS Outlook
Express, Contacts of MS Outlook, and any other address book, that may be
presented in XML format.

You can edit the list of contacts (i.e. friends) and their anniversaries in
your "Address Book Application" (Outlook Express, etc.) or directly in
yvReminder.

With one click in yvReminder, you can:

  * send new message (E-Mail) to selected contact using your Mail Program; 
  * go to a contactA's Personal or Business Web Page in the Internet; 
  * dial any personal, mobile or business phone number by your Telephony services (TAPI); 
  * export the whole table of events to the HTML file. So you may copy or print the list. 
yvReminder doesnA't substitute any of these programs - instead, it cooperates
with them, making routine operations for you.
