**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Collegiate Daily Planner combines unique project management technologies with daily planner technologies to show you a complete planning system, unlike any other application on the market! Best of all, the Collegiate Daily Planner is yours to use free of charge! Through a special partnership with our corporate sponsors, this software is currently available at no cost to our users. 

The Collegiate Daily Planner contains three modules: the Calendar of Events, the Project Manager and the Bulletin Board. The Calendar of Events and the Project Manager let you create and update the various pieces of information that represent a "daily plan". While you probably wonA't need more than one daily plan, you may create as many as you wish. Each plan is stored in a separate file, in the directory of your choice. The Bulletin Board lets you create, open and save these files.
