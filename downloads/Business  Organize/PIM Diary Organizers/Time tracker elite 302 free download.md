**Publisher's Description**  
  

It is now possible for all organizations to track time and activities. Time
Tracker can share a common database repository to enable reporting across the
organization. Individuals and organizations will benefit by standardizing on
how activities are reported. Use standard activities and defined projects to
generate reports and determine metrics on how time is being allocated. Time
Tracker meets quality assurance requirements to time on process engineering.

People who track their time are more productive and more satisfied with daily
production. Time tracking both reduces waste and demonstrates how time was
effectively used. Use time tracking to enforce limits on Atime slicingA
(frequent switching between tasks) and as a tool to maintain focus on the
currently selected activity. Use the reporting capability to review how time
has been allocated to evaluate how effective the time was utilized and how
productive the allocation was. Use the gathered information to better predict
how long similar activities can be expected to take and better manage your
time.

A wizard gets you started by defining your projects and common activities
within and across projects. This list can be added and modified as you learn
more about how you utilize your time and how you want to record how time is
utilized. The application resides on the Windows tray and is activated on your
command. You can automatically track time or manually enter tasks. A task tree
is used to maintain commonality across all projects and all users. Multiple
options are available for reporting how time has been utilized, by day, by
project, by activity and by user. Time Tracker can be integrated with Great
Budget CRIMS to track time on task for cost/risk management and can also be
integrated with Great Budget Alarm Clock.
