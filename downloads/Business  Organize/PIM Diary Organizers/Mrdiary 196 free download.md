MrDiary is a single window journal software that makes it easy, at a glance,
to manage weekly notes. It contains calendar with markings on days containing
notes (on center of window), user contacts (on the right). Set localization in
english, italian or french language.

MrDiary saves your notes into a folder named "diary database". If you want,
you can edit these files or copy this folder to transfer your user data from
