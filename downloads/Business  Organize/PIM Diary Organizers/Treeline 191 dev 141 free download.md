**Publisher's Description**  
  

TreeLine is a PIM that stores almost any kind of information. A tree structure
makes it easy to keep things organized. And each node in the tree can contain
several fields, forming a mini-database. The output format for each node can
be defined, and the output can be shown on the screen, printed, or exported to
html.

**Features:**

  * Stores almost any type of information, including plain text, HTML, numbers, dates, times, booleans, URLs, etc. 
  * The tree structure helps keep things organized. 
  * Each node can have several fields that form a mini-database.
