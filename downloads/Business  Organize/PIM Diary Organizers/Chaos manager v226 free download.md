**Publisher's Description**  
  

As a computer is supposed to be a helpful tool I always wanted to organize
some of my mess on the computer. I couldnA't really find an organizer that I
liked, the ones I tried was either too confusing with too many buttons/options
or had an annoying layout, etc. So I decided to make my own little simple and
compact organizer which features an appointment/to-do manager (appointments
will pop-up), a calendar, contacts (phone/address-book), a notebook which
supports multiple topics, sync via internet, email forwarding of appointments,
print/import/export and much more. All is password protected and encrypted
(optional). You can also customize your own skin and background for the
application so it wonA't be too dull to look at (ships with a number of
skins).
