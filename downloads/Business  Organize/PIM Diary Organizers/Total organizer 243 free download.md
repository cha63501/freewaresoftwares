**Publisher's Description**  
  

Total Organizer is a Personal Information Manager (PIM) that helps you
organize and plan your business and personal life.

What's unique about the app, is that it allows you to store all of your
contacts, tasks (calendar), notes, and to-do lists divided into tree-
structured categories. In addition, each item (be it a note, task, contact
,etc) may belong to several categories (tags).

So, this is a combination of folders (tree) and tags. Note, that if you create
subfolders (subcategories) - then by opening a folder you can see all the
items belonging to it, and the contents of all its subfolders. So, by opening
root folder (at the top), you can see all items of given type (e.g. notes, if
you're in "notes" tab).
