**Publisher's Description**  
  


Piggydb is a Web notebook application that provides you with a platform to build your knowledge personally or collaboratively. 

With Piggydb, you can create highly structural knowledge by connecting knowledge fragments to each other to build a network structure, which is more flexible and expressive than a tree structure. Fragments can also be classified with hierarchical tags.

Piggydb does not aim to be an input-and-search database application. It aims to be a platform that encourages you to organize your knowledge continuously to discover new ideas or concepts, and moreover enrich your creativity. 

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
