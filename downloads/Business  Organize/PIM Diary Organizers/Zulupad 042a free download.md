**Publisher's Description**  
  

ZuluPad is a notepad on crack. ItA's a place to jot down class notes,
appointments, to-do lists, favorite websites, pretty much anything you can
think of. The great thing about ZuluPad is that it combines the best parts of
a notepad with the best parts of a wiki, a concept made popular by Wikipedia.

Say for instance, youA're a music major, and youA're studying Bach. YouA've
taken notes on Bach in ZuluPad, and after a long 16 weeks have finally
completed the semester. Sometime after the summer break, youA're taking notes
on Beethoven, and your teacher mentions a way in which Beethoven was
influenced by Bach. As soon as you type "Bach" into your notes, itA's
underlined as a hyperlink. You think to yourself, "oh yeah, I know a few
things about Bach". So you click the link, and you can read all of your Bach
notes. While youA're reading your Bach notes, you happen to notice a link to a
page about Henry Purcell, and you can refresh your memory about him, too.
