**Publisher's Description**  
  

Piggydb is a Web notebook application that provides you with a platform to
build your knowledge personally or collaboratively.

With Piggydb, you can create highly structural knowledge by connecting
knowledge fragments to each other to build a network structure, which is more
flexible and expressive than a tree structure. Fragments can also be
classified with hierarchical tags.

Piggydb does not aim to be an input-and-search database application. It aims
to be a platform that encourages you to organize your knowledge continuously
to discover new ideas or concepts, and moreover enrich your creativity.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
