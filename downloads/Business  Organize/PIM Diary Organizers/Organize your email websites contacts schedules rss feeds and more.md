**Publisher's Description**  
  


Noah is the first application to free your information from the separate "data islands" of your browser, email client, contact manager, file folders, schedule and RSS feeds. Noah bridges these currently divided data sources and makes it all accessible from a single interface. And your data is always available, online or offline. 

Emails, website bookmarks, desktop files, contacts, itA's all in there somewhere. But how do you dig through the thousands of ad-mails and spam-mails to find that really important one from your client, or your boss. Remember that Word document you prepared for him? Where did you put it? In Noah you never have to spend hours searching for this stuff again, itA's all in one place arranged by date and time. If you can roughly remember when something happened, you can find it with a few clicks, and you will find everything else that was happening during the same day, hour, or minute. Because Noah arranges all of your information automatically, exactly the way you want it. 

Import email settings, emails and contacts from Outlook and Thunderbird plus thereA's automatic setup for Gmail, Lycos, Yahoo, Netscape, Mail.com, and Tiscali email accounts.

Setting up Noah is a breeze with the setup wizard. Importing or setting up an account can be completed with a few clicks, and thereA's no limit to the number of accounts that you can setup at the same time. Want to keep thousands of emails from all of your email accounts neatly arranged in Noah? No problem, thatA's what it was designed for, and with itA's powerful database and fast interface even very large numbers of emails can be organized and accessed in a flash.

Even though Noah contains more advanced data management features then any similar application, it doesnA't require a computer science degree to use it. Noah has a simple, intuitive, interface with easy to find commands - drag, drop, done!
