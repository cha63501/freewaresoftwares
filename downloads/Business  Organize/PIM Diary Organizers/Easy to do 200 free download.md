**Publisher's Description**  
  

Xanadu Tools specializes in productivity-enhancing tools for Windows.

Our first product is Easy To-Do, a FREE utility which helps you manage your
To-Do lists. It is a simple but powerful program to help you remember all
those important little tasks you have to do, at home or in the office. It was
originally developed for our own use. After using it extensively for a time in
our daily work, we decided to release it to the public.

With Easy To-Do you can become more efficient and get more things done in less
time. Easy To-Do can also function as project-management software, letting you
assign tasks to a resource, e.g. a project or a person responsible for the
task.
