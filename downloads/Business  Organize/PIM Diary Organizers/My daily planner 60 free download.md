**Publisher's Description**  
  

My Daily Planner is a useful program that keeps track of any type of task that
needs to be completed. These tasks can include school work or just a simple
to-do-list. It even color-codes the task by the importance that you give it.
The more important it is the brighter the color, thus making it stand out in
the list.

It was originally developed as a simple program for keeping track of school
work that needed to be completed. The program design is made to be compact and
easy to use. There can be up to 12 tasks at a time in the list with
information including the task description, due date, subject, and importance.
The whole task line will be color coded depending upon the taskA's importance.
Also included are sections for other notes, and appointments.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
