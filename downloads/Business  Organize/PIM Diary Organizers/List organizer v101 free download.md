**Publisher's Description**  
  

List organizer is a program that helps you keep track of lists. The master
list feature allows you to keep track of all items that might go in a
particular type of list. Items within the list and master list can be moved up
or down and deleted as necessary. Lists and master lists can be saved. Lists
can be printed.

**System Requirements:**

  * Operating System: Windows 95/98/Me/NT 4.0/2000/XP/Vista 
  * Processor: IA'm not sure of the minimum. The program works on a Pentium 166 Mhz and it may work on slower processors. 
  * Ram: Again, IA'm not sure of the minimum. It works on a system with 48 megabytes and it may work on a system with less than that. 
  * Hard drive space: Approximately 400 kilobytes + space for saved list and master list files (really shouldnA't be an issue on most computers that can run the program) 
  * Screen resolution: 800x600 or higher 
To view the help file, you need HTML Help, which comes with Internet Explorer
4.0 and higher. Of the versions of Windows listed above, Windows 95 is
probably the only one where you might not have IE 4 or higher installed. If
you click on the help menu item "Using List Organizer" and nothing happens,
you may need to manually open the help file (listorg.chm) by double-clicking
it in Windows Explorer or by making a shortcut to it on the desktop and
double-clicking the shortcut.
