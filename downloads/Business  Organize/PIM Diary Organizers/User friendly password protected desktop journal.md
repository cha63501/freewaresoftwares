**Publisher's Description**  
  


Desktop Journal_1.5 is basic and straightforward journal software, meant to store your entries safely, without all the confusing and frivolous bells and whistles. All entries are encrypted and access to the interior of your journal can only be accessed by you (front-cover passcode). Entries can be searched by date, you can simply flip through your entries by page (forward and back), or you can set the trackbar thumb to jump to a desired location within your journal pages. 

The interior of the journal also contains a user friendly, searchable and integrated contact book which can store names, numbers and email or street addresses of family or friends. Complete help-files are also included. 

There are no special system requirements. Windows platform (compatibility): XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8/8RT (RT is the A'lightA' version installed on most small tablets). 

**WhatA's New in version 2.1:**

  * Improved Daily reminder function (mutiple entries, set date, alerts) 
  * Added: Year_End Archive (Journal restart for New Year) 
  * Fixed: Journal Game #1 bug (size ( array error)) 
  * Improved support for Windows 8 (code changes) 
  * Updated help files accordingly
