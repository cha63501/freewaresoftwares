**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Collegiate Daily Planner combines unique project management technologies
with daily planner technologies to show you a complete planning system, unlike
any other application on the market! Best of all, the Collegiate Daily Planner
is yours to use free of charge! Through a special partnership with our
corporate sponsors, this software is currently available at no cost to our
users.

The Collegiate Daily Planner contains three modules: the Calendar of Events,
the Project Manager and the Bulletin Board. The Calendar of Events and the
Project Manager let you create and update the various pieces of information
that represent a "daily plan". While you probably wonA't need more than one
daily plan, you may create as many as you wish. Each plan is stored in a
separate file, in the directory of your choice. The Bulletin Board lets you
create, open and save these files.
