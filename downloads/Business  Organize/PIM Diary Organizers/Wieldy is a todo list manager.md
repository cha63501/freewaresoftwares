**Publisher's Description**  
  


Wieldy is a free to-do list manager that is based on the principles of GTD (Getting Things Done). 

It allows you to manage your to-dos in a simple but effective way. To-dos can be created as thoughts and actions, which can then be assigned to the Next Action, Today, or Someday categories. Tasks can also be scheduled and listed in a calender-like overview, as well as linked to a project or simply put on hold. 

Wieldy also allows you to manage your contacts and delegate actions to them. Other features include support for data encryption, tagging, priorities, recurring action templates and synchronization with other PIMs like Outlook. No installation is needed.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3_program_31320.html).
