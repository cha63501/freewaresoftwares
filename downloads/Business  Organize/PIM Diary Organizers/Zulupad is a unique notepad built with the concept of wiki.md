**Publisher's Description**  
  


ZuluPad is a notepad on crack. ItA's a place to jot down class notes, appointments, to-do lists, favorite websites, pretty much anything you can think of. The great thing about ZuluPad is that it combines the best parts of a notepad with the best parts of a wiki, a concept made popular by Wikipedia. 

Say for instance, youA're a music major, and youA're studying Bach. YouA've taken notes on Bach in ZuluPad, and after a long 16 weeks have finally completed the semester. Sometime after the summer break, youA're taking notes on Beethoven, and your teacher mentions a way in which Beethoven was influenced by Bach. As soon as you type "Bach" into your notes, itA's underlined as a hyperlink. You think to yourself, "oh yeah, I know a few things about Bach". So you click the link, and you can read all of your Bach notes. While youA're reading your Bach notes, you happen to notice a link to a page about Henry Purcell, and you can refresh your memory about him, too.
