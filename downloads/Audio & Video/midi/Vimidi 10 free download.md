**Publisher's Description**  
  

Vimidi is a standalone windows application that allows you to use your mouse
and keyboard as a MIDI controller. Vimidi translates your actions on regular
input devices to MIDI messages.

Your mouse X and Y coordinates are translated to MIDI messages, so if you move
your mouse on the screen it will act as moving a fader on real MIDI
controller. So basically your screen becomes a XY screen controller. Mouse
tracking is enabled by pressing and holding a hotkey.

You can run a MIDI LFO with your keyboard (again by pressing a hotkey). LFO
rate and waveform are also configurable. If are you required to fire some
complex patterns, you can record it to a midi file and press a hotkey for MIDI
file playback. So you can record a bunch of actions and play them back with a
single press of a key. As soon as key is released MIDI file playback stops.
