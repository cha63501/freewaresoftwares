**Publisher's Description**  
  

Anvil Studio is a program for multi-track recording, composing, and editing of
music using digital audio, MIDI, and sampled percussion sounds. Audio effects
include delay, pitch change, volume change, filtering, and reverse. Anvil
Studio is designed for people who want to perform music with MIDI equipment,
or record and edit music with MIDI and audio equipment or with a computer and
sound card.

This free version allows you to record and edit a single stereo or mono one-
minute audio track, and create unlimited MIDI tracks. Optional accessories
allow you to record and mix up to eight stereo/mono audio tracks, and more.
Anvil Studio now provides a grid to the staff editor, an on-screen guitar
fretboard or piano input, support for nested loops in rhythm and piano roll
editors, and native EQ.
