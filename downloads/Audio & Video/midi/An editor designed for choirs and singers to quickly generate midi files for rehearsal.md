**Publisher's Description**  
  


Speedy MIDI is an editor designed for choirs and singers to quickly generate MIDI files for rehearsal. ItA's NOT a full scale MIDI editor like there are many others on the market. 

If the quality of the sheet music is too low for scanning, Speedy MIDI is an interesting alternative to other MIDI or notation editors. Use the mouse piano for input, or an external MIDI keyboard.

Notes lengths are entered in multiples of the current cell length. Thus entering dotted notes or ties is not needed any more! Tuplets are fully supported.

Speedy MIDI automatically distributes multiple pressed notes to multiple tracks. This helps when entering music with same rhythmic patterns in multiple voices, e.g. chorale music.

**Features:**

  * unlimited undo/redo 
  * part extraction 
  * rehearsal markers (verse, chorus etc.) 
  * transpose 
  * adjustable playback speed 
  * swing playback 
  * shortcuts for all commands 
  * compatible file format: Standard MIDI File (.mid)
