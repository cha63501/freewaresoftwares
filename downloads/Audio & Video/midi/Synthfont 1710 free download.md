**Publisher's Description**  
  

SynthFont is a program for editing and playing midi files using various sound
source files like SoundFonts, GigaSampler files, SFZ files and more. VST
instruments can also be used instead of a sound source file. The result can be
played back through a sound card or written to wave files. With SynthFont you
can also create audio files (WAV, MP3, OGG, APE, FLAC) from your MIDI files.
SynthFontA's main sound sources are SoundFonts, but also wave files, DLS and
GIGA files - and now also VST Instruments - can be used.

SynthFont supports the use of both VST effects and instruments. SynthFont has
some basic SoundFont editing capabilities and also shows the MIDI data in a
Piano Roll and an Event list. A stand-alone VST instrument version of
SynthFont is also available.
