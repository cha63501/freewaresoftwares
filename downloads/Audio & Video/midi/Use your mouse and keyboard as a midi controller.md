**Publisher's Description**  
  


Vimidi is a standalone windows application that allows you to use your mouse and keyboard as a MIDI controller. Vimidi translates your actions on regular input devices to MIDI messages. 

Your mouse X and Y coordinates are translated to MIDI messages, so if you move your mouse on the screen it will act as moving a fader on real MIDI controller. So basically your screen becomes a XY screen controller. Mouse tracking is enabled by pressing and holding a hotkey.

You can run a MIDI LFO with your keyboard (again by pressing a hotkey). LFO rate and waveform are also configurable. If are you required to fire some complex patterns, you can record it to a midi file and press a hotkey for MIDI file playback. So you can record a bunch of actions and play them back with a single press of a key. As soon as key is released MIDI file playback stops.
