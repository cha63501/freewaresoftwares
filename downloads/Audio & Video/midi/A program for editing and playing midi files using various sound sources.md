**Publisher's Description**  
  


SynthFont is a program for editing and playing midi files using various sound source files like SoundFonts, GigaSampler files, SFZ files and more. VST instruments can also be used instead of a sound source file. The result can be played back through a sound card or written to wave files. With SynthFont you can also create audio files (WAV, MP3, OGG, APE, FLAC) from your MIDI files. SynthFontA's main sound sources are SoundFonts, but also wave files, DLS and GIGA files - and now also VST Instruments - can be used. 

SynthFont supports the use of both VST effects and instruments. SynthFont has some basic SoundFont editing capabilities and also shows the MIDI data in a Piano Roll and an Event list. A stand-alone VST instrument version of SynthFont is also available.
