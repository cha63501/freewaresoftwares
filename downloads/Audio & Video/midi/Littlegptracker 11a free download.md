**Publisher's Description**  
  

LittleGPTracker (a.k.a A'The piggyA') is a music tracker optimized to run on
portable game consoles. It is currently running on Game ParkA's GP2x but
thereA's a version for Windows and Mac as well.

It implements the user interface of littlesounddj, a very famous tracker for
the Gameboy platform that has been tried and tested by many users over the
years, leading to a little complex but yet extremely efficent way of working.

Piggy currently supports 8 monophonic 16Bit/44.1Khz stereo sample playback
channels. Additionally, the program can drive MIDI instruments (with the gp32
and gp2x a custom MIDI interface is required).
