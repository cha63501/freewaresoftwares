**Publisher's Description**  
  

Speedy MIDI is an editor designed for choirs and singers to quickly generate
MIDI files for rehearsal. ItA's NOT a full scale MIDI editor like there are
many others on the market.

If the quality of the sheet music is too low for scanning, Speedy MIDI is an
interesting alternative to other MIDI or notation editors. Use the mouse piano
for input, or an external MIDI keyboard.

Notes lengths are entered in multiples of the current cell length. Thus
entering dotted notes or ties is not needed any more! Tuplets are fully
supported.

Speedy MIDI automatically distributes multiple pressed notes to multiple
tracks. This helps when entering music with same rhythmic patterns in multiple
voices, e.g. chorale music.

**Features:**

  * unlimited undo/redo 
  * part extraction 
  * rehearsal markers (verse, chorus etc.) 
  * transpose 
  * adjustable playback speed 
  * swing playback 
  * shortcuts for all commands 
  * compatible file format: Standard MIDI File (.mid)
