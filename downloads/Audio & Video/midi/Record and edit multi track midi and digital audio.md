Anvil Studio is a program for multi-track recording, composing, and editing of music using digital audio, MIDI, and sampled percussion sounds.

Anvil Studio is designed for people who want to perform music with MIDI equipment, or record and edit music with MIDI and audio equipment or with a computer and sound card. 

This free version allows you to record and edit a single stereo or mono one-minute audio track, and create unlimited MIDI tracks.
