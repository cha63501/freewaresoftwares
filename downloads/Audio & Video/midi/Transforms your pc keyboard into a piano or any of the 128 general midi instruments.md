**Publisher's Description**  
  


DSW Piano is a small yet powerful program that lets you play music on your computer. The only thing you need is Windows, and a keyboard. DSW Piano transforms your keyboard into a piano, or any of the 128 General MIDI instruments available on any computer with a soundcard! If your computer doesnA't have a soundcard, thatA's not a problem - DSW Piano can play notes on your PCA's internal speaker (on a desktop, this is usually on the motherboard or inside the case), however the sound produced by this is a very basic "chirp" sound with no volume control. 

**Record your music**  
So youA've just played a song with DSW Piano that youA're really proud of, but nobody is around to hear it? Not a problem - You can record it! You can then keep the file on your computer to play later, or send it to another DSW Piano user via e-mail, MSN etc.

**Play with your friends**  
NetPiano is a feature of DSW Piano that allows you to connect with your friends, either over the internet or via a LAN, and play together. There are many things you can do once you are set up - Perform together to form a mini orchestra, teach a friend how to play a song, or simply show off!

**Use a real keyboard**  
MIDI Input allows you to use a real keyboard with DSW Piano, which will allow you to record music, or play via NetPiano. You can also use MIDI "loopback" software such as MIDI Yoke or LoopBe as an input device. This will allow you to play MIDI files in a media player, and see the notes displayed in DSW Piano! If your chosen media player allows you to slow down the playback of MIDI files, you can easily learn how to play your favorite songs!
