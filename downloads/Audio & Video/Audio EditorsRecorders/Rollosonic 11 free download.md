**Publisher's Description**  
  

RolloSONIC is a fully-freeware, fully-modular sound-synthesis environment with
mouse-guided tweaking and real-time module interconnection. Automated control
channel duplexing, a variable-bandwidth control pipe, and multi-device euphony
support various possibilities. Like the great module racks historically used
in making sound effects for science-fiction movies, RolloSONIC lets you add
and connect audio-processing modules together, where the sound is playing the
entire time so that changes to the interconnections and changes to the sliders
are heard immediately -- just like with the real thing.

RolloSONIC takes the idea to the next level by letting you incorporate your
mouse movement into the control channels. Optionally, you can also incorporate
your USB or MIDI (musical) keyboard controller and its knobs and sliders into
the mix of control data.

Making experimentation easier, RolloSONIC is freeware, can (optionally) run
without installation, and it has been designed from scratch, with no third-
party frameworks, making it much more efficient on system resources than most
other audio-generating software.
