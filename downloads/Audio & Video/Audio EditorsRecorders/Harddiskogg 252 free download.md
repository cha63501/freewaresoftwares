**Publisher's Description**  
  

HarddiskOgg takes a wave input stream from any Windows 95/98/2000/XP
compatible sampling device (including microphone input and line in) and
converts it to an Ogg Vorbis/Wave/MonkeyA's Audio/MP3 (optional) stream. This
happens in realtime, so basically it is a harddisk recorder in Ogg Vorbis.

**Features:**

  * Real-time encoding with bitrates from 32kbit/sec. up to 320kbit/sec. 
  * Stereo or mono recording from 8kHz to 48kHz 
  * Automatic numbering of output files 
  * Can be placed in the systray and activated by a single click 
  * Smart on-the-fly normalization for low-volume sources 
  * Uses the high quality, patent free Ogg Vorbis encoding engine. Ogg Vorbis easily outperforms MP3 in sound quality, especially at lower bit rates. 
  * LAME MP3 encoder compatible. However, due to patent issues HarddiskOgg ist not distributed with the LAME encoding DLL. If you want MP3 support, fetch LAME_ENC.DLL from the web, but make sure you have the appropriate rights for doing so. 
  * Command line mode for easy integration or scheduled recordings 
  * No fuss or stupid skinned interface, just works. 
  * HarddiskOgg is FREEWARE!
