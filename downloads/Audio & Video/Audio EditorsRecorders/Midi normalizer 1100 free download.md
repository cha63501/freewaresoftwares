**Publisher's Description**  
  

MidiDesignA's MIDI Normalizer application is a batch editor for midi files. If
you have hundreds of midi files and find it annoying that, when playing the
files, the volume level is very different for every file, MIDI Normalizer
automates the process of leveling the volume, just like that normalizer you
already have for normalizing your MP3 collection.

But thereA's more you can do with the software: compressing velocity values,
playing and creating playlists, change the fileA's mix, etc... And best of
all, the software comes FREE of charge.
