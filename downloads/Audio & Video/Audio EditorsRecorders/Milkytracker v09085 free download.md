**Publisher's Description**  
  

Milkytracker is a free music creation tool that was inspired on Fast Tracker 2
(a popular MS-DOS tracker for the PC). It attempts to recreate the module
replay and user experience of the popular DOS tracker Fasttracker II, with
special playback modes available for improved Amiga ProTracker 2.x/3.x
compatibility.

MilkyTracker is not "another Windows tracker" which should already be obvious
by the plethora of supported desktop and portable platforms. In fact it
started as a project to bring tracking to the Pocket PC. When this milestone
was reached, the next one was creating a truly FT2 compatible tracker for
portable as well as modern desktop platforms.

**Features:**

  * Fasttracker II like, custom graphical user interface with context menus 
  * Very accurate .XM replay compared to Ft2 
  * ProTracker 2.x & 3.x playback modes for playing and editing .MOD files 
  * Supported on multiple platforms including hand-held devices 
  * Alternative edit modes for new users and Ft2 veterans 
  * Imports over 30 different module formats 
  * Internal file browser option 
  * Disk (.WAV) recorder 
  * Module size optimizer 
  * Possibility to edit songs live (during playback) 
  * Powerful sample editor featuring waveform generators 
  * Powerful instrument editor featuring envelope zooming and scaling 
  * Prospective pattern view option 
  * Low latency audio driver support 
  * MIDI In support 
  * Various font sizes for improved visibility of pattern data
