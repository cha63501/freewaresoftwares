**Publisher's Description**  
  


EVPmaker is an experimental software for the generation of acoustic "raw material" for recordings of paranormal voices on tape, also known as "Electronic Voice Phenomena" (EVP). For this purpose, the program divides any recording of speech into short segments and then plays them back continuously in randomly order. 

The resulting "gibberish" still sounds like speech, but canA't be understood anymore, and is therefore suited as background noise for EVP recordings. Of course, the program can also be used to generate special acoustical or musical effects.
