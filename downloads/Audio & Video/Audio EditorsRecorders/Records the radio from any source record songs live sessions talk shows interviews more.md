**Publisher's Description**  
  


Snaptune One records the radio and identifies the songs playing on it. You can pause, rewind, or fast forward live radio or skip straight to any song by name. Simply tell Snaptune which radio stations to record, pick any schedule, and it does the rest. 

Snaptune works with internet radio stations, USB FM tuners or a simple line-in connection to your radio receiver. Pick a station from SnaptuneA's extensive list of local or web radio stations; pick a schedule or let Snaptune record 24/7. Snaptune displays a playlist showing you what-played-when, and after a short A'learning periodA' it highlights and tags the individual songs that are playing on the radio. You can click on any song to listen to it again, learn more about it, or go online to purchase a download or CD containing it. DonA't like what you hear right now, simply click on another song to seek forward and play from there instead.

No other software does what Snaptune does: it finds individual songs, new music, live sessions and interviews, some of which arenA't even available on CD yet. It works great for talk radio too. Snaptune puts you in control so you can listen to the radio on your schedule and in the order you want.
