**Publisher's Description**  
  

RMAA suite is designed for testing quality of analog and digital paths of any
audio devices, be it a sound card, an MP3 player, a consumer CD/DVD player or

signals passed through the tested audio path by means of frequency analysis
algorithms. A more common mark is also provided for those unfamiliar with
measured technical parameters.
