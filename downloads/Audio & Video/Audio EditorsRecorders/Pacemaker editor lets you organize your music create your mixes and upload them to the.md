**Publisher's Description**  
  


In addition to being a state-of-the-art music player as well as a complete music library managing application, Pacemaker Editor is all about creating mixes. 

The Editor is tailor-made for quick and easy desktop mix production. The Editor lets you arrange your music and work on the creative detailing via a smooth and simple interface. This is all drag-and-drop, pull, stretch, bend and move around.

You can easily import your current music library automatically by the click of a button. The Editor will analyze BPM on all tracks and generate a waveform to give you a clear-cut view of your tracks and mixes.

Whether you want to create mixes from scratch with your Editor or continue working on mixes made on your device, the creative tools in the Editor and the Pacemaker device are completely in sync. You can export and transfer rendered mixes to your device. You can also transfer mixes made on your device to your Editor in an open format and continue editing and refining as you like. Via the Editor you can then upload your mixes to our mix community, and let the rest of the world hear your stuff.

**WhatA's new in version 2.0.2.14170:**

  * A bug fix release: solved the problem to reorder the tracks within a mix. This problem unfortunately appeared in the latest release of the Editor.
