**Publisher's Description**  
  

Phone Recorder W7 is an application that allows you to join and record an
ongoing telephone conversation. It runs under either 64-bit or 32-bit Windows
7.

Phone Recorder doesnA't have much of a user interface -- just two buttons:  
"Start recording/Stop recording" and "Exit". When you click on "Start
recording", Phone Recorder will join an ongoing phone conversation on the same
line as that of the modem, and the button label will change to "Stop
recording". The conversation is stored as a .wav file in the same folder as
the Phone Recorder executable (.exe) file.

To run Phone Recorder, you need to have a dial-up modem that has voice
capability installed on your computer. Phone Recorder uses only the voice
feature of the modem -- thereA's no need to "dial-up" anywhere. Be sure to
tell the other party or parties on the line that you are recording the
conversation if it is legally required to do so.

Recommended Modem  
\-----------------  
The Rosewill RNX-56USB modem is the only one I can personally vouch for right
now to use with Phone Recorder. The drivers included in this kit are unpacked
versions of the drivers for Windows 7 that I downloaded from RosewillA's
website. IA've been told that the Zoom 3095 will also work for Phone Recorder,
but as far as I can tell, itA's exactly the same hardware as the Rosewill, and
the Rosewill is about half the price.
