**Publisher's Description**  
  


This kangaroo-themed program allows the user to create their own music and sound effects, effectively from scratch. 

This program differs from the Kangas Sound Editor (already listed on Freewarefiles.com) in the programA's database: whereas Kangas Sound Editor requires MySQL, Kangas Sound Editor QI does not (it uses an internal database instead).

It uses a system of boxes or cells, which are placed by the user onto a timeline using drag-and-drop, and which represent entities such as chords, repetition, and individual sounds or notes.

The programA's database allows the user to create and store harmonics, used for constructing melodic instruments, and anti-harmonics, which are used for constructing percussion instruments.

Users can collaborate with each other, and build on the work of others via an XML import/export facility.

Requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.7 or above. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com).
