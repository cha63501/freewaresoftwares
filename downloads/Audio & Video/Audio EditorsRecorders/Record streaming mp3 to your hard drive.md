**Publisher's Description**  
  


Streamripper is an open source application that lets you record streaming mp3 to your hard drive. 

This version includes a new feature, the ability to rip from external metadata. It can be used for recording streams that do not send artist or title information using metadata, but instead send this information using other means. For example, some streams update the current artist and title using html or xml. Another example is icecast 1.x, which sends metadata through a UDP socket.

Streamripper can get artist and title information from these kinds of streams using a helper application, specified using the -E option. The helper application needs to find the title and artist info, and write it to stdout. Streamripper reads the stdout of the helper program, and uses it to split the tracks accordingly. 

**What's New in version 1.64.6:**

  * Fix bug which creates corrupted id3v2 tags 
  * Remove trailing periods for stream name
