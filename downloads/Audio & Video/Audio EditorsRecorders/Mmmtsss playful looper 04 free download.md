What does "MmmTsss" mean?

ItA's a sound: a bass drum in your throat (mmm) and then a little hi-hat on
your teeth (tsss). Do this over and over, bobbing your head, and youA've got
your own party. Mmmtsss mmmtsss mmmtsss mmmtsss....

How can MmmTsss improve my life?

Mmmtsss is free software for playful looping. To be honest, itA's an excuse to
make mouth noises. Just have fun and make music together!

How do I use Mmmtsss?

When you open it up, it will be clicking out a beat. Hold down the mouse
button to record a sound. Let go to listen to your sound repeating, then hold
down the button again to record some more onto the loop. ThereA's more- the
instructions are right on the screen.
