NINJAM is a program to allow people to make real music together via the
Internet. Every participant can hear every other participant. Each user can
also tweak their personal mix to his or her liking. It uses compressed audio
which allows it to work with any instrument or combination of instruments. You
can sing, play a real piano, play a real saxophone, play a real guitar with
whatever effects and guitar amplifier you want, anything. If your computer can
record it, then you can jam with it.
