**Publisher's Description**  
  

A complete pattern based music making application that lets you sequence via a
X0X style programming interface (and record to .wav and .mp3 file), songs
consisting of sounds in up to 10 independent channels. The sounds can be any
.wav files of your choice, or sounds you synthesize with the application
itself, or combinations of the two.

Features note resolution to 32nds, lets you chain patterns upto 999 measures,
dynamically vary pan, pitch and level of each sound in each channel, as well
as each soundAs start and end point while the sequence is playing. You can
mute and solo sounds, automatically chop up loops into individual hits and
sequence them, set swing and accent, lock BPMs of sounds in channels to master
tempo, specify which sounds can cut-off which other sounds while playing,
auto-generate arpeggiator patterns, apply a myriad of effects and parametric
EQ to the sounds and randomize sound and note selection. You can operate it in
standalone mode, or slave playback via midi-sync to another DAW or external
sequencer.
