**Publisher's Description**  
  


Vox Recorder is a Windows application which will allow recording sound from an audio source only when an audio signal is present. Its main purpose is to avoid the recording of the silence eventually present at the input. 

Vox Recorder has been designed in particular for radio-scanner hobbists. If you are one of them, you already know how much time has to be spent when monitoring a new frequency: the traffic on the new channel is very sparse and communications are short, with long pauses between each one.

With Vox Recorder you can compress a whole dayA's worth of monitoring onto a single .wav file.

You can leave the computer on and connected to a scanner at home while you are at the office or doing something else; later, you can listen the messages caught by your radio how many times you want. In this way you can quickly monitor suspicious channels and have all the "action" into a single audio file.
