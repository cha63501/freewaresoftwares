**Publisher's Description**  
  

CUE Splitter is a freeware tool that split a single big audio track, mostly an
album or a compilation, into the relative individual audio tracks, using
informations contained in the associated "CUE" file.

Sometimes you can find a big compressed audio file (for example MP3, APE,
FLAC, OGG, WAV, WMA, etc...) equipped with a small "CUE" text file that
contain informations about tracks title, artist and length. Usually these
couple of files are generated by programs like EAC (Exact Audio Copy), CDRWin,
BPM Studio, GoldWave or similar.

With CUE Splitter you can split audio track files without burning to CDR or
decode/re-encode any audio data! Moreover audio files are automatically named
using a user-defined "file mask" string, itA's tags are filled with
information extracted from "CUE" file and, optionally, an M3U playlist file
can be generated (option enabled by default).
