**Publisher's Description**  
  

This kangaroo-themed program allows the user to create their own music and
sound effects, effectively from scratch.

This program differs from the Kangas Sound Editor (already listed on
Freewarefiles.com) in the programA's database: whereas Kangas Sound Editor
requires MySQL, Kangas Sound Editor QI does not (it uses an internal database
instead).

It uses a system of boxes or cells, which are placed by the user onto a
timeline using drag-and-drop, and which represent entities such as chords,
repetition, and individual sounds or notes.

The programA's database allows the user to create and store harmonics, used
for constructing melodic instruments, and anti-harmonics, which are used for
constructing percussion instruments.

Users can collaborate with each other, and build on the work of others via an
XML import/export facility.

Requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.7 or above. [Get It
