**Publisher's Description**  
  

mpgedit is an MPEG 1 layer 1/2/3 (mp3), MPEG 2, and MPEG 2.5 audio file editor
that is capable of processing both Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Variable Bit
Rate (VBR) encoded files. mpgedit can cut an input MPEG file into one or more
output files, as well as join one or more input MPEG files into a single
output file. Since no file decoding / encoding occurs during editing, there is
no audio quality loss when editing with mpgedit. When editing VBR files that
have a XING header, mpgedit updates the output fileA's XING header information
to reflect the new file size and average bit rate.

mpgedit operates in two modes: a command line and a curses-based, full-screen
interactive shell. All editing functionality is available in both modes. The
chief advantage of the interactive mode comes when using the playback feature
for selection and verification of edit begin and end times, which is more
rapidly performed interactively.

xmpgedit provides most of the same editing capabilities as the curses-mode
mpgedit, but adds a graphical representation of the volume levels of mp3 file
being being edited.
