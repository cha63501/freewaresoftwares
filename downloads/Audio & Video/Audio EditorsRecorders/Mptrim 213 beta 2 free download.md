mpTrim is a simple and easy to use MP3 editor. Use it to improve your MP3
collection.

What exactly can mpTrim do for you?

  * mpTrim can trim MP3s - removing silent or unwanted parts. 
  * mpTrim can adjust the volume of MP3s. Volume change can be manual or automatic (volume normalization). 
  * mpTrim can fade-in/out MP3s (to fix abrupt beginning/ending). 
  * mpTrim can clean-up MP3s and recover wasted disk space. 
  * mpTrim keeps the music quality intact, no matter how many times you process an MP3, because it works directly in the MP3 format without having to decode/re-encode. That also makes it very fast.
