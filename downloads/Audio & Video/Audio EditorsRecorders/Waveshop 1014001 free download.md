**Publisher's Description**  
  

WaveShop is an audio editor for Windows XP/Vista/7. Unlike many similar apps,
WaveShop is bit-perfect, meaning samples aren't altered unless they need to
be. Editing a portion of an audio file only affects that portion; the rest of
the file is untouched.

Blocks of audio can be cut and pasted without changing their contents at all.
This is especially useful for patching a finished master without corrupting
its dither.

**Features:**

  * Bit-perfect: samples aren't changed needlessly 
  * Very fast: all processing is done in memory 
  * 64-bit version can edit files exceeding 2GB 
  * Clipboard: Copy/Cut/Paste/Insert/Delete 
  * Unlimited undo 
  * Normalize and/or fix DC offset 
  * Amplify (boost/attenuate) 
  * Fade in/out/custom, linear or logarithmic 
  * Peak statistics 
  * RMS statistics with histogram 
  * Reversal and inversion 
  * Find clipping with detailed report 
  * Extract channels to mono files 
  * Insert/delete/swap channels 
  * Change audio format 
  * Generate audio w/ envelopes and modulation 
  * Edit surround speaker assignments 
  * Find zero crossing 
  * Multiple Document Interface (MDI) 
  * Multithreaded processing 
  * Playback via DirectSound
