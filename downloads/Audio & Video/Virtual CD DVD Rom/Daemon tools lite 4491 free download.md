**Publisher's Description**  
  

Daemon-Tools is an advanced application for multiprotection emulation. It is
further development of Generic Safedisc emulator and incorporates all its
features. This program allows running Backup Copies of SafeDisc (C-Dilla),
Securom or Laserlock protected games. Also included is a Virtual DVDROM drive
(V386 STEALTH DVDROM) enabling you to use your CD images as if they were
already burned to CD! DAEMON Tools works under Windows9x/ME/NT/2000/XP with
all types of CD/DVDROM drives (IDE/SCSI) and supports nearly any CD
protection.

**Features:**

  * Daemon-Tools needs a 1:1 Copy to run!! 
  * Daemon-Tools is used to RUN GAMES, NOT TO BURN THEM!!! Means emulation must be active while you want to play a game, not while burning the copy (except for you want to use DAEMON ToolsA' "fastdump" feature on a safedisc protected CD). 
  * If you want to run a copy protected application from an image mounted to a STEALTH DVDROM enabling the copy protection emulation(s) is NOT necessary!! 
  * STEALTH DVDROM is able to run nearly every protected or unprotected CD image (SafediscA(r), SecuromA(r), LaserlockA(r), LockblocksA(r) etc.) like it was the original CD! Just do an image file using one of the supported burning programs and mount it with Daemon Manager! 
Daemon-Tools supports the following image files:

  * cue/bin 
  * iso 
  * ccd (CloneCD) 
  * bwt (Blindwrite) 
  * mds (Media Descriptor File) 
  * cdi (Disjuggler) 
  * nrg (Nero - must have ImageDrive installed)
