**Publisher's Description**  
  


MaxLister is a free application which allows you to create virtual images of harddrives, floppy disks, CD-ROMs or other removable media. This is useful if you want to keep track of that vast CD collection, a problem that a lot of people come across these days. 

With MaxLister, you can save any drive or folder to a .MXL-file - a database file - and later browse and search it in a Windows Explorer interface. You can import new folders/filenames from another MXL-file if you want to keep different drives in a common file. You can also batch search through a multiple number of MXL-files so that you donA't have to load every single file and then repetedly search through them; looking for that particular filename. 

The MXL file also contains filesizes, and a comment so that you can personalize your information about the drive. If you donA't want to create a viewable database, you can choose to store your drive information in a plain text file - easy to view and share with people who donA't already have MaxLister. 

The plain text formats are separated in 3 different layouts: Collapsed, Folders only and Folders and Filenames.
