**Publisher's Description**  
  

MaxLister is a free application which allows you to create virtual images of
harddrives, floppy disks, CD-ROMs or other removable media. This is useful if
you want to keep track of that vast CD collection, a problem that a lot of
people come across these days.

With MaxLister, you can save any drive or folder to a .MXL-file - a database
file - and later browse and search it in a Windows Explorer interface. You can
import new folders/filenames from another MXL-file if you want to keep
different drives in a common file. You can also batch search through a
multiple number of MXL-files so that you donA't have to load every single file
and then repetedly search through them; looking for that particular filename.

The MXL file also contains filesizes, and a comment so that you can
personalize your information about the drive. If you donA't want to create a
viewable database, you can choose to store your drive information in a plain
text file - easy to view and share with people who donA't already have
MaxLister.

The plain text formats are separated in 3 different layouts: Collapsed,
Folders only and Folders and Filenames.
