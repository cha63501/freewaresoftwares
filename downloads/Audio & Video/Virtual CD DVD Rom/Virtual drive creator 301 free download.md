**Publisher's Description**  
  

Create Virtual Drives from long paths, itA's easy! Type the full path or (even
easier) browse to the path via the Drive and Folder Lists. Turn long paths
into letters with Virtual Drive Creator!

Choose a drive letter from the "Available Virtual Drive Letters" list and
Click [Add Virtual Drive] to create the Virtual Drive, or Double Click the
letter to create the Virtual Drive.

ItA's just as easy to remove a Virtual Drive, Double Click the letter you want
removed as a Virtual Drive or Click the letter and then Click [Remove Virtual
Drive].

Make CD-ROMs obsolete: Copy the contents of a CD-ROM to a folder, not the root
directory, on your Hard Drive. Make that folder a Virtual Drive (see paragraph
above), then install the Virtual CD from the Virtual Drive letter.

Click Start, Run and in the space provided type L:setup or L:install
(substitute your Virtual Drive letter for L and see the documentation that
came with your CD-ROM for the proper installation command).

Now every time you need to access the CD you can use the Virtual CD from your
hard drive. Be sure to make note of the Virtual Drive letter you used to
create the Virtual CD, when you reboot your computer you will need to re-
create the Virtual Drive using the same letter. (With the Pro Version of
Virtual Drive Creator you can make your Virtual Drives Permanent!)

Virtual Drive Creator (VDC) performs the DOS SUBST command from within
Windows. This allows you to use a drive letter to specify a complete directory
path (d:foldersub1sub2etc).
