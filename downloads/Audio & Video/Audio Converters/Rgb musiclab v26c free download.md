**Publisher's Description**  
  

RGB MusicLab converts RGB (Red, Green and Blue) value of an image to Chromatic
scale music. The program reads RGB value of pixels from the top left to the
bottom right of an image. One pixel makes a harmony of three note of RGB
value, and the length of note is decided by brightness of the pixel. RGB value
120 or 121 is the center C, and RGB value 122 or 123 is added a half steps of
the scale that is C#. Please listen samples on the developerA's info site. You
can get the idea.

**Requires:** AppleA's [Quicktime](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Quicktime_program_14041.html).
