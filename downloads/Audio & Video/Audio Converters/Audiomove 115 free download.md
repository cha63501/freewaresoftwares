**Publisher's Description**  
  

AudioMove is a simple, easy to use GUI-based batch audio file copy-and-
conversion program.

You just tell it what files to convert, what format to convert them to, and
where to put the output files, and it does it.

**Features:**

  * Converts from any format that libsndfile can read, to WAV or AIFF format 
  * Uses libsamplerate for high-quality sample rate conversion to various sample rates (11.025kHz-192kHz) 
  * Supports 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit, or floating-point output sample widths 
  * Specify files to convert using file requester or drag-and-drop 
  * Multithreaded design for faster processing on multiprocessor machines 
  * Pipelined dataflow for efficient resource utilization 
  * Recursively batch-convert entire directory trees in a single step 
  * Conversion-batch sizes may be arbitrarily large (e.g. thousands of files at a time) 
  * Can be controlled from the command line (useful for invoking batch conversions from scripts) 
  * No installation necessary -- just unzip and run (well, actually the Win32 version does come as a .msi file) 
  * Qt-based GUI means AudioMove is portable to most major OSA's 
  * Open source (GPL); source code is available below 
  * SUSE 9.1, MacOS/X and Windows binaries available below for your convenience. 
Additional downloads for Linux and MacOS/X are available at the [developerA's
website](http://www.lcscanada.com/audiomove/).
