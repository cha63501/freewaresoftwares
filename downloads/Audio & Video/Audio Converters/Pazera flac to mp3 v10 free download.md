**Publisher's Description**  
  

_Pazera FLAC to MP3_ is a free program that converts **FLAC** files (Free
Lossless Audio Codec) to **MP3** or **WAV** format. In addition, the program
allows you to extract audio tracks from audio files based on the CUE sheet.
CUE files are often attached to the Audio CD images created by programs like
EAC (Exact Audio Copy), CDRWin, CUERipper.

To convert audio streams to MP3 the application uses the latest version of the
LAME encoder. The program supports encoding with a constant bit rate -
**CBR**, average bitrate - **ABR** and variable bit rate - **VBR** (LAME
presets). Metadata (**tags**) from the source FLAC and CUE files are copied to
the output MP3 files.

Basic operation of the program is very simple: just _drag & drop_ FLAC or CUE
files into main window, select the _Default encoder settings_ in the Profile
list and click the _CONVERT_ button.  
More advanced users can customize many encoding parameters: audio bitrate,
bitrate mode, number of audio channels, audio sampling frequency, volume, time
range and other.

Note!  
Some older MP3 players support only MP3 files encoded at a constant bitrate -
CBR.
