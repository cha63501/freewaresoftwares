**Publisher's Description**  
  

_Free WebM to MP3 Converter_ is a totally free program that converts **WebM**,
**MP4**, **FLV** and **3GP** files to **MP3** or **WAV** format. Movies in
these formats are used by most popular video sites. Additionally, the program

If you have a collection of music videos downloaded from video sites and want

**CBR**, average bitrate - **ABR** and variable bit rate - **VBR** (LAME
presets).

Basic operation of the program is very simple: just _drag & drop_ WebM, MP4,
FLV or 3GP files into main window, select the _Default encoder settings_ in
the Profile list and click the _CONVERT_ button.  
More advanced users can customize many encoding parameters: audio bitrate,
bitrate mode, number of audio channels, audio sampling frequency, volume, time
range and other.
