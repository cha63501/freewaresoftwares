**Publisher's Description**  
  

_Pazera MP4 to MP3_ is a free program that converts **MP4**, **M4A**, **M4B**
and **AAC** files to **MP3** or **WAV** format. Tags (artist, title, album,
cover etc.) from the source files are copied to the output MP3 files.

To convert audio streams to MP3 the application uses the latest version of the
LAME encoder. The program supports encoding with a constant bit rate -
**CBR**, average bitrate - **ABR** and variable bit rate - **VBR** (LAME
presets).

Basic operation of the program is very simple: just _drag & drop_ MP4, M4A,
M4B or AAC files into main window, select the _Default encoder settings_ in
the Profile list and click the CONVERT button.  
More advanced users can customize many encoding parameters: audio bitrate,
bitrate mode, number of audio channels, audio sampling frequency, volume, time
range and other.

Note!  
Some older MP3 players support MP3 files encoded only at a constant bitrate -
CBR.
