**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Mobile AMR converter uses Sony Ericsson AMR converter to convert AMR files (Adaptive Multi-Rate Codec, *.amr) to wave files (*.wav) and vice-versa in a user-friendly way. Also, you can directly convert MP3 to AMR files for use with your mobile. It can also save several wave files into one SP file and vice-versa. The program has a very easy-to-use and simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) that helps even the most amateur user. Most of the times, the only data that you must enter are the input file(s) and the output file. The AMR format is used by many mobile phones right now, for sound recordings and for MMS (message with sound, picture and text for view in cell phones).
