**Publisher's Description**  
  

_Free FLV to MP3_ is a totally free program that converts Flash Video files
(**FLV**, **F4V**, **F4P**, **F4A** and **F4B**) to **MP3** or **WAV** format.
Additionally, the program allows you to extract original audio tracks from
Flash Video files **without loss of sound quality**.

The program also lets you add tags (artist, album, title, year, etc.) to the
generated MP3 or AAC files.

If you have a collection of music videos in FLV format downloaded from video
sites (eg YouTube, Yahoo! Video, metacafe) and want to convert them to MP3, or
save the original audio tracks to audio files, this program is for you!

To convert audio streams to MP3 the application uses the latest version of the
LAME encoder. The program supports encoding with a constant bit rate -
**CBR**, average bitrate - **ABR** and variable bit rate - **VBR** (LAME
presets).

Basic operation of the program is very simple: just _drag & drop_ FLV, F4V,
F4P, F4A or F4B files into main window, select the _Default encoder settings_
in the Profile list and click the CONVERT button.  
More advanced users can customize many encoding parameters: audio bitrate,
bitrate mode, number of audio channels, audio sampling frequency, volume, time
range and other.

Note!  
Some older MP3 players support MP3 files encoded only at a constant bitrate -
CBR.

  * The program is **portable**: it does not use system registry and all settings are stored in INI files. Thus, the program can be run from portable devices such as pendrives, removable drives.
