Use MP3 Quality Modifier for quick and easy quality edits of your music files
- ItA's uncomplicated, portable and free!

MP3 Quality Modifier is a straightforward program that is able to easily
change the quality of your MP3A's in order to save disk space and/or to fit
more music on your MP3 player while maintaining the desired level of audio
quality and keeping all ID3 tags intact!

The program is pretty simple to use: The first step is to drag and drop MP3
files on the file list, MP1 and MP2 files are supported as well. Various
information such as the name, interpret, size and bitrate are displayed
automatically.  
The next step is to select a preset which ranges from high quality over
portable and compromise to low quality. More advanced users can choose from a
variety of configurations such as bitrate mode and rate, sample frequency and
the stereo modus.

The process itself takes only a few seconds per song and is even able to adapt
the folder structure (example: "Artist X" folder with "Album 1" and "Album 2"
as subfolders) if that is wanted. Unlike other tools all ID3 tags like the
title, artist etc. are automatically retained as well. Finally the result
window allows to compare the original and created music files by listing their
size differences.

MP3 Quality Modifier is portable, doesnA't need an installation and is
powerful but easy to understand!

No special system requirements are needed.

**What's New in version 2.53:**

  * Added: Confirmation question for shutdown option at progress window 
  * Fixed: Some slightly corrupt or very small MP3 files weren't handled properly 
  * Fixed: Better detection of processing problems
