**Publisher's Description**  
  


File Sorting Utility is speciallized for renaming and sorting mp3 files. FSU reads and writes ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags and can create filenames based on these and a userdefined pattern. FSU can add/remove/fix tags to perfection for you. By fixing means that FSU figures out the artist, title, track, album... and puts them in the tags. With the powerful tag editor you can add/remove/change/fix tags in multiple files with the click of a button. New in this version is autodetection of inpattern, simple edit mode and much more.
