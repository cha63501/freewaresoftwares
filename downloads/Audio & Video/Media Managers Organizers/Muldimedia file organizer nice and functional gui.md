**Publisher's Description**  
  


JeniuS is an universal file organizer and is the main element in the [JeniuS programs suite](http://www.jockersoft.com/english/jenius_suite.php). 

It lets you organize your files in macro categories (audio, video, images...) and micro categories (author, genre, album, movie, photo, icon...). Files can be inserted into user-defined albums (i.e.: a music files collection) or into automatically generated ones. For every album you can specify the artistA's name, a short description, an image (i.e.: the CD cover or the movie poster), the year and the gender.

Every file inserted in JeniuS will be deeply analyzed and the most important information will be extracted: if it is a mp3 JeniuS will read id3 tags and will detect the bitrate, frequency, length..., if it is a video JeniuS will detect the codec, dimensions, number of frames per second... These information are stored in JeniuSA' library and are used to catalog the file in the categories it fits best and to be able to find it easily in a second time.

There are several ways to find again a file stored in the library: for example, considering an audio file, you can select an album, the artist or the genre; show all audio files and then filter results; perform a basic or advanced search combining more search parameters; open the folder where the file is physically stored in.

Selecting one or more files all the information detected and inserted by the user are shown. Clicking on a few of them are displayed all the files that have the same info. It is possible to rate (from corrupt to +5) and express a comment on every file. Ratings let JeniuS to generate an automatic playlist according to usersA' tastes in fact of music, letting him listening for example only the music he likes most. Files not yet opened are displayed with a different color: this is very useful to know which files are to be seen/listened.

JeniuS is only the main program of a bigger suite of softwares that includes:

  * a powerful batch file renamer: itA's functions vary from simple word replacement to automatic common errors correction, from inserting a progressive number to convert filenames in H4(K3R ("hacker", useless function but nice :-) )
