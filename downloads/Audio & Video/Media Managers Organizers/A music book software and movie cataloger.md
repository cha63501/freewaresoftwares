**Publisher's Description**  
  


Data Crow is a music (audio CDA's and mp3, ogg, flac, ape, .. files), book, software and movie cataloger. It is platform independent and easy to install. Data Crow uses internet services like amazon.com, imdb.com and freedb.org to retrieve information. ItA's platform-independent and is easy to use.. 

Data Crow is an open source project developed by Robert Jan van der Waals. The project began in 2002 under the name "CD Library". After further development, CD Library was deemed to be an obsolete name because it no longer reflected the programA's functionality and the project was renamed Data Crow.

For those who like to collect software, books, movies and or music, Data Crow can help! The program needs only a little input from you to register your collection. For example, registering a piece of software is as easy as inputting the softwareA's name or publisher and Data Crow retrieves the rest of the information from Amazon. For audio files, itA's even simpler! Just browse to the directory that contains the audio files and Data Crow reads and imports the embedded tag information (artist, album name, track name, and so on).
