**Publisher's Description**  
  


MP3 CatalogMaker-Pro is a utility designed to help you organize your existing mp3 files. 

Over time, mp3 files you have accumulated can become scattered all over your hard drive and may lead to difficulty in locating your music files. Since mp3 files tend to be rather large, this can also lead to an enormous amount of wasted disk space.

MP3 CatalogMaker-Pro is designed to help eliminate many of these problems. It can help to locate duplicate files, and provides any easy to use interface that gives you complete control over how you catalog your mp3 files. You can even print a list of all of your cataloged files or even email them to a friend. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
