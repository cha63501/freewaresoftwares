**Publisher's Description**  
  

Mamba is your one click solution to music tags. You can fix your entire
library by correcting missing tags, repairing inconsistencies, and finding
album information from the Amazon music store either automatically or
manually.

Mamba also shows you exactly which songs are missing certain tags and lets you
concentrate on problem areas. Mamba is perfect to finally clean up your
neglected collection or periodically fix new songs in your library.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or
above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).

Note: Mamba 0.2 Beta is pre-release software and is still in testing. It is
reccomended that you back up your music collection before using Mamba since
bugs may arise and cause ones song tags to be altered.
