**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Movie library application is a Java program designed to keep your videos organized or your PC. You can import almost any type of video (using drag and drop) and fill in information about the videos yourself or let the program guess the movie/series from the file name and link to our database, to get the information. You can also convert the videos to many different video types using the preset profiles provided. 

For easy installation and stable running it is recommended to use [VLC media player](http://www.freewarefiles.com/VLC-Media-Player-VideoLAN_program_13617.html) or SMPlayer for the video playback and have one of them installed before the installation of this program. Some other video players will work with this software but you will have to browse and select it manually from inside the program on first run of the program. 

To convert DVDs to avi (Xvid,H.264) use a tool like [DVD Decrypter](http://www.freewarefiles.com/DVD-Decrypter_program_15586.html) to rip the appropriate VOB files, do not use any file splitting (This is how to disable it in DVD Decrypter. Click on Tools-->Settings--> IFO Mode-->Options-->File Splitting - None), then import the .vob file into the application and convert as usual.
