**Publisher's Description**  
  

Collbee is a free media manager that automatically scans your media collection
and downloads various information about your media files. The main goal while
developing Collbee was to let it operate automatically without you having to
do anything. It uses popular public movie and TV show databases to get the
information about your media files. It also handles renaming files and
folders.

Additionally, it downloads artwork images from the Internet. Last but not
least, Collbee supports integration with popular media centers such as XBMC or
Windows Media Center.
