**Publisher's Description**  
  


tinyMediaManager is aptly named considering its size and functions. The lightweight application is only 523KB but it packs more features than you would expect in such a small program. You can use it to get all relevant metadata for movies from different sites. 

For example, you can get artwork or trailers from Fanart.tv, TheMovieDB.org and HD-Trailers.net. You can use the mediainfo library to extract technical metadata from the movies you have, and its regular expressions can detect seasons and episodes from TV shows. It also offers an edit function that allows you to change the scraper results you get to suit your own preferences.

You can use tinyMediaManager to search, filter and sort your movies using different criteria, which make it easy to access required movies. You can also organize your file structure by renaming both movies and their respective folders.

Requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 or above. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com).
