**Publisher's Description**  
  

WDFlow is an application that retrieves from the net the posters and data
about the movies and TV series.

Your WD TV Live Hub will display all the information (actors, directors,
overview, release date...), the posters and backdrops. This changes the
experience of using the device, black squares are gone, and replaced with a
truly attractive interface.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
