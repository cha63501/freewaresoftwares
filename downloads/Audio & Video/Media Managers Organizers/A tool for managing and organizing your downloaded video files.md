**Publisher's Description**  
  


Vee-Hive was created for the purpose of managing and organizing your multimedia files. Its powerful feature-set makes it an ideal solution for cataloguing large collections of media content, even if that content is stored across multiple storage devices. 

Through its easy-to-use interface, it is possible to quickly and easily locate any file in your collection and play it back.

**Features:**

  * Support for userA's default Media Player 
  * Auto-creation of Library, including thumbnail generation 
  * Support for advanced Tagging, using hierarchies, links and synonyms (tag your tags!) 
  * Ability to perform complex, compound searches in order to identify and locate files (combine anything with anything!) 
  * Navigable Tag Cloud! 
  * Ability to create and playback AhighlightA segments from your files 
  * Facilitates basic editing of files (through external applications, where installed) 
  * Caters for collections that span multiple storage devices, whether connected or not (HDDs/CDs/Data DVDs/RAM Disks/USB Drives/etc.) 
  * Ability to create and organise dynamic playlists 
  * Ability to generate Story Board images of files (commonly used as previews by file uploaders) 
  * Facilitates identification of duplicate files 
  * Supports real and virtual drives and UNC paths 
  * TV-Out mode allows Library management from your armchair (via a remote control or similar input device) 
Vee-Hive is a Direct Show-based application and, hence, it can play-back any media type for which your system has the necessary filters installed. My recommendation, if you are not already using it, is to have ffdshow installed, together with the Haali Media Splitter to handle MPEG-2 and Matroska streams. You may wish to supplement this a Flash (FLV) filter. 

**WhatA's new in version 1.8.5:**

  * [Technical] Upgraded capstill.dll component 
  * [Functional] Browser tooltips are now less obtrusive 
  * [Technical] RichClient component updated 
  * Other small improvements and bug fixes
