mcat is a cataloging tool for multimedia CD/DVD collections. This is its primary target, as it provides some specialized features for multimedia, but it can be used to catalog any bytes stored on a removable device or on the hard disk. 

mcat can help you organize your multimedia collection by:

  * scanning removable media (like DVDs or CDs) or hard disk folders and storing file structure for offline browsing and searching 
  * providing you with extra valuable info for audio/video files.
