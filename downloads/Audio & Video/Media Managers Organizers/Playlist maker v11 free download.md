**Publisher's Description**  
  

Playlist maker searches for all of your mp3 files and makes playlists out of
them. I find it very useful if you have more than 30 albums. You can save all
the playlists to one folder and then just select from there what album you
want to listen.

**Features:**

  * Makes playlists with full path.  

  * You can use centralized folder for playlists and/or save playlist to every folder.  

  * Naming done either from folder names or id3 tags.  

  * Easy to use.  

  * No installation. Just one executable file.  

  * Free.
