**Publisher's Description**  
  

Rampage Media Organizer is a small tool that helps you organize you media
(mp3,mpg,avi etc) files into seperate folders for each file depending on its
file name.

First, Rampage Media Organizer scans your media folder for all files and loads
them into a list. It examines the file name of the particular file, and tries
to determine a folder name from the file name. If successful, the new folder
name is added to the list along with the file name. If not successful, the
file name is added without a folder name and you have the option to edit the
folder name by hand.

You can also optionally remove files that you donA't wish to include when the
files are organized. After you are confident that the list is correct, click
on A'OrganizeA' & Rampage Media Organizer will organize the files for you.

Rampage Media Organizer also has a feature that will create a directory
listing from a folder including all sub folders. You can access this feature
by clicking on A'ExportA' beneath the organization list. D-Lister(Lite) is the
sub program that performs the directory listing for you.

It is a small version of another program integrated into Rampage Media
Organizer. You can use this feature before or after you organize your files,
In fact you can use D-Lister(Lite) without using the organizer at all.
