**Publisher's Description**  
  


Some tools (like nLite and XPlite) allow you to remove Windows Media Player from your system or even prevent it from ever being installed. The downside to this is that vital components for Windows Media playback are also removed. As a result you wonA't be able to play Windows Media files in your browser or in your favorite player. A solution for this problem is Windows Media Lite, which restores those vital components. 

Windows Media Lite was specially created for those people who have removed WMP 7/9/10 from Windows XP/2003 using tools like nLite or XPlite, but do want to be able to play and stream Windows Media content. This package is also useful for Windows 2000 users who only have Windows Media Player 6.4 installed.

After installing this package you should be able to play Windows Media content in your browser and also in most players (for example Media Player Classic). Even those websites that normally require WMP9 or higher to be installed.

**Includes:**

  * Windows Media Codecs (DirectShow/VCM/DMO) 
  * Windows Media Core Components 
  * Windows Media Player 10 Core Components and IE plugin 
  * Windows Media Browser plugin for Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, Netscape and Opera 
  * Audio Codecs 
**Do NOT use this package if you have Windows Media Player 7/9/10 installed!**
