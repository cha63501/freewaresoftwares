K-Lite Mega Codec Pack is a free software bundle which includes the K-Lite Codec Pack Full and Real Alternative. Codec is short for Compressor-Decompressor. Codecs are needed for encoding and decoding (playing) audio and video. The K-Lite Codec Pack is designed as a user-friendly solution for playing all your movie files. With the K-Lite Codec Pack you should be able to play all the popular movie formats and even some rare formats. 

The K-Lite Codec Pack has a couple of major advantages compared to other codec packs:
