K-Lite Mega Codec Pack is a free software bundle which includes the K-Lite
Codec Pack Full and Real Alternative. Codec is short for Compressor-
Decompressor. Codecs are needed for encoding and decoding (playing) audio and
video. The K-Lite Codec Pack is designed as a user-friendly solution for
playing all your movie files. With the K-Lite Codec Pack you should be able to
play all the popular movie formats and even some rare formats.
