**Publisher's Description**  
  

This is a bundle of 64-bit DirectShow filters that can be used together with
64-bit players, such as Vista Media Center. This pack can co-exist without
problems with the regular (32-bit) K-Lite Codec Pack.

The 64-bit versions of Windows can run 32-bit software perfectly fine. So it
is recommended to use the regular K-Lite Codec Pack when possible. That one
contains more, better and faster decoders. You only need 64-bit filters for
use with 64-bit applications.

Works on 64-bit versions of Windows XP/2003/Vista/2008/Seven.
