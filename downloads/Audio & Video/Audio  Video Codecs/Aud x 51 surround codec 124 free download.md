**Publisher's Description**  
  

Aud-X is the name of a completely new surround sound encoder and decoder
created by group of audio enthusiasts and professionals joined with love to
the Cinema. For a long time people converted DVDs to Divx/Xvid with mp3 stereo
sound. We have all felt that part of the orginal masterpiece was gone forever
(the surround sound).

The main Aud-X project task was to bring to people an easy technology for
encoding Divx/Xvid movies with 5.1 sound the same way they used to do it with
the simple mp3 stereo encoders. Since Aud-X 5.1 sounds great at 128 kbps and
is compatible with AVI A you can reencode DVDs the same way you are used to,
but with full surround sound. Test Aud-X! Read our Aud-X DVD to Divx/Xvid
conversion guide.
