**Publisher's Description**  
  

LAME is an educational tool to be used for learning about MP3 encoding. The
goal of the LAME project is to use the open source model to improve the psycho
acoustics, noise shaping and speed of MP3. LAME is not for everyone - it is
distributed as source code only and requires the ability to use a C compiler.
However, many popular ripping and encoding programs include the LAME encoding
engine.
