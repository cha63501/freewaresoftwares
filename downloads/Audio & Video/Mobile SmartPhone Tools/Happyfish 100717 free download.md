**Publisher's Description**  
  

HappyFish is an RSS reader that will download RSS enclosures (podcasts,
mp3A's, pics, videos, apps, whatever) to your PC while you watch - or better
still - while you play with the kids, eat sushi, read a book, ponder the
meaing of life, sleep...

Aside from being an RSS reader and enclosure manager, for any comapatable
device (USB based MP3 players, CF or SD Cards, USB Flash Drives etc., and soon
iTunes and iPods) you can:

  * Move all downloads to your device. 
  * Move only downloads from the last xx number of days to your device. 
  * Move everything from the feed(s) of your choice to your device. 
  * Move specific files only. 
  * Optionally mirror deletes from your device to your HappyFish library.
