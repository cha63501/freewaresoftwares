**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you have an Android Smartphone, then you can connect it to your computer
via DroidPad and use it as a joystick. This means you can use the cell phone
to perform different activities, particularly gaming. The application is
compatible with both Wi-Fi and USB connections.

You will need to install DroidPad on both your computer and [Android
phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.digitalsquid.droidpad)
to establish a connection. Once you have established a connection using either
USB or Wi-Fi, the PC client will recognize your mobile device. If it does not
recognize the phone automatically, you will need to add a custom device by
entering the relevant port and hostname address.

When you have successfully connected the phone, you can use it to control the
mouse cursor. You can perform different functions depending on the mode you
have chosen. DroidPad works in Mouse, Joystick and Slideshow modes. When you
use the Joystick mode, you can control games via on-screen buttons you will
see on your mobile device.

In Mouse mode, you can use your cell phoneAs screen as a notebook trackpad.
You can also tilt the phone to move the cursor. Alternatively, you may use the
Android phoneAs gyroscope, which is more complex.

You can reorganize on-screen buttons and axes depending on the game you want
to play. You do not have to miss the games you enjoy for lack of a joystick.
