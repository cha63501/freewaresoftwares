**Publisher's Description**  
  


iTwin is a program for the Windows PC, that will show the content of your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad databases in a quite familliar look & feel. Finally you have a backup of your contacts, text messages (sms), calendar entries, notes and caller-history. In addition iTwin will generate a birthday-list including zodiacs from your contact details. 

iTwin can read your databases in two different ways. First, you get instant access to your data using your WiFi network. The second way works by analysing your iTunes-backup-files, where where it is not nessesary to jailbreak your iPhone or iPod Touch!

You can now organize different backups, with the opportunity to just look up something, even without your hands on the iPhone itself. It may stay in the docking station, or maybe it is the device of your partner, and therefore even physically out of reach. iTwin is also very helpful, when your iPhone is broken or has been stolen and you urgently need to know your contact-details or upcomming appointments!

Think about a private-backup outside of iTunes, with the option of switching between different device-contents. iTwin will assist you as a backup-viewer, showing every personal entry and finally all your text-messages are now save!
