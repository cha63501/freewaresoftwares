you want to listen to from your iTunes library and The Filter will generate a
playlist for you that suits the mood you are in. It saves hours of your time
and will rekindle your love of your music collection. Even the most dedicated

**Keep your iPod interesting.**

How often have you had your iPod on shuffle and ended up on the treadmill
listening to Joy Division instead of Basement Jaxx?

The iPod Refresher function will put an end to this frustration by creating
playlists for specific activities, such as getting to work or going to the
gym. And whatAs more it can refresh those playlists each and every time you
sync your iPod (or compatible player) to keep them from getting boring.
