**Publisher's Description**  
  

evasi0n7 is an untethered jailbreak for all iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad
mini models running iOS 7.0 through 7.0.x.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

  * Backup your device using iTunes (or iCloud) before using evasi0n. If something breaks, youA'll always be able to recover your data. 
  * Those who use backup passwords in iTunes must disable them for now. After doing so, iTunes makes a brand new backup. Please wait for that backup to complete before proceeding! Feel free to re-enable your backup password after jailbreaking. 
  * Please disable the lock passcode of your iOS device before using evasi0n. It can cause issues. 
  * Launch evasi0n, plug in your device, and click "Jailbreak". Just sit back and observe its progress. Watch for any steps you may be asked to perform. 
  * Avoid all iOS and iTunes related tasks until evasi0n is complete. Why not just enjoy a brief break from the computer to stretch your legs? 
  * If the process gets stuck somewhere, itA's safe to restart the program, reboot the device (if necessary by holding down Power and Home until it shuts down), and rerun the process. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.0.8:**

  * support for 7.0_11A466 that shipped with some 5s and 5c iPhones
