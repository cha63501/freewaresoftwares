**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pod Player is an application to be used with your iPod. It allows you to play
music from your iPod while it is connected to your PC.

When launched, it will look for an attached iPod and when it finds one it will
read the music database on the iPod. You will then be able to view your songs
in a similar way as in iTunes (by artist, genre, album, playlist, etc). You
can now also extract songs from it.

There are a few little extra features such as iPod Hacks, checking for
duplicates etc. You can play your music on any computer when your iPod is
connected without the need to install any programs such as iTunes.
