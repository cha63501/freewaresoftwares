If you have an Android Smartphone, then you can connect it to your computer via DroidPad and use it as a joystick. This means you can use the cell phone to perform different activities, particularly gaming. The application is compatible with both Wi-Fi and USB connections. 

You will need to install DroidPad on both your computer and [Android phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.digitalsquid.droidpad) to establish a connection. Once you have established a connection using either USB or Wi-Fi, the PC client will recognize your mobile device. If it does not recognize the phone automatically, you will need to add a custom device by entering the relevant port and hostname address.

When you have successfully connected the phone, you can use it to control the mouse cursor. You can perform different functions depending on the mode you have chosen. DroidPad works in Mouse, Joystick and Slideshow modes. When you use the Joystick mode, you can control games via on-screen buttons you will see on your mobile device.

In Mouse mode, you can use your cell phoneAs screen as a notebook trackpad. You can also tilt the phone to move the cursor. Alternatively, you may use the Android phoneAs gyroscope, which is more complex.

You can reorganize on-screen buttons and axes depending on the game you want to play. You do not have to miss the games you enjoy for lack of a joystick.
