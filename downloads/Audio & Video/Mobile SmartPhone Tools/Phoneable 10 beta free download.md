**Publisher's Description**  
  

Normally an iPhone is associated with just one iTunes library, and you can
only manage your music with that one copy of iTunes.

PhoneAble takes your iPhone library key and applies it to any number of other
iTunes installations, allowing you to manage your music on whatever computer
you happen to be at.
