There are various ways in which you can use a webcam, the most common one being chatting online. Due to their popularity, you will find many webcams in the market relatively cheaply. However, you have to look harder and spend more money if you want a webcam that connects to your computer wirelessly. It is therefore a relief to know that you can use an android webcam free of charge. If you have an android phone, then all you need is DroidCam software. 

This small application enables you to use an android phone as both a microphone and webcam. You wonAt have to worry about buying another gadget to connect to your computer.

**Using DroidCam**

Although we had the option to install audio software when installing DroidCam, we chose to skip it because the software makers did not recommend it for 64-bit computers as it was still in the experimental stage.

When we launched the application, it appeared on the top left corner of our computer screen, taking less than a sixth of the available space. The interface gave four ways through which we connect our phone to the computer:

  1. Connecting via WiFi 
  2. Connecting using USB cable 
  3. Creating PC server via WiFi 
  4. Creating PC server via Bluetooth 
We could select both video and audio but selected video only. We could also select different outputs, including whether to rotate the output and change the desired output size. 

_Please note that you have to install DroidCam client on your Android phone before you can access the phone and use it as a webcam._

To connect to phone via WiFi, we turned on WiFi and connected to the network as usual. We then started the DroiCam phone app, which displayed AStarting server.A Then we launched the Windows client and entered the IP and port numbers displayed on the phone client.

Connecting via USB required further configuration, which was simple. The DroidCam installation folder included an Android Debug Bridge, adb.exe, which we had to install. If you want to use USB but have not yet installed relevant drivers, then you will have to do so to establish a connection between your computer and phone.

We were then able to access our phone camera via our usual webcam software. We noticed that choosing the smallest image size gave the best images.

**Pros**

  * Small application 
  * Easy to use 
  * Connects smoothly 
  * Displays high quality images depending on the android webcam used 
  * Free 

**Cons**

  * The images tended to lag
