**Publisher's Description**  
  

PodLift is a Freeware program which allows you to browse the contents of any
iPod, listen to any tracks you want, and copy tracks and playlists to your
computer, either to the directory of your choice or directly into iTunes.

You can configure a few basic things, such as whether to let iTunes copy your
music for you, have PodLift copy it, or have PodLift copy it and not add it to
iTunes at all (iTunes is not actually required to use PodLift). You can also
configure how files are saved (whether to create artist\album directories, and
what information to include in the filename).

Podlift allows you to view any playlist on your iPod, and copy into any
playlist in iTunes.

PodLift uses the Apple QuickTime COM control to play tracks, so you need to
install QuickTime to use PodLift.

PodLift has no ads, does not access the internet at all and does not change
any settings in your computer.

Basically, PodLift is simple. PodLift is safe. PodLift is free.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/det
