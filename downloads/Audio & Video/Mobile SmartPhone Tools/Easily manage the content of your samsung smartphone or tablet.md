Samsung Company has released an updated version of Kies that is compatible with both its smart phones and tablets, including Android 4.3 and Note 3 devices. The Samsung phone manager enables Samsung Smartphone and tablet users to connect their devices to computers and manage content in the devices. The comprehensive program allows users to back up their contacts and other important data. They can also copy different types of media either to or from their mobile devices. 

**Installing Samsung Kies**

You need a good dose of patience if you want to install Samsung Kies properly because the process takes quite a while. However, this is understandable considering that it installs various drivers that Samsung mobile devices need to connect properly to a computer.

**Using Samsung Kies**

The program gave us two ways through which we could connect our phone to the computer: WiFi and USB cable. We tried both options and the connections were perfect. We wanted to know how the program worked right from its connectivity considering the numerous negatives reviews we had read online. However, we did not find any problem here.

We suspect one of the problems may be using an incompatible version of Kies. 

Samsung Kies: Smartphones, certain feature phones and tablets released before September 2013.

Samsung Kies 3: Supports Android 4.3 and Note 3 devices.

The program also requires the following software to run:

**Kies**

  * [DirectX v9.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/DirectX90c-Redistributable_program_516.html) or later 
  * [Windows Media Player 11](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Windows-Media-Player-XP_program_11691.html) or later 
  * [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3-5-SP1_program_31320.html) or later 

**Kies 3**

  * Windows 7, 8 OS N, KN: Windows Media Feature Pack 
  * Windows XP: [Windows Media Player 11](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Windows-Media-Player-XP_program_11691.html) or above 

Once we had connected our phone and computer, we were able to synchronize the two devices with relative ease. In addition to transferring pictures and videos to the computer, we had the option to use Kies music library to manage our music collection from the computer. We enjoyed our media files on the computer and freed space on our Smartphone by transferring files onto the computer.

Another feature that we liked in the newest version of Kies is the ability to keep our phone up to date with the latest software without going deeper into the program. When we connected the phone to the computer via USB cable, the program notified us of available updates automatically. It displayed both the current and latest firmware versions.

**Verdict**

Kies is a good Samsung phone manager but it takes time to run and uses relatively high system resources. We recommend it as a backup tool that will not only help you when something happens to your phone but also when you want to transfer content from one Samsung mobile device to another.
