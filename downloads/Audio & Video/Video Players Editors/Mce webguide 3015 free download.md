**Publisher's Description**  
  

MCE WebGuide was created for Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition users
to provide remote Internet access to scheduling and the management of recorded
programs on the Media Center Edition (MCE) PC.

MCE WebGuide features:

  * Allows you to schedule recordings of shows anytime and anywhere from a web browser. 
  * Installs quickly and runs with the familiar easy-to-use MCE interface. 
  * Accesses your own MCE PC which means live scheduling without delays. 
  * Provides LAN-based access to recorded TV shows via networked PCA's with playback in Windows Media Player. 
  * An improved homepage that provides quick access to recent and upcoming recordings. 
  * Improved guide listing that scrolls in-place, rather than scrolling the whole browser. This makes it very easy to get program info without having to scroll to the bottom of the page. 
  * A much improved search interface. Similar to Media Center, you can now get your search results grouped by show rather than just sorted by date/time. 
  * Ability to set manual recordings and adjust the settings of scheduled recordings. 
  * PocketPC and Smartphone enabled EPG. 
  * Localized languages include: Dutch, French, German, Norwegian and Swedish. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
nloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows
XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
