**Publisher's Description**  
  


MousaiPlayer is a surprisingly convenient solution for storing your media files such as music, video, images, and recorded TV. Playing and viewing these types of files with MousaiPlayer offers a very enjoyable experience to any type of user. 

The program includes a well-thought out interface both from a functional and esthetic point of view; it will appear familiar at first sight due to a very inspired and logical organization of icons and buttons each clearly stating its task when placing the cursor over them.

From the stylish colours of the interface to the way you can easily manage the files on your hard drive, MousaiPlayer makes a great choice when it comes to watching movie clips you have downloaded or recorded especially since it packs in a larger number of codecs than do most of similar programs. That means you donAt need to go search for codecs every time you are watching a more recent film or clip.

MousaiPlayer comes with a straightforward menu of commands, a playback window placed in the center, and a useful bar for information.
