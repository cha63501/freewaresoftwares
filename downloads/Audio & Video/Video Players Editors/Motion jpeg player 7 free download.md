**Publisher's Description**  
  

This player is one of the fastest player for IP Network cameras ever build. It
renders Motion JPEG streams from network cameras. The player has been tested
only with Axis IP Network (M-JPEG/JPEG) cameras. Nevertheless the player could
be easily adapted to work with cameras from others vendors.

Also you can play Motion JPEG streams on Java enabled wireless devices using
the J2ME MIDlet.
