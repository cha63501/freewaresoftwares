**Publisher's Description**  
  


Broadcast Yourself Live- Using TronMe anyone can mix and perform their favorites songs live on MSN, his blog,or even Mogulus; itA's a whole new level of interactivity that is certain to appeal to wannabe performers of all ages. Each song is separated into different tracks or building blocks and the software mixes these back together based on the movements detected through the computerA's web cam to provide an exclusive mix every time. 

The amazing part of this technology lies in its simplicity to use. TronMe is controlled purely from the webcam and, from the movements detected; the program creates a unique mix of the track. The player has total control of how the mix sounds. The direction of the movement determines which instrument plays. Stay in the middle and they are equal, move higher and the percussion is dominant. There is no end to the options and possibilities. Of course, no one ever moves the exact same way twice and so each time a song is played an entirely new mix is created. There are also plenty of effects to add onto the video to make the end result exceptionally professional.

TronMe is compatible with MSN, Skype and, of course, the home video recorder; the performance can be made all the more exciting by an audience or it can just be recorded in mp3 or avi to be watched back later.

A really exciting development is that users can perform their creations to the world! Each user will receive a free, live channel on which broadcast their personal performances. Using this channel, the video and audio mixes can be broadcast via any blog, on myspace or on facebook. TronMe will also have a master channel which will broadcast the best performances - a real incentive to keep practicing and put together a fantastic track!
