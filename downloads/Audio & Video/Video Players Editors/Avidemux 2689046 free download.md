**Publisher's Description**  
  

_What the heck is Avidemux?_  
  
Imagine an application which does everything VirtualDub can do, but runs on
various platforms, supports a lot of containers, comes with all Codecs you
need built-in and doesnA't use the nasty VfW interface. That applications is
Avidemux! And now the "official" version: Avidemux is a free video editor
designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks. ItA's graphical
user interface looks pretty similar to VirtualDub and most features known from
VirtualDub are available too. Avidemux natively supports a great number of
file types, such as AVI, MPEG, VOB, TS, MP4, ASF, OGM, MKV and FLV. At the
same time Avidemux natively supports a wide range of Video/Audio formats,
including MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP, H.264/AVC, DV, HuffYUV, MP3, AAC, AC-3
and Vorbis. Tasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful
scripting capabilities. Video-DVD or (S)VCD compliant streams can be created
with easy-to-use "Auto" wizards. Multi-threading is supported!  
  
  
_What encoders are supported by Avidemux?_  
  
Avidemux comes with several video encoders built-in: Xvid (MPEG-4 ASP), x264
(H.264 aka AVC), libavcodec (MPEG-4 ASP, MPEG-2, MPEG-1, FLV, HuffYUV, FFV1,
MJPEG, H.263, DV) and mpeg2enc (MPEG-1, MPEG-2). Also it includes various
audio encoders: LAME (MP3), FAAC (LC-AAC), Aften (AC3), Ogg Vorbis and TwoLAME
(MP2). Please note that Avidemux does not support the platform-specific and
outdated A'Video for WindowsA' (VfW) interface and it never will! This means
there is absolutely no way to use DivX (or any other VfW-based Codecs) with
Avidemux! But donA't worry: Avidemux will open all files, that were encoded
with DivX, just fine. Avidemux simply uses itA's own (internal) MPEG-4 decoder
instead of the proprietary DivX decoder. Furthermore the files encoded with
Avidemux and Xvid will play 100% fine on a "DivX certified" player, as long as
you use the appropriate encoder settings...  
  
  
_What video filters are supported by Avidemux?_  
  
Avidemux comes with a wide range of video filters built-in. Most of those
filters were ported from MPlayer, VirtaulDub or Avisynth. There are filters
for Cropping, Resizing (Bilinear, Bicubic and Lanczos) and Expanding. For
processing of interlaced video, there are various Deinterlacing and IVTC
filters (e.g. Yadif, TDeint, Kernel Deinterlacer, Smart Deinterlace,
mcDeinterlace, DGBob and Decomb Telecide). Furthermore there are filters for
Denoising (FluxSmooth, denoise3d/hqdn3d, Stabilize, Temporal Cleaner, etc.),
Sharpening (MSharpen, asharp, etc.), Color Correction and many more. Last but
not least there is a new plugin system for A'externalA' video filters now. So
you can add additional filters to Avidemux without re-compiling!
