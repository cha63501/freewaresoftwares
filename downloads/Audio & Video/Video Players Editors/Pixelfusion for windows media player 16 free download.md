**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pixelfusion is a unique new technology that processes digital video to make it
sharper and clearer. Most downloaded or streamed video tend to look A'blurryA'
due to a reduction in the resolution of the video in order to reduce download
time. When viewed, it is usually stretched, or resampled, to a higher
resolution, to make it easier to view.

Generally, a standard bilinear or bicubic algorithm is performed. Because they
only perform a simple mathematical interpolation which reproduces smooth
transitions from one pixel to another, they will always cause an image to
appear more blurry. PixelFusion is different, by attempting to more accurately
predict the pixels that existed in the original high resolution source, and
create a much crisper and perceptually clearer image.

**Features:**

  * Pixelfusion resolution enhancement at Medium quality (150% x 150%) 
  * 5 sharpness settings. 
  * Auto lighting option, to allow automatic adjustment of brightness and contrast according to how dark or bright a scene is. 
  * Ability to manually enable/disable Pixelfusion, or let the plugin automically decide depending on the CPU speed and video resolution. 
  * Fully optimized code, utilizing MMX and SSE2 instruction sets where available. 

**What's New in version 1.60:**

  * Added support for Stream+ Technology, less digital artifacts with streaming video.
