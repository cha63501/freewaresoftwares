**Publisher's Description**  
  

DivXMediaBuilder is a smart and reliable program to create full featured DivX
files (create the final .divx file). It is a powerful tool to create DivX
movies with all the new features, menus - chapters - many audio/subtitles.

New DivX files act now as a container. Inside a DivX file we can have many
titles/movies, many menus (including language spesific menus), up to 8 audio
and 8 subtitle tracks for every title/movie, chapters for every title/movie.
So we can create menus and allow user to select language for the menus, select
audio or subtitle, select a chapter to start playing from.

A menu is an avi file/movie, most of the cases very small (about 5 secs). In
this avi file we can create buttons that have spesific actions (redirect to an
other menu, select an audio/subtitle, play a title/movie, ...).

The most important thing in a menu is the exitAction. exitAction means what to
do after a menu file is finished. Usually is "Play this menu again" and that
means that the menu file will start playing again. This is used in usuall
menus.

An other option is to play an other menu/file. This is used if the menu is an
intro for an other menu. So, like DVDs before let the user to select
something, first play an intro and after is the "real" menu where the user can
select something.

**Features:**

  * Support menus, chapters and other features of new DivX format 
  * Can create the final xml file that DivXMux needs. 
  * Also can create the menu files with buttons and overlays of user choice. There are some overlays that come with the program, but a user can create their own. Here is a tutorial about how to create your own overlays and how to name it.
