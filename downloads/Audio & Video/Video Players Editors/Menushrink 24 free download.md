**Publisher's Description**  
  

MenuShrink is a small application that lets you compress DVD motion menus by
turning them into still menus with or without audio. Best of all, is entirely
completely free!

Many DVDs use motion menus (i.e., animated menus where buttons appear in front
of a segment of video that usually loops). If youA're having problems
shrinking your DVD with DVD Shrink because itA's too big to begin with, this
tool might help you. It will turn your motion menus into still menus (where
the buttons are overlaid over a still image), with or without audio.

In many cases, the space savings is tremendous. For some of the Star Wars
movies (R1 versions), the main menus take nearly 800MB, and can easily be
shrunk to about 40MB (keeping the audio).
