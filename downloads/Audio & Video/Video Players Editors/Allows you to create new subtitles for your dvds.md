**Publisher's Description**  
  


SubtitleCreator allows you to create new subtitles for your DVDs. It has advanced synchronization features, DVD preview, and a simple WYSIWYG editor. Additionally, you can change the position and colors used by the DVDA's existing subtitles. 

**Features:**

  * Convert SubRib (*.srt) or MicroDVD (*.sub) files to IfoEdit (*.sup) files 
  * Load the corresponding IFO file (thanks to the SubRip sources), such that you can use the same color palette as used by the original subtitles 
  * Based on the IFO color palette, it tries to select white text, a black outline and a silver anti-alias color on a transparent gray background 
  * Based on the IFO file, it determines whether we are dealing with PAL or NTSC, and sets the subtitle window position appropriately 
  * Uses the line breaks you defined in the *.srt source, such that dialogs stay on different lines. However, the maximum number is defined by you, and if it doesnAt fit the window, the subtitles are joined and, if necessary, shrunken 
  * You can now also use _italic_, **bold**, or _underlined_ subtitles 
  * You can also use , and <s> for LARGE, large, and small text 
  * Preview and position your subtitles (using a screenshot as background) 
  * Deselect subtitles that you donAt want 
  * Automatically deselects credit lines (with @, or http) 
  * Choose the font that you like to use, and it's outline width 
  * Use profiles for default font and subtitle window position settings 
  * You can join several subtitle files, e.g. if the original subtitle consists of two parts 
  * Synchronize the subtitles using time shifting, frame rate conversion, or by watching the original DVD 
  * Synchronize the subtitles using the original subtitle *.sup file: by selecting a few matching subtitles in the text and original subtitle files, all subtitle start times are re-adjusted linearly. 
  * Stretch subtitles in horizontal and vertical direction 
  * Specify how many lines you wish to use for the subtitle 
  * Specify whether you want SC to automatically wrap lines 
  * Specify whether you want SC to generate bitmaps of the subtitles for you 
  * Specify whether you want SC to remove double spaces and other types of annoyances 
  * When opening a MicroDVDAs SUB file, special formatting commands are automatically recognized, like {Y:i}, {Y:b} and {Y:bi} 
  * You can define your own shortcuts in the configuration file, e.g. <s> gives you the music symbol 
  * You can search for a subtitle string.
