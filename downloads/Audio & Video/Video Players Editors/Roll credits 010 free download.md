**Publisher's Description**  
  

Roll Credits takes a still image and makes a scrolling credits AVI out of it,
by starting with all black and then scrolling the image from the bottom up at
the specified rate, until the bottom of the image has scrolled past the top of
the screen and then it stops.

Most movie editors make this way harder than it has to be, so I wrote this
utility to do the credits for a production I was involved in. I exported the
AVI to DVD and played it on the big screen.

The image is centered on the screen, the background is preset to black at the
moment. PAL and NTSC are the only supported output formats at the moment.
