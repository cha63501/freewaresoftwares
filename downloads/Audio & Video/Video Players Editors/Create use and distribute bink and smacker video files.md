**Publisher's Description**  
  


The RAD Video Tools are free for download! These tools include both of our popular codecs, Bink and Smacker. 

The RAD Video Tools give you everything you need to create, use, and distribute Bink and Smacker video files! They include the compressors, sound mixers, players, and general graphics and sound covnerters.

The Bink and Smacker players can be distributed free of charge, and a pop-up credit window will appear at closing. Or, you can license a non-logo/credit window version of our players as well.

The RAD Video Tools can even compile Bink or Smacker files into EXE files for self-running stand-alone videos (the player is bundled into the EXE file, so the user doesnA't need to download anything else!)

The RAD Video Tools run under Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, and XP. (They also include DOS and Windows 3.x versions of the Smacker player).
