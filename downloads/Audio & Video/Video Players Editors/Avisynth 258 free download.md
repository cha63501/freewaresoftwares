**Publisher's Description**  
  

AviSynth is a very powerful tool for video post-production. It provides almost
unlimited ways of editing and processing videos. AviSynth works as a
frameserver, providing instant and very fast editing without the need for
temporary files.

AviSynth itself does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) but instead
relies on a script system that allows advanced non-linear editing. While this
may at first seem tedious and unintuitive, it is remarkably powerful and is a
very good way to manage projects in a precise, consistent, and reproducible
manner.

Because text-based scripts are human readable, projects are inherently self-
documenting. The scripting language is simple yet powerful, and complex
filters can be created from basic operations to develop a sophisticated
palette of useful and unique effects.
