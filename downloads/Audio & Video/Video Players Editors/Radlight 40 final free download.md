**Publisher's Description**  
  

RadLight 4 is the first true multimedia player that allows you to fully
experience all kind of multimedia content such as DivX, DVD video or AAC/MP4
audio at highest quality possible on the PC. It is the only all-in-one
multimedia solution on the market to deliver all of this without being a
resource hog or being too complicated. In order to achieve the best user
experience and the smoothest playback we needed to take on a different aproach
when designing the new generation of RadLight.

RadLightA's unique modular architecture and its performance-driven component
management allow us to fully utilize the potential of modern PCA's while using
only limited amount of memory and CPU power. The new sophisticated
architecture makes RadLight not only very fast and stable but also highly
flexible & extensible via third-party plugins and modules. ItA's really easy
to extend RadLightA's functionality or to make it look completely different
when necessary.
