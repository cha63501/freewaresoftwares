**Publisher's Description**  
  


Taksi is a program that will allow you to take screenshots and record video clips of your favorite games and other 3D-graphics applications. Inspired by Fraps (www.fraps.com), Taksi aims to provide an open source alternative to that great tool. 

Other features:

Supports user-specified key mapping, allowing user to assign almost any key to a particular function (such as video start/stop, screenshot trigger, etc.). Runtime re-mapping of the keys is supported via GUI: user can change keys without having to restart the game.

Custom video settings are supported (see manual.txt for more details about this). Basically, this allows a user to specify on a per-game basis the frame rate of the captured video, and the weight of each source frame. The weight determines whether a particular frame is captured or not. This allows for creation of smoother and faster videos, when generic algorithm doesnA't produce desired results.

  * Supported OS: Win95/98/ME, WinNT4.0/2K/XP/23. 
  * 3D Graphics API: Direct3D 8, Direct3D 9, OpenGL 
  * Screenshot file format: 24-bit BMP 
  * Video file format: uncompressed AVI
