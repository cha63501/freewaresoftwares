**Publisher's Description**  
  

MPC-BE is a free media player based on the "Media Player Classic" project, but
it contains more features and bug fixes for an even better playing experience.
The player is compatible with many video and audio formats.

You can use it to play media from a wide variety of sources, including Blu-ray
discs, DVDs and the Internet. It plays nearly every media file without any
hitches, and you can add the files you like to AFavoritesA for easier access.
The player allows you to open existing subtitles and search for more online.
You may also download your subtitles database.

The player allows you to save images in different formats, including
thumbnails. You may choose the options you want to appear on the menu bar or
hide the bar. The play option lets you do a variety of things, including
viewing frame by frame, increasing or decreasing rate and choosing different
filters and shaders.

With MPC-BE, you can configure what you want to happen after playback,
including the possibility to shut down the computer.

MPC-BE requires at least the version of DirectX released in June 2010 to play
well.
