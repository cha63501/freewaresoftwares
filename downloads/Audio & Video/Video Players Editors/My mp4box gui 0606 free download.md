**Publisher's Description**  
  

My MP4Box GUI is a Graphical User Interface for the well-known command line
tool [MP4Box](http://www.freewarefiles.com/MP4Box_program_34369.html). My
MP4Box GUI, like MP4Box, is freeware. Meaning that it is complete and
functional software that does not require payment or other compensation (such
as nags or advertising) for its use.

MP4Box is an MP4 muxer. It can import MPEG-4 video (H.264 or ASP, encoded for
example with x264, DivX, Xvid, 3ivx or FFmpeg) and audio streams into the MP4
container. The end result is ISO compliant MP4 streams. It can also produce
MPEG-4 Timed Text streams by importing subtitles formats such as srt. It can
also split MP4 files into sections, which can be useful when transferring
files to portable media players. MP4Box is part of the GPAC Project framework.
It provides only a command line interface, and, for legal reasons, the author
only distributes its source code.

My MP4Box GUI makes using MP4Box much easier. Instead of having to type out
all the commands that you want MP4Box to do, My MP4Box GUI does all this for
you. So you only have to click a few buttons to get the job done; not type a
paragraph, to get the job done.
