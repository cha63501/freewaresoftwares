**Publisher's Description**  
  

A program which is capable of playing partially downloaded AVI movies. To make
it unique, it is capable of playing files which are in the stage of
downloading. I made it to be able to have a peek on AVI files I get from Kazaa
in real time without having to close Kazaa itself (way to often the name of
the file is quite different from what is inside!). Later on, the list of
supported programs will be extended.

**Features:**

  * Preview AVI, divX, MPG, MPEG and VideoCD files without interruption of the download process 
  * Uses standard DirectX framework - no additional software needed 
  * Very simple interface and tiny size (112KB) 
  * Does not change the original video file in any way 
  * Tested extensively with P2P and FTP software
