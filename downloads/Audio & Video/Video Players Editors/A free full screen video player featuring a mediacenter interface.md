If you like using VLC to play your media files, then we bet you will love JuceVLC, which combines the benefits of VLC and MediaCenter in one program. The free video player features a full-screen user interface that resembles that of MediaCenter, but it is relatively simple. On the other hand, you can use the program to play almost any media file type just as you can do with VLC media player. 

**Features:**

  * Adjusting settings via On Screen Display 
  * Browsing both local and remote files 
  * Selecting subtitles and synchronizing via O.S.D. using a slider 
  * Large, customizable fonts size 
  * Keeping positions of the last 30 videos in addition to favorite and last video folder 
  * Frontpage movies menu with customizable color theme 
  * Portable 

**Using JuceVLC**

The installer does not interfere with Windows registry because it stores settings in its own application folder. This means you can make subsequent installs without affecting the previous ones except in the creation of shortcuts.

We used the installer twice: the first time created a desktop shortcut to the player saved on our PC while the second time allowed us to place the player on a USB flash drive, which we could use on all our computers. All we had to do was select our preferred destination drives and folders.

The first time we launched JuceVLC, it displayed images corresponding to the drives and partitions connected to our computer. Hovering over an image displayed drive letters and names. However, we could change this by setting our preferred folder as frontpage.

The playerAs layout is ideal for large screens, from navigation to playing videos. For example, we changed the aspect ratio easily to ensure all videos we played fit the screen used depending on its size.

Right-clicking anywhere on the black interface displayed the programAs menu on the right part of the screen, and left-clicking on the interface hid the menu. There is a star icon on the left side of the slider on the lower part of the interface, which you can use to change what appears on the slider.

The player provides many options for adjusting videos and other features. For example, you can change the speed of play from 50% to 800% and add subtitles to videos by downloading them from the Internet. In addition, you can change the background color and opacity to allow you to see other applications or the background while using the player.

Since the video player is compatible with a wireless mouse, we could use our computer as a television as we were able to control it remotely even when sitting on a couch. 

**Conclusion**

JuceVLC is a free video player that provides a MediaCenter feel while remaining lightweight. It is compatible with all media types, including pictures, audio and video. Its portability means it does not tamper with Windows registry and allows you to enjoy it on multiple computers.
