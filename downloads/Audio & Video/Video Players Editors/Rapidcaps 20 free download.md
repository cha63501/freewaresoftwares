**Publisher's Description**  
  

RapidCaps is a freeware program that creates Video caps (sample pictures
called captures of a video) which give you a preview across the whole length
of the video. Unlike other programs which create the caps using a video on
your harddisk, RapidCaps creates caps directly from an internet url. This
means that you can see the sample caps of a video before actually downloading
it thus saving bandwidth, time and money.  
  
RapidCaps supports almost all video files and can work with sites on which you
have a premium account too. And, not only does it generate preview images, it
shows the complete video information too such as the duration and size of the
video.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
