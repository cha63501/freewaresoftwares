**Publisher's Description**  
  

The RAD Video Tools are free for download! These tools include both of our
popular codecs, Bink and Smacker.

The RAD Video Tools give you everything you need to create, use, and
distribute Bink and Smacker video files! They include the compressors, sound
mixers, players, and general graphics and sound covnerters.

The Bink and Smacker players can be distributed free of charge, and a pop-up
credit window will appear at closing. Or, you can license a non-logo/credit
window version of our players as well.

The RAD Video Tools can even compile Bink or Smacker files into EXE files for
self-running stand-alone videos (the player is bundled into the EXE file, so
the user doesnA't need to download anything else!)

The RAD Video Tools run under Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, and XP. (They also
include DOS and Windows 3.x versions of the Smacker player).
