**Publisher's Description**  
  

VirtualDub is a video capture / processing utility for 32-bit Windows
platforms, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It lacks the
editing power of a general-purpose editor such as Adobe Premiere, but is
streamlined for fast linear operations over video. It has batch-processing
capabilities for processing large numbers of files and can be extended with
third-party video filters. It is mainly geared toward processing AVI files,
although it can read MPEG-1 and also handle sets of BMP images.

**Features:**

  * Fractional frame rates. Don't settle for 29 or 30 when you want 29.97. 
  * Optimized disk access for more consistent hard disk usage. 
  * Create AVI2 (OpenDML) files to break the AVI 2GB barrier and multiple files to break the FAT32 4GB limit. 
  * Integrated volume meter and histogram for input level monitoring. 
  * Real-time downsizing, noise reduction, and field swapping. 
  * Verbose monitoring, including compression levels, CPU usage, and free disk space. 
  * Access hidden video formats your capture card may support but not have a setting for, such as 352x480. 
  * Keyboard and mouse shortcuts for faster operation. To capture, just hit F6. 
  * Clean interface layout: caption, menu bar, info panel, status bar. 
  * Reads and writes AVI2 (OpenDML) and multi-segment AVI clips. 
  * Integrated MPEG-1 and Motion-JPEG decoders. 
  * Remove and replace audio tracks without touching the video. 
  * Extensive video filter set, including blur, sharpen, emboss, smooth, 3x3 convolution, flip, resize rotate, brightness/contrast, levels, deinterlace, and threshold. 
  * Bilinear and bicubic resampling -- no blocky resizes or rotates here. 
  * Decompress and recompress both audio and video. 
  * Remove segments of a video clip and save the rest, without recompressing. 
  * Adjust frame rate, decimate frames, and 3:2 pulldown removal. 
  * Preview the results, with live audio. 
  * Open video file (Ctrl-O). 
  * Save AVI (F7).
