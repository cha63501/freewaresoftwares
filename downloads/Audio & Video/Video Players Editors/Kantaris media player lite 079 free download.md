Kantaris Media Player Lite aims to be an all-in-one media player that provides
a great audio and video experience. Video playback is based on Videolan Client
(VLC) code which results in that it plays everything without the need of
installing any codecs. Connects to an online subtitle database, finds
subtitles that are a perfect fit to the played media. Plays RAR-archives
without first extracting the media.

OpenCandy Adware. Both programs are very similar, with identical features and
appearance. What makes Kantaris Media Player Lite better is that it contains
no spyware, adware or advertising.
