**Publisher's Description**  
  

3nity Media Player is a highly portable multimedia player capable of reading
most audio and video formats (MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, DivX, MPEG-1, mp3, ogg,
aac ...) as well as DVDs, Audio CDs VCDs, and network streams.

3nity Media Player is a graphical user interface for mplayer. ItA's based on
MPUI v1.2 by Martin Fiedler.

It can play any audio/video file that mplayer supports, thatA's about 99% of
all media files you can find.

It has all features of original MPUI:

  * Plays hundreds of different video and audio formats, including MPEG-1, -2 and -4 (DivX), H.264, MP3, Ogg Vorbis and AAC (More than 192 Video- und 85 Audiocodecs supported natively). For most media files, no additional codecs are needed (Binary Codec Package is already include).  

  * The most important MPlayer options (aspect ratio, deinterlacing, and postprocessing) can be configured without typing in cryptic command-line options. (But if you want or need some non-standard options, you can still add them by hand).  

  * Support for multiple audio and subtitle tracks on DVDs. Combines MPlayerA's cool keyboard navigation with a mouse-controlled seekbar.  

  * Plays files, network streams and discs (such as (S)VCD or DVD). Drag&Drop supported.  

  * Multilingual user interface : english , french , spanish.  

  * No installation is required to use MPUI/MPlayer. Simply copy the two .exe files into a directory of your choice an run MPUI.  

  * Using a special autorun.inf file, self-playing DivX CDs can be made. This adds only 3.5 MB to your CD, and on the computer playing the disc, no codecs need to be installed.  

**WhatA's New in version 3.0.0.3:**

  * corrected: a display bug with main program menu on windows xp and windows 7 (again, now itA's ok !) 
  * improved: Radio Names and Playing songs improved.
