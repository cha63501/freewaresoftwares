**Publisher's Description**  
  

cladDVD .NET is a DVD ripper that can pretty much rip any DVD just the way you
want it as it uses vStrip for the decryption. This means you can rip a single
file, complete title set or main movie as is, or, even better, initiate IFO
Parsing (default) and rip the exact selected ProGram Chain (PGC). It includes
all the extended options like A'Multi-AnglesA', detection of A'Mastering
ErrorsA', A'MacroVisionA' removal, A'Key-SearchA' intensities and A'Audio
StreamA' re-mapping. It also includes a A'FrameServeA' option giving direct
control and execution of the DVD2AVI program (included) to aid in the process
of converting to Video-CD by creating the A'D2VA' and A'WAVA' file.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
nloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows
XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
