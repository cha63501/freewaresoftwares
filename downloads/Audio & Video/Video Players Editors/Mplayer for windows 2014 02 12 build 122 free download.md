**2\. Acknowledgment**

MPlayer was created by The MPlayer Project http://www.mplayerhq.hu/>. This
package contains software by Ricardo Villalba and Martin J. Fiedler. Special
thanks to Gianluigi Tiesi for the Win32 builds of MPlayer.

MPlayer for Windows is free software. DonA't pay to download or use it! We are
NOT affiliated with any third-party sites offering payed downloads. You may
consider [donating](http://mplayerhq.hu/design7/donations.html) to the MPlayer
Project though.

**Anti-Virus Warning**

Occasionally your Antivirus program may mistakenly detect "malware" (virus,
trojan, worm, etc.) in some of the files here. This is called a "false-
positive" and the files are actually innocent/clean. ItA's an error in your
specific Antivirus software.

In case you encounter such problems, goto http://www.virustotal.com/ and check
the file again with multiple Antivirus engines! And take care with results
like "suspicious" , "generic" or "packed". Those are *not* real hits, they are
just wild speculation.

Apparently Antivirus programs tend to suspect installers/uninstaller created
with NSIS. Furthermore some Antivirus programs blindly suspect all UPXA'd
(packed) executables of being malware. Obviously this is a stupid
generalization, so please ignore those warnings!

Last but not least: Always keep in mind that this is OpenSource software! If
you donA't trust the people providing the pre-compiled binaries, download the
source codes and compile them yourself.

DONA'T SUBMIT ANY VIRUS/TROJAN REPORTS, UNLESS YOU HAVE VERIFIED THE INFECTION
WITH MULTIPLE ANTIVIRUS ENGNINES. THANKS!
