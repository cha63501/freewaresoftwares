**Publisher's Description**  
  


FLV Player is based on Flash Player 8 and utilizes the default Macromedia FLV Playback component, which uses a slightly customised skin (blue instead of green highlights). FLV Player is built with Screenweaver Open Source, which is still in beta, so your mileage may vary. Let me know if you encounter unexpected results. Or, even better, join the Screenweaver Open Souce initiative and help us create an even better version of Screenweaver! 

One often requested feature that hasnAt been incorporated yet is the AfullscreenA option, Partly because I need some additional time to work on that specific ability, partly because IAm not sure if itAs that usefull. Playing FLVAs fullscreen is very CPU intensive. I think the zoom 2x feature and the resizeable window will suffice for now, but if youAd really like a fullscreen option, drop me line in the comments.

An important note to keep in mind: FLV Player uses the Macromedia Flash 8 FLV Playback component to play .flv files with. This component functions best when your .flv contains valid metadata. All .flv files created with recent encoders such as Macromedia Flash 8 Video Encoder have their metadata injected automatically. However, if you wish to view older .flv files they may not contain up-to-date metadata. I highly recommend you use Buraks FLV Metadata Injector to automatically inject correct metadata into those files.

This program is the fruit of my spare time. This means there may be some glitches, rough edges and other minor and/or major annoyances you may discover. Please tell me about issues you encounter, so I can fix them and please understand that my time and attention isnAt dedicated 100% to maintaining and supporting this free, open source project. Feel free to download the source files and improve upon them. 

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes the Yahoo! toolbar which does not have to be installed to use the software.
