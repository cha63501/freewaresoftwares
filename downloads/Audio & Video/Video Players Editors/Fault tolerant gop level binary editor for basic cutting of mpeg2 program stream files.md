**Publisher's Description**  
  


Mpg2Cut2 is a unique open source Fault Tolerant, GOP level, binary editor for basic cutting of Mpeg2 Program Stream files. Handles very large files (64bit) captured from Digital Television broadcasts (DTV), including High Definiton (HDTV). 

**Features:**

  * Copies selected portions of an MPEG-2 Program Stream. 
  * Mpg2Cut2 can only edit Mpeg-2 or Mpeg-1 - NOT Mpeg-4. Mpeg-1 is only partially supported. 
  * If you have a transport stream, then it is preferable to convert it to a Program Stream using PVAStrumento. 
  * Ability to correct a small range of errors in the program stream, such as missing headers or incorrect aspect ratio. 
  * User tailorable reminder messages. 
  * The basic approach is to mark the "FROM" and "TO" points of the clip that you want to keep, and then save that selection to a new file. Repeat this for each clip that you want. 
  * If you are working with Digital Television files, run each of the saved clips through a correction program, such as ProjectX or PVAStrumento. 
  * Drag and Drop the resulting clips into your DVD Authoring package. This way each clip becomes a separate scene, with itA's own thumbnail on the DVD menu. 
  * (Your DVD Authoring package may be different to this.) 
  * Mpg2Cut2 is essentially a GOP level editor. A GOP is a "Group Of Pictures", which is usually around 13 frames, lasting around half a second when played. 
  * This typically corresponds to the minimum playable Video "Sequence". 
  * Selection is generally made at the GOP level, so accuracy is typically limited to about half a second of time, in the typical situation of "SEQ/GOP/KEY-FRAME/DELTA-FRAMES". 
  * The program allows for Sequences that do not have a GOP header, but the sequence must at least begin with a key frame.
