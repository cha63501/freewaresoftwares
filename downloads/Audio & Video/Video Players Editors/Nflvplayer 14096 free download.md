**Publisher's Description**  
  

This player offers common video player functionality and even an OSD display
:). ItA's built around macromedia flash ActiveX control and that control does
play the video so compliance is 100% :).

Note that FlashVideo is generally very CPU consuming so heavy bitrate video
might need faster CPU accordingly.

**What's New in version 1.4.0.96:**

UPDATE v 1.4 nFLVPlayer now supports native flash fullscreen. There is a new
mini player controls panel with autohide capability for the fullscreen mode.

There are also video file metadata display and a new video aspect ratio
correction feature. You can see information about the video file including
video/audio codec and bitrate, framerate etc. The amount of information
available depends on how complete is the information within the video file.
FLV metadata can be injected with a third party tool like flvtool.

The new aspect ratio correction feature allows you to explicitly set a video
to 4:3 or 16:9 or to fill the screen up to 4:3 or 16:9 by cutting from the
sides allowing to fill a screen in the desired proportions without distorting
the image.

Also nFLVPlayer now uses a different format and no external .swf file is
needed anymore.
