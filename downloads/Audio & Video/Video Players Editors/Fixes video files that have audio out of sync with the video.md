Video Audio Sync Fixer fixes video files that have audio out of sync with the video. Sometimes during a conversion to another video file format, the audio and video will not remain in sync and this software can be used to adjust them. 

Video Audio Sync Fixer can work with a 1 minute clip instead of the whole video to find the correct adjustment time. Once you have the video file fixed the way you like, you can apply the settings to the whole video.
