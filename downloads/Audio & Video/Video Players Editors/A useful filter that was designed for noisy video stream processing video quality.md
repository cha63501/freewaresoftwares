VirtualDub MSU Denoising Filter (Noise Removal) is a free and useful filter that was designed for noisy video stream processing, video quality improvement, or video preprocessing (e.g. for preprocessing before compression or deinterlacing). 

The filter suppresses noise in both spatial and temporal domains. Filter effect is specified for each type of denoising in the dialogue box as shown. Checkboxes help to set required combination of domains, thus enabling spatial-only or temporal-only denoising.
