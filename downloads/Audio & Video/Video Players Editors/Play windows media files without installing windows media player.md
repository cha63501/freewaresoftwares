**Publisher's Description**  
  


Some tools (like nLite and XPlite) allow you to remove Windows Media Player from your system or even prevent it from ever being installed. The downside to this is that vital components for Windows Media playback are also removed. As a result you wonA't be able to play Windows Media files in your browser or in your favorite player. A solution for this problem is Windows Media Lite, which restores those vital components. This package can also be used to install the Windows Media codecs.
