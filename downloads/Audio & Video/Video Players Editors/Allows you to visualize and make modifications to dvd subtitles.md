**Publisher's Description**  
  


DVDSubEdit allows you to visualize and make modifications to the subpics (subtitles or button highlights in menus) directly inside the VOB files, without the need to demux and remux the subpic stream. 

**Features:**

  * Drag/drop one or several vob files, the analysis is done in the background. You can start looking at the SPUs right away. 
  * Displays the subpics along with the background video, reading the Color Lookup Table from the IFO. 
  * You can move the subpicture up and down and see the result right away. 
  * You can select subpictures by stream ID (language) or by Vob/Cell IDs and only move the selected subpictures. 
  * When youA're satisfied with what you see, simply click "Save all changes". Saving takes a few seconds, and you can test your modification in your favorite software player. 

**What's New in version 1.51:**

  * Added retiming for sup files. 
  * Added code to check that the auto clut does not have two identical colors, and abort editing with external tool if it does. 
  * Added "invert selection" button. 
  * Added proper handling of "Delete" key in OCR edit box. 
  * Removed annoying warning about using autoclut when modifying subpics with external tools and colors are ambiguous, and you're already using autoclut. 
  * Added option in preference to disable "CLUT warning" during bitmap export/import operations, when the bitmap only uses 3 colors. 
  * Added an option in preferences to show the absolute PTS time, or the PTS relative to the first VOBU. It is customary in SUP file to display the PTS relative to the first VOBU. However, in many cases, the absolute PTS reflects the real display time of the subtitle in the movie. 
  * Added shortcut Ctrl-Shift-E to edit bitmap with external tool. 
  * Changed the default AutoClut colors so no two colors are identical. 
  * Made a change to fix problems arising with PAL subpics in NTSC video. 
  * Adjusted the area cut when removing words from subtitles. 
  * The play buttons are now disabled when loading a sup file. 
  * Sup files were sometimes created with a read-only flag. This is now fixed. 
  * Fixed a bug that could cause a crash in some cases (e.g., only changing force-start to normal-start) when saving. 
  * Fixed a problem that could cause DVDSE to hang when opening very short VOB files. 
  * Fixed a problem with how buttons were displayed when not selected and not activated. 
  * Fixed a few problems with start and end x/y values when exporting/importing bitmaps. 
  * The user manual has been updated for this version.
