**2\. Acknowledgment**

MPlayer was created by The MPlayer Project http://www.mplayerhq.hu/>. This package contains software by Ricardo Villalba and Martin J. Fiedler. Special thanks to Gianluigi Tiesi for the Win32 builds of MPlayer.

MPlayer for Windows is free software. DonA't pay to download or use it! We are NOT affiliated with any third-party sites offering payed downloads. You may consider [donating](http://mplayerhq.hu/design7/donations.html) to the MPlayer Project though.

**Anti-Virus Warning**

Occasionally your Antivirus program may mistakenly detect "malware" (virus, trojan, worm, etc.) in some of the files here. This is called a "false-positive" and the files are actually innocent/clean. ItA's an error in your specific Antivirus software.

In case you encounter such problems, goto http://www.virustotal.com/ and check the file again with multiple Antivirus engines! And take care with results like "suspicious" , "generic" or "packed". Those are *not* real hits, they are just wild speculation.

Apparently Antivirus programs tend to suspect installers/uninstaller created with NSIS. Furthermore some Antivirus programs blindly suspect all UPXA'd (packed) executables of being malware. Obviously this is a stupid generalization, so please ignore those warnings!

Last but not least: Always keep in mind that this is OpenSource software! If you donA't trust the people providing the pre-compiled binaries, download the source codes and compile them yourself.

DONA'T SUBMIT ANY VIRUS/TROJAN REPORTS, UNLESS YOU HAVE VERIFIED THE INFECTION WITH MULTIPLE ANTIVIRUS ENGNINES. THANKS!
