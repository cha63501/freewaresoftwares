**Publisher's Description**  
  

Area61 VideoBrowser is a multimedia player that plays back MPEG/AVI/WMV/RM
files in normal/fast/slow/frame-by-frame/repeat-loop playing modes. You can
also get shapshot images of any size from a movie file. Every frame of the
selected portion of the movie file can be converted to JPG/PNG/BMP images. On
the thumbnail view, you can browser an outline of the movie by browsing a
number of thumbnails taken from the movie file, and start playing the movie by
clicking the thumbnails.

Furthermore, the software allows you to seek a movie file by specifying
timecode. Datecodes (recording date and time) are extracted from DV-captured
AVI files, and displayed on the main panel. The software also supports audio
and image files.
