**Publisher's Description**  
  


Area61 VideoBrowser is a multimedia player that plays back MPEG/AVI/WMV/RM files in normal/fast/slow/frame-by-frame/repeat-loop playing modes. You can also get shapshot images of any size from a movie file. Every frame of the selected portion of the movie file can be converted to JPG/PNG/BMP images. On the thumbnail view, you can browser an outline of the movie by browsing a number of thumbnails taken from the movie file, and start playing the movie by clicking the thumbnails. 

Furthermore, the software allows you to seek a movie file by specifying timecode. Datecodes (recording date and time) are extracted from DV-captured AVI files, and displayed on the main panel. The software also supports audio and image files.
