**Publisher's Description**  
  


Moyea FLV Player is a free application for playback and control single FLV files from your desktop as well as from the Internet. 

Moyea FLV Player can be used standalone, without the need of the flash authoring tool, allowing you to show and preview your FLVs in a more controlled way with ease and to a broader audience than with Quicktime, Windows Media and Real Media, etc.

Standard playback controls are included in Moyea FLV Player and the program can be optionally associated with .flv files, so you can just double-click them to play.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
