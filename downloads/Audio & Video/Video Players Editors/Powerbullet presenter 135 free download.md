**Publisher's Description**  
  

Powerbullet Presenter is a small, simple and free program for creating
presentations in the FlashA format. You donA't need any experience to create
slick animated presentations by simply typing, clicking and dragging.

Powerbullet Presenter is specifically designed for creating multi-page
presentations that are commonly used in electronic sales brochures and
catalogues, splash screens, slideshows and student projects.

You can also create a self-running show, specifying delays on each page, or
you can link the timing to the sound attached to each page.

Your presentations can be exported as an HTML page with an embedded SWF
(Flash) file or as an executeable file which you can run on any Windows PC.
