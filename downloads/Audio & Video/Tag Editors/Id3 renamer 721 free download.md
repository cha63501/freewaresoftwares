**Publisher's Description**  
  

Useful if you need to rename a large number of files in a directory
accordingly to their ID3 description and a given "formula" (e.g. (%Track)
%Artist - %Title). Such a function is pretty "smart", as it lets you assembly
the filename as you wish and use the variables from the ID3 tag in the
filename. It is required you mark them with a "%" at the beginning, followed
by an ID3 section label (literally - i.e. the first letter is capital, exactly
as it is referred to in the roll-down menu).

Do you have loads of MP3 files in a directory and need to write a single
common piece of information into them (e.g. the interpret or the album name)?
You can type it in there manually, but this wonA't make you very cheerful if
the amount of files is large. Using ID3 renamer, everything is a matter of a
few mouse clicks.

Do you need to clean some portion of the ID3 tag? Use ID3 renamer and donA't
erase like every single line. Do you need to remove the diacritics? Choose the
advanced options and itA's already done. ID3 renamer can also create a new tag
if there is none in the file yet; it lets you easily write into new files too.

You can also fill the tag with information from the filename (alike the
renaming process). Just type in the pattern, definition of information layout
in the filename and ID3 tag version - and ID3 renamer will store everything.
The pattern is given in the form of a regular expression. ID3 renamer fully
supports ID3v1, ID3v1.1, ID3v1.1+Winamp extension and ID3v2.x.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
