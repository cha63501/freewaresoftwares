**Publisher's Description**  
  

Mp3dings is a small, powerful and easy-to-use program allowing you to change
the names and edit the meta-information of a large number of mp3 files at the
same time. Thus, you can use it to

  * transfer information from filenames to ID3 tags and vice versa 
  * consistently name and/or tag your mp3 files 
  * reorganize the directory structure of your mp3 collection 
Programs with similar scope usually lack the ability to process a large number
of ID3 tags at the same time. Mp3dings is written in Java and can thus be used
on every platform for which there is a Java Runtime Environment.
