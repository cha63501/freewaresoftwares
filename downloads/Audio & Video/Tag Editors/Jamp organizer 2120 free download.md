**Publisher's Description**  
  

With JaMP Organizer you can edit and delete audio file tags and fix audio file
filenames. ItA's actually two programs in one and you can easily switch your
music files between the two.

JaMP Organizer is not meant to create everything that tags can have. You can
create only the most common tag frames such as Artist, Title, Album etc. But
if you only need the most common tag frames then you should give JaMP
Organizer a try.

And of course what comes to renaming music files that is what JaMP Organizer
does best. With JaMP Organizer you can fix the filenames even if the files
donA't have proper tags. And if proper tags are present then you can deside
what portions of the tags you want to include in the filenames and which
order.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
