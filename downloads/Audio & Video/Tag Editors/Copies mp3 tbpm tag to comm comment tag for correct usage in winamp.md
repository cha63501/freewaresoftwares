This software is freeware for all usage. 

You can download freely the MixMeister BPM Analyzer from www.mixmeister.com. This program can make automata BPM values in the MP3 TBPM tag. This tag is the correct value for some audio players (ex: iTunes), but Winamp does not use this. This BPM2COMM application copies this TBPM tag information into the COMM (comment) tag. These tags are in use with the Winamp Media Library list (if you select this comment to visible) ...and you can use this BPM values for correct simple song mixing.

Please quit from BPM2COMM after the conversion before you use the changed mp3 files! See the LOG.LOG file in the program directory for running information.
