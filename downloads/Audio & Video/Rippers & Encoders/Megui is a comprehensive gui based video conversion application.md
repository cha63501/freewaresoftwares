MeGUI is a video conversion application, which was primarily designed to be a DVD ripper, but is capable of many transcoding tasks. It is essentially a frontend for many free tools, but also includes a number of utilities to enhance the conversion process. MeGUI is a free program which has many ties with doom9.org 

MeGUI is the most comprehensive GUI based ISO MPEG-4 solution. It supports MPEG-4 ASP (XviD & libavcodec MPEG-4) using mencoder, MPEG-4 AVC (x264) using x264.exe or mencoder, (HE)AAC audio using BeSweet & Nero AAC encoder and MP4 muxing using mp4box.

**Features:**

  * Powerful job queue support, with in-place job editing, related job linking, play/pause controls, etc. 
    * Parallel job execution makes job processing very flexible and improves speed on multi-core systems. 
  * Automatic interlace detection can analyse your input video to determine whether it is progressive/interlaced/film/hybrid, and also determine field order. 
  * AutoUpdate keeps MeGUI and its assisting programs up-to-date and eases installation. 
  * Audio encoding also based on Avisynth, which allows highly accurate editing of audio, including sample-accurate audio cutting.
