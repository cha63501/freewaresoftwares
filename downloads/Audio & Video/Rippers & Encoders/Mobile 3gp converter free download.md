**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Mobile 3GP converter is using "3GPtoRawAVI" converter to convert 3GP files
(3rd Generation Partnership Project, *.3gp) to uncompressed AVI files (*.avi)
in a user-friendly way. The 3GP video files must have audio in order to be
converted. The program offers two modes, one for single file conversion and a
second for multiple files conversion for converting many 3GP files at once. In
a single file conversion you have the option to convert only the audio, only
the video or both. The 3GP file format is being used by the majority of modern
mobile phones that have the ability to capture video.
