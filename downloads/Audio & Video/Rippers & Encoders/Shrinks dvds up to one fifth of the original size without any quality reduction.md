**Publisher's Description**  
  


AmoK DVD Shrinker shrinks DVDs up to one fifth of the original size without any noticeable quality reduction. Due to the smaller file size the copy can be burned on a "normal" 2.5 or 4.7 DVD-R. The DVDA's menus, subtitles, audio tracks etc all stay preserved. Though, if you want only the original film can be be copied/ripped. 

AmoK DVD Shrinker uses an open source DLL (ShrinkTO5), which offers excellent quality with high speed. The GUI is easy to use but offers all necessary options. Please note: AmoK DVD Shrinker cannot burn DVDs. AmoK DVD Shrinker only shrinks the DVD and optionally creates an ISO image.

Some DVDs are protected from copying. At least in Germany it is prohibited to actively remove a copy protection. Therefore, AmoK DVD Shrinker offers no functionality to directly rip a copy protected DVD (DeCSS). On the other hand, AmoK DVD Shrinker supports the popular and freely available Machinist2.dll. Please find out for yourself if it is legal in your country to download and use the Machinist2.dll.
