**Publisher's Description**  
  

AudioCrusher is a program which allows you to extract digital audio from audio
CDs and save the audio data in various sound formats such as MP3 and WAV for
example. The audio is extracted digitally without any loss of quality.
AudioCrusher supports on the fly normalization and a wide range of sound
formats such as RAW Audio, WAV, MP3 via LameEnc, BladeEnc or the Frauenhofer
Codec, AAC (via the faac encoder), Ogg Vorbis, MonkeyA's Audio Lossless
Compression and Windows Media Audio. More formats are available through the
Audio Compression Manager or the Command Line Encoder interface.

The cdparanoia error correction mechanisms make it possible to create bit-
exact copies of the audio data even from scratched CDs or CD drives which are
prone to frame jitter. AudioCrusher can get information on audio CDs through
the freedb database and is able to create SFV-checksum files of the converted
files to ensure file validity later on. AudioCrusher gives the user full
control over the ID3 tags which will be appended to the created MP3 files and
can create WinAmp play lists with extended play list information. AudioCrusher
is highly configurable while it is still small and very easy to use. And best
of all: AudioCrusher is completely free!
