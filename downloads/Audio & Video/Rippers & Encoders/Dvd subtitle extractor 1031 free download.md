**Publisher's Description**  
  

Converts subtitles from DVDs and PGS (Bluray .sup) files into Advanced
Substation Alpha text format using a simple OCR.

This app was created to extract subs from (non-encrypted, on hard drive) DVDs
and convert to Advanced Substation Alpha format. It can also convert sup (PGS)
and sub/idx formats to same.

ItA's a wizard-style app, allowing you to pick program chains, angles, audio
and subtitle tracks from a DVD folder and create mpg, d2v and bin (my own data
format similar to sub/idx combined) files for each. DGIndex is used to help
line up the subs to the video since DVD programs often have discontinuities
that mess up sync.

The OCR is pretty basic, just exact pattern matching of the characters. The
starting OCR database is pretty good though so most DVDs should require manual
matching of just a few characters. Some characters like l, I, 1, o must be
manually matched for every DVD since they have a lot of false positives.

The line and word layout functions are pretty sophisticated and should give
good results unless the characters are very unusual (vertical or upside-down
text is bad).
