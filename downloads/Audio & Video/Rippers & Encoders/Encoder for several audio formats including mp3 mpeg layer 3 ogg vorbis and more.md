**Publisher's Description**  
  


winLAME is an encoder for several audio formats, including mp3 (MPEG Layer 3), Ogg Vorbis and more. winLAME lets you set up the encoding process with an easy-to-use wizard-style user interface. 

winLAME supports many input audio formats, and uses the LAME mp3 coding library for encoding and the MAD decoding library for decoding.

Note that personal and/or commercial use of compiled versions of the LAME encoding engine (including the DLL distributed with winLAME) requires a patent license in some countries. Check before using winLAME!

More documentation can be found in the winLAME HTML Help File that was installed along with winLAME (only in the full installer).
