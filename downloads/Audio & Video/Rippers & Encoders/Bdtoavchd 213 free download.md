**Publisher's Description**  
  

BDtoAVCHD is a tool to create AVCHD discs from Blu-Ray or HD MKV files. As
output we get the folder structure ready to burn to a DVD5 or DVD9. The
software compresses the video to achieve the desired overall size of 4.7 GB or
8.5 GB with the highest possible quality.

The AVCHD format allows playback the same type of content that a Blu-Ray and
holding high definition (1080p) but on DVD5 or DVD9 media. It is ideal for
backing up Blu-Ray with much smaller size and maintaining high quality.

BDtoAVCHD is created with the idea that is very simple and quick to use and
obtain the best possible quality in a DVD5 media. To achieve this avoids
unnecessary conversions and do not need any codec installed as avisynth,
ffdshow or Haali media splitter. The recorded discs obtained are compatible
with almost any Blu-Ray player and PS3.

Also can convert Blu-Ray to MKV, MKV to AVCHD and Blu-Ray 3D to AVCHD/MKV 3D
side-by-side/top-bottom.
