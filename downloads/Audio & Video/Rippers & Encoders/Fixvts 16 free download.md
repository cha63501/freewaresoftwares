**Publisher's Description**  
  

FixVTS is a very tiny tool that allows you to adjust your DVD files into
better DVD compliance, so they can be opened in DVDShrink or vobblanker.

FixVTS does a similar job as whatA's called an "IFOEdit Mock Strip", but only
adjust as little information as possible in the VOB and IFO files to allow
opening in other apps while keeping the DVD as similar as the original as
possible.

You would use FixVTS if you messed up your DVD, for example by applying the
wrong tool, or aborting in the middle of some processing, and the result can
no longer be used.

Another good use is for DVDs that have been authored with errors in the IFO or
VOB files, such that they still play on your player, but wonA't open in DVD
editing tools such as DVDShrink, vobblanker and others. Yet another use is
fixing DVDs created by DVD-VR.
