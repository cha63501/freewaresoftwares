**Publisher's Description**  
  

Audiograbber copies music from CDs or external sources such as radios,
cassettes, or turntables. The music is saved on your hard disk as WAV, MP3,
WMA, or OGG files. Audiograbber has all the common features of CD-ripper
programs, such as normalizing, encoding of external files, track-name
downloading and uploading from and to FreeDB, and support for ID3 tags and CD
Text.

The line-in-sampling function can automatically split recordings from LPs into
separate tracks and use a noise-reduction plug-in from Algorithmix. It also
can schedule recordings if you, for example, want to record a radio show when
youA're not home. Audiograbber is multilingual; the most common languages are
included in the setup file, and others can be downloaded from the home page.
The latest version adds a function to better deal with copy-protected CDs.
Also new is built-in OGG support, and the program now can rip karaoke (CDG)
discs.
