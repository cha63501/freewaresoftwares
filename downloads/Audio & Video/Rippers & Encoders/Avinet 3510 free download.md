**Publisher's Description**  
  

The avi.NET application will allow you to load in both MPEG-1 (VCD) and MPEG-2
(SVCD/DVD/HDTV) movie files and convert them to an AVI. Whether it be a DivX
AVI, or XviD AVI, the resulting video file will be 100% standalone player
compatible.

It should play in your home dvd avi player just fine. avi.NET is FREE and all
external programs and/or filters are included in package.

Using avi.NET is simple, select 'IN' and load in your movie (MPG|VOB) file. If
it's the first time the movie has been loaded in, the file will 'INDEX'
(process will take a couple of minutes) and once completed you'll notice many
options have automatically been set and the movie is playing. avi.NET will, by
default, guess the required conversion size based on what you have loaded in,
whether that be a MPG|VOB clip or a full movie.

The basis of this 'size guess' lies with the bits per pixel calculation and
size will be determined at around 0.20 bits/pixel. This bits/pixel calculation
(now refered to as quality factor [QF]) is just a starting point. One movie
converted at a QF of 0.20 which looks great may not yield the same results on
another movie, all movies are different, and there have been many debates on
this but I use it because it give you a place to start. 'OUT' selects the
destination folder/name of your converted file, by default the file will have
the same name and be in the same folder as the input file.

'ADD' puts the conversion into the job list awaiting conversion. 'LOAD|SAVE'
refer to the job list. Once any jobs are awaiting conversion the 'START'
button will become enabled. One quick word about the input files... If your
source is a DVD which has numerous files as part of the movie, example:
VTS_01_1.VOB, VTS_01_2.VOB, VTS_01_3.VOB, VTS_01_4.VOB, don't load each file
in! You only need to load in the first, all the other files as part of that
set will automatically be processed. So remember, only load in the first file,
the one that ends with _1.VOB.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
