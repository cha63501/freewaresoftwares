**Publisher's Description**  
  


A simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the x264 codec, a new codec suited for the high definition. With this program you can encode a video from an avisynth script. You can select the settings of the codec or use a pre-set profile. 

This program supports: job queue, 10-bit depth, profiles, zones and audio. Please install [AviSynth](http://www.freewarefiles.com/AviSynth-RC_program_19362.html) for an optimal use!

Remember that this program is a video encoder, not an audio encoder, so the output file is a video without the audio. In a second moment you must demux the audio from the original video and remux it( eventually coded with an audio codec) in the new video.

**Features:**

  * support for profiles. Each profile consists of the command line, created following the guide of the codec. 
  * support for zones(since 0.7). Now you can use the zones(useful in some scene, like op/ed. 
  * support for the job queues. When the queue is over you can set an operation, for example turn off the pc. 
  * a menu, AtoolA where you can set a program that you want to execute simply by clicking on the menu item. For example a demuxer/muxer for a specific container. 
  * support for 10bit depth codec by using the avc_profile high10.(since 0.8) 
  * support for saving/restoring the queue to/from a file.(since 0.8) 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-3-Redistributable_program_21373.html) or higher (3.5 or 4.0). 

**WhatA's New in version 0.9.4:**

  * added a first version of the updater (0.1 beta 1) 
  * upgraded the codec to rev 2200 by JEEB (8 and 10 bit)
