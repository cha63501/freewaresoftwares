**Publisher's Description**  
  

WavPack allows you to losslessly compress (and restore) both 16 and 24-bit
audio files in the .WAV format. Unlike "lossy" compression schemes (like MP3)
that discard information, WavPack converts the audio data into a more compact
form so that the restored files are digitally identical to the original
source. ItA's somewhat like the file compression portion of WinZIP except that
because WinZIP is designed for other types of files, it works very poorly on
audio data. Like other lossless compression schemes the data reduction varies
with the source, but it is generally between 25% and 50% for typical popular
music and somewhat better than that for classical music and other sources with
greater dynamic range.

**WhatA's New in version 4.70.0:**

  * Easily transcode from WavPack to WavPack with a single command (including tag copy) 
  * Option to automatically verify every WavPack file when created 
  * All new plugin for Adobe Audition CS5.5, CS6, and CC
