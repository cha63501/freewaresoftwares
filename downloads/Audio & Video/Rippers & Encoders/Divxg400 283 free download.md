**Publisher's Description**  
  

DivXG400 was first brought to live to work around incompatibility with DivX,
MS MPEG4, WM7, WM8 codecs and Matrox G400/G450 drivers/hardware.

If image width of the clips is not exact multiple of 32 (like 720x???), clip
may be played back without using video overlay. Without video overlay, clips
are looking choppy and DVDMax can not be used.DivXG400 is a tool that extract
multiple clips.

**Features:**

  * Image adjustment (Pan & Scan, aspect ratio correction, overscan compensation) 
  * High quality subtitle display in windowed and full-screen mode. DivXG400 supports almost every known subtitle format: SubViewer 1.0, 2.0, SubRip, MicroDVD, SAMI, Sub Station Alpha 3.0, 4.0, JACOsub, DVDSubtitle, VobSub 3.0 ... 7.0, TMPlayer, SMIL-RealText, AqTitle. Additionally, MicroDVD INI-files are accepted as a wrappers to real subtitle files. 
  * Subtitle output to TV in DVDMax mode (of course, all "classical" modes are supported, too) 
  * Near to 24fps clip playback at 25fps . 
DivXG400 is codec-independent and should work within all players that use
automatic DirectShow Filter Graph generation (Windows Media Player, MicroDVD
Player, Zoom Player etc.). Also, video codec must support YUY2 output format.
