**Publisher's Description**  
  


RipIt4Me is a freeware utility that helps you backup your copy protected DVDs. 

Recently released DVDs are now very often equipped with stronger copy protections - such as ARccOSA and RipGuard DVD. Programs like DVD Shrink or DVD Decrypter cannot handle these types of discs.

With the help of RipIt4Me, ripping these DVDs will be a very easy task. The program is fully automated and the wizard will guide you through all the necessary steps involved. If you prefer, there is also a true "1-Click" mode that will perform all the involved steps automatically for you.
