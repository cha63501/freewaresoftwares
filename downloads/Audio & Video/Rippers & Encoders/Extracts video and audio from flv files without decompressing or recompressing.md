**Publisher's Description**  
  


Extracts video and audio from FLV files without decompressing or recompressing. The video is saved to AVI (H.263/FLV1 and VP6/FLV4 are supported) and the audio is saved to MP3. 

**NOTE:** The AVIs will not play unless you have the right decoders. [ffdshow-tryouts](http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/) can decode both FLV1 and FLV4 (VP6F), make sure theyA're enabled in the configuration dialog.

**NOTE:** The extracted MP3s may appear to have an incorrect duration in your audio player. This is because FLV Extract doesn't generate a VBR header, but the files are perfectly valid nonetheless. To add a VBR header you can load an MP3 in [foobar2000](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Foobar2000_program_13807.html), right click on it, go to Utils, and click "Fix VBR MP3 Header".

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html). 

**WhatA's New in version 1.6.1:**

  * Fixed 0-byte output for CBR MP3 audio less than 64KB. 
  * Detects MP4 files and recommends YAMB/MP4Box. 
  * Work around auto scaling bug in .NET Framework for high DPI compatibility.
