**Publisher's Description**  
  


Album Cover Art Downloader will semi-automatically download album cover images for your music collection. All you have to do is point it at the root of your music directory and for each directory, the program will download a set of corresponding (well, best guess) album covers from the Internet, from which you can choose one that suits your fancy. Currently supported image providers: 

  * Yahoo! Images 
  * Wal-Mart 
  * Buy.com 
The following programs make use of the cover images: 
  * KDE, GNOME and others that follow the FreeDesktop.org .desktop-entry spec 
  * Windows XP Explorer 
  * Windows Media Player 9+ 
  * CDcover, an XMMS plugin 
  * CoverViewer, another XMMS plugin. 
  * wmalbum, a WindowMaker dock applet 
  * Various WinAMP plugins, for example Cover TAG. 
In addition, some portable music players can show the cover image if it is embedded in the MP3 file.
