CdCoverCreator is a powerful tool to create your own CD covers for both Audio
and Data CDs. Use CdCoverCreator to create your covers, inlays, labels, and
even booklets.

**Features:**

  * Design time for your inlay is held as short as possible: The Creation Wizard can read the track lengths of an Audio CD, get album information over the internet (CDDB), read CD-Text, or create a directory structure for Data CDs. 
  * Use "Match & Merge" for own Audio CD compilations for which CDDB is not available. 
  * Export the track listing as formatted text via the Windows clipboard into your word processor or save the track listing as HTML. 
  * Many pre-defined style templates available that define the coverA's basic layout. 
  * Download CD covers from the web directly in CdCoverCreator using the integrated Cover Browser. 
  * Scan your CD covers to duplicate directly in CdCoverCreator. 
  * Create your own CD booklets. Easily compile the lyrics for your CD with the integrated Lyrics Browser. 
  * CdCoverCreator can create covers for Jewel Cases, Slim Cases, or (cut-out) paper sleeves.
