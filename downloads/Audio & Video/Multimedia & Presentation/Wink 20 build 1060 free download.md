**Publisher's Description**  
  

Wink is a Tutorial and Presentation creation software, primarily aimed at
creating tutorials on how to use software (like a tutor for MS-Word/Excel
etc). Using Wink you can capture screenshots, add explanations boxes, buttons,
titles etc and generate a highly effective tutorial for your users.

This is a good example of how you can create tutorials in Wink, by capturing
screenshots, mouse movements and specifying your own explanations with them.
And all this in a standard Windows-based UI with drag-and-drop editing makes
it very easy to create high quality tutorials/documentation.

It is estimated that Macromedia Flash Player is installed in more than 90% of
the PCs. Using Wink you can create content viewable across the web in all
these usersA' desktops. Similar applications sell for hundreds of dollars,
while Wink is free with unrivaled features. So spread the word about Wink to
your friends.
