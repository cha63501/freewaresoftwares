**Publisher's Description**  
  


caotica2 is a "noise design application", featuring audio synthesis and effects. File format is the standard WAVE. 

The goal of this experimentally designed application is to generate new sounds and noises, and also to alter wave files using simple and complex mathematical effects.

The results may sound "noisy" and chaotic and, actually, they are, although rather predictible when getting used to the application. caotica2 is a source of A<> for the use of experimental composers.
