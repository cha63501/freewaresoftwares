**Publisher's Description**  
  

MythTV based on Ubuntu with XBMC added. Basically it is a fully setup Linux
system with all of the necessary script changes and sudoers authorities
completed. So with minimal setup requirements the user will have an excellent
HTPC based on the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS base.

This setup works particularly well, with exceptional picture quality and is
probably the ultimate MythTV .21 setup. Being based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS allows
upgrading, except for MythTV .21, unless a later version is required, and
installing other software.

**Fixed sound problem and went back to ALSA Sound Package 1.0.24-2 which means the Graphic Equalizer is now working. Instead of croaking like a frog, this OS now sings like a bird. Although, it was working fine on the machine on which it was originally compiled.**

Go to, <http://www.eeemc.com/>, for all of the necessary installation
information.

**Note:** This download is an .iso file which needs to be burned to DVD.
