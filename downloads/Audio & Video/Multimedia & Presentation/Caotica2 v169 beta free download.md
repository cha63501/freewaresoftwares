**Publisher's Description**  
  

caotica2 is a "noise design application", featuring audio synthesis and
effects. File format is the standard WAVE.

The goal of this experimentally designed application is to generate new sounds
and noises, and also to alter wave files using simple and complex mathematical
effects.

The results may sound "noisy" and chaotic and, actually, they are, although
rather predictible when getting used to the application. caotica2 is a source
of A<> for the use of experimental composers.
