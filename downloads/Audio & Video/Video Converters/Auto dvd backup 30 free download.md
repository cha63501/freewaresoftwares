**Publisher's Description**  
  

This is a very easy to use DVD to XviD program. Most of the original DVD
content can be compressed (main video, multiple audio streams, subtitles,
chapter menu) and the result (ready to be burned on CD-R or DVD-R) can be
played back with any Windows PC equipped with the XviD codec (for video
playback), the Ogg Vorbis DirectShow filters (for audio playback - optional)
and VobSub for DirectShow (for subtitles playback - optional).

DVDA's video is converted from MPEG2 to MPEG4 (with XviD Twopass encoding),
DVDA's audio is converted from AC3 to OGG and DVDA's subtitles are RARed.

In order to offer, among with video, multiple audio streams, chapters, etc.
ADB sets up BSPlayer, which supports all these neat functions, for playback.

**Requirements:**

  * [XviD video codec](http://www.freewarefiles.com/cat_6_210_Codecs.html) (required) 
  * [AviSynth](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_6_74_19362.html) (required) 
  * The DirectShow Ogg Vorbis filter collection (optional, for OGG audio) 
  * [VobSub](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_6_210_22507.html) (optional, for subtitles)
