**Publisher's Description**  
  


FFCoder is a .NET based audio/video converter, which is capable of transcoding audio and video files to various formats. It is a unified frontend for many freeware utilities such as FFmpeg, MPlayer and MEncoder. 

**Features:**

  * Supports 16 command line encoders : ffmpeg, mencoder, ffmpeg2theora, x264, xvid_encraw, avs2avi, lame, faac, Nero AAC, OggEnc, FLAC, MonkeyAs Audio, OptimFROG, Speex, MusePack and WavPack. 
  * Batch processing. 
  * Parallel processing (multiple files can be transcoded at same time). 
  * Advanced configuration options for all codecs. 
  * Supports 2-pass encoding with automated first pass. 
  * Encode video using vfw codecs such as VP6, VP7 and FFDShow (by using avs2avi). 
  * MeGUI presets can be imported for x264 and xvid encoding. 
  * Support for video filters provided by the encoder (such as mencoderAs filters) 
  * Input files can be avisynth scripts or any format supported by ffmpeg. 
  * For encoders such as x264_cli which support very few input formats, the video is decoded with ffmpeg and then piped to the encoder, on-the-fly. 
  * Tools: Dump audio/video stream to file, create images in JPEG/BMP/PNG/TIFF format, rebuild/cut/join video files, quantization matrix editor, etc. 

**System Requirements:**

  * [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html)
