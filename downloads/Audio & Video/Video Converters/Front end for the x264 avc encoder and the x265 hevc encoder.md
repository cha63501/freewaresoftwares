**Publisher's Description**  
  


This application is a lightweight GUI front-end for the x264 H.264/AVC as well as the x265 H.265/HEVC encoder, based on the Qt toolkit. 

Some key features of the Simple x264/x265 Launcher software include:

  * Support for creating H.264/AVC (x264) and H.265/HEVC (x265) files 
  * Fully self-contained, *no* additional Codecs or PluginA's are required 
  * 64-Bit as well as 32-Bit encoder binaries are fully supported 
  * Optionally the "high bit-depth" encoder variants can be selected 
  * Batch encoding (job control) support is implemented 
  * If desired, multiple encoding jobs can be executed concurrently 
  * Adding new jobs via command-line interface is supported 
  * Input from the Avisynth *and* VapurSynth frame servers is supported 
  * 32-Bit Avisynth/VapourSynth can be mixed with 64-Bit x264/x265 
  * Straightforward encoder setup thanks to the Preset and Tuning system 
  * Custom encoder parameters can be added, if desired 
  * Easily manage your encoder configurations with user-defined templates 
  * Consistent "look & feel" on all systems thanks to the Qt toolkit

**System Requirements:**

  * Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or any later Windows system 
  * 64-Bit Windows is highly recommended (32-Bit Windows works as well) 
  * The CPU must support at least the MMX and SSE instruction sets 
  * Avisynth input only available with Avisynth 2.5+ installed 
  * VapourSynth input only available with VapourSynth R19+ installed 
  * YV16/YV24 color spaces require Avisynth 2.6 (see section 10) 

Simple x264 Launcher is 100% standalone, i.e. it does *not* require Mircrosoft.NET, Java Runtime Environment or other dependencies.

The required Qt DLLs and encoder binaries are included in the setup.
