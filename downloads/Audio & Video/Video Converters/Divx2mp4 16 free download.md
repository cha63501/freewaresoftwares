Small utility for converting AVI-files of a format MPEG4, compressed Microsoft
MPEG4 codec in a format DivX or Angel Potion and back, XviD to DivX 4&5 and
back. When converting AVI-files only the heading is replaced without any
changes data.

Depending on what you want to receive at compression of a video (better image
or smaller size), you can for one fragments of film use one codec (DivX Low
Motion), and for others (DivX Fast Motion). Use DivX2Mp4 for pasting these two
files into one file.

opportunity of recording and playing of AVI-files compressed as compared to
previous versions in which it is blocked. Mediaplayer reports - "unidentified
error" and refuses to play a file.

DivX codec or you can play them with DivX codec.
