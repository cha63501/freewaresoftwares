authorPOINT Lite is a freeware PowerPoint presentation tool, which converts
PowerPoint to Flash. authorPOINT Lite can be used for converting presentations
to Flash for offline use, and to upload to authorSTREAM or WiZiQ for free
online presentation sharing options.

authorPOINT Lite - the free PowerPoint to Flash converter has a simple and
very usable interface, which enables you to quickly convert PowerPoint
