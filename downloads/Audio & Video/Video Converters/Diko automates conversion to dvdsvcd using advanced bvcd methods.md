**Publisher's Description**  
  


DIKO is an automation tool to convert video to DVD and SVCD, allowing to reach up to 6 hours in 1 DVD-R or 2 hours in 1 SVCD. 

For each step of this conversion, thereA's an optimal way to do it and a optimal software (generally freeware) to use. But using all softwares and learning each step to do an optimal conversion is a time consuming task in two aspects: you have to spend a lot of time learning to use the tools and you have to be around to run each tool.
