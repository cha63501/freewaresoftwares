**Publisher's Description**  
  


_Pazera WebM Converter_ is a free program that allows you to convert almost any audio and video file to WebM format. Video files created by the program are compatible with **HTML5**, so you can use them on your websites. 

The video stream in the input file is encoded using **VP8** encoder, and audio stream with **Vorbis** encoder. The application supports multi-threaded encoding, which greatly speeds up the conversion process. In addition, the program supports two-pass encoding, which provides high image quality and reduces the size of the output file. 

Basic operation of the program is very simple: just _drag & drop_ video files into main window, select the _Default encoder settings_ in the Profile list and click the CONVERT button.  
More advanced users can customize many video and audio encoding parameters: audio and video bitrate, VBR or CBR video encoding mode, minimum & maximum quantizer, aspect ratio, fps, resolution, audio sampling frequency, volume, keyframe interval, brightness, saturation, time range and other.

  * A number of predefined conversion profiles. Possibility to save your own settings to an INI file.
  * A large number of encoding parameters: audio and video bitrate, VBR or CBR video encoding mode, CRF - constant quality mode, display aspect ratio, frames per second (fps), number of audio channels, audio sampling, volume, changing the resolution, scaling and cropping the image, deinterlacing, color conversion to grayscale or sepia, brightness, saturation, horizontal & vertical flip, rotation, keyframe interval (GOP size), quality/speed ratio modifier, VP8 profile and other.
  * Support for 2-pass encoding which provides high image quality and reduces the size of the output file.
  * The ability to save encoder commands to BAT file.
  * The program is **portable**: it does not use system registry and all settings are stored in INI files. Thanks to this program can be run from portable devices such as pendrives, removable drives.
