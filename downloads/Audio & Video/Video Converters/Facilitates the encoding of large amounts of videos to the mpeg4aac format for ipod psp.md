**Publisher's Description**  
  


MpegALot has one purpose - to facilitate the encoding of large amounts of videos to the MPEG4+AAC format (for ipod, PSP, etc). 

It has several useful features that greatly simplify this task:

  * Clean, unified, streamlined GUI that handles all the various "behind-the-scenes" open-source command-line encoding apps 
  * Encoding frontend is completely multithreaded to take advantage of multicore/multiprocessor/hyperthreaded systems to greatly speed up batch encodes 
  * Accepts both files and folders as sources, and can apply custom filtering rules to specify only certain files/folders to encode 
  * Can recurse through source folders to encode all files in all subdirectories 
  * Output all encoded files to a single folder or to a directory relative to each sourceA's path 
  * Can preserve metadata from source to output files 
  * Multi-user aware, so multiple users can run different encoding jobs without interfering with each other 
  * AV presets and encoding jobs can be imported/exported as simple XML files for easy transfer between machines 
  * "Autorun" mode suitable for launching from the command-line or task scheduler 
  * Extensive logging mechanism and GUI for debugging errors and monitoring progress 
  * Able to encode almost any file that is playable in Windows Media Player 
  * And so on... 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
