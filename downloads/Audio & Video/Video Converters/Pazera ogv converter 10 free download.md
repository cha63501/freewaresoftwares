**Publisher's Description**  
  

_Pazera OGV Converter_ is a free application that allows you to convert almost
any audio and video file to OGV format. Video files created by the program are
compatible with **HTML5**, so you can use them on your websites.

The video stream in the input file is encoded using **Theora** encoder, and
audio stream with **Vorbis** encoder. The program supports two-pass encoding,
which provides high image quality and reduces the size of the output file.

Basic operation of the program is very simple: just _drag & drop_ video files
into main window, select the _Default encoder settings_ in the Profile list
and click the CONVERT button.  
More advanced users can customize many video and audio encoding parameters:
audio and video bitrate, display aspect ratio, frames per second, resolution,
audio sampling frequency, volume, keyframe interval, brightness, saturation,
time range and other.
