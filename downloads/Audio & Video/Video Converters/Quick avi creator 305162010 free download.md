**Publisher's Description**  
  

Quick AVI Creator (QAC) is a FREEWARE, easy to use front-end, which uses
several GNU licensed applications to convert DVD/video to AVI/xvid/x264.

The extra goal of the Quick AVI Creator is the absolute tuning of the output.
To accomplish this goal, QAC uses AvsP which is the main difference between
Quick AVI Creator and other video conversion front-ends.

Therefore you have the full control of the generated Avisynth script, thus you
take advantage of every feature that the Avisynth offers. You can preview the
output, resize, trim, deinterlace, if necessary, change frame rate, add
Avisynth filters like denoise, etc.

**System Requirements:**

Obviously a proper decoding filter for decompressing AVI, DivX, XviD, etc.
should be installed. If you havenA't already one, my suggestion is ffdshow.

In order to install and run Quick AVI Creator package in platform NT systems,
you must be logged in at least with a Power User account.

**What's New in version 3.5.16.2010:**

  * Added new feature: Support for FLV input source. QAC is now able, to transcode FLV sources (flv and f4v extensions) to AVI/MKV/MP4 containers. 
  * Added new feature: Support for Windows Media input source. QAC is now able, to transcode Windows Media sources (wmv and asf extensions) to AVI/MKV/MP4 containers. 
  * Added: FLVExtract CL v.1.6.0.0 (GNU-GPL). 
  * Updated: Mediainfo to version 0.7.26. 
  * Reverted: Valdec from version 0.31b to version 0.2a due to compatibility issues with faac. 
  * Please note that for a successful FLV source video conversion other than AVC video, the ffdshow filter must be installed and configured properly to handle those video formats. 
  * QAC successfully tested on both Windows 7 32 bit & 64 bit professional editions.
