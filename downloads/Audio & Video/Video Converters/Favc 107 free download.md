**Publisher's Description**  
  

FAVC is a GUI for several different free video tools. It takes one, or more,
avi/mov/wmv/asf/avs/vdr files and produces a dvd folder ready to be burned to
a dvd and played in any regular dvd player. I wrote this to save me doing all
the things manually. If itA's also helpful for you then thatA's great. This
wonA't get the best results possible, but itA'll do it fairly quickly.
