**Publisher's Description**  
  

CDG2Video will batch convert CDG+Mp3 files to any format. There are no known
audio/video sync issues.

This version supports mkv output. There is a lightweight version (half the
size) that does not support mkv on the website.

You can use the program to generate batch files to run yourself if required.

The cdg is converted in a 3 stage process and is quick.

  1. CDG video is made 
  2. Audio is converted 
  3. Video & Audio are remuxed into one file. 

**Requirements:**

  * [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html)
  * [VideoLan (1.11) (VLC)](http://www.freewarefiles.com/VLC-Media-Player-VideoLAN_program_13617.html)
Written and tested on Windows XP. Other windows versions will work, but either
need to be in 32bit compatability mode or have user permissions allow the
running of *.bat files.
