**Publisher's Description**  
  


A lot of 3D animation software can export video to sequenced images, where the transparency is stored in the alpha channel. Alpha channels are perfect for video compositing. Unfortunately not all video editors are able to import sequenced images with alpha transparency, and use them as a video sequence, so this is where Bojo Video Converter comes to the rescue... 

With Bojo Video Converter you can:

  * Import almost any type of image files. 
  * Convert the sequence of images to avi files, with or without compression. 
  * Split the output into one file containing the video and another containg a mask, based on the alpha channel. (see illustration above)
