**Publisher's Description**  
  

DIKO is an automation tool to convert video to DVD and SVCD, allowing to reach
up to 6 hours in 1 DVD-R or 2 hours in 1 SVCD.

For each step of this conversion, thereA's an optimal way to do it and a
optimal software (generally freeware) to use. But using all softwares and
learning each step to do an optimal conversion is a time consuming task in two
aspects: you have to spend a lot of time learning to use the tools and you
have to be around to run each tool.

DIKO is like a super speciallized robot that does the all the calculations,
decides what is best qualitywise and gives the right orders to all tools,
aiming to get excellent video quality. DIKO is 100% freeware, and everything
it needs is also freeware and bundled in the install package.
