**Publisher's Description**  
  

_Pazera Free MKV to AVI Converter_ is the freeware application that converts
Matroska video files (**MKV**) to **AVI** or **MPEG**.

MKV is an open standard of multimedia container that allows to embed multiple
audio tracks and subtitles in one file. For this reason it is very often used
to rip DVD and Blu-ray discs. Unfortunately, many players and video editing
programs do not support the MKV format. In this case, it is necessary to
convert MKV files to more popular format, such as AVI or MPG.

The program has a number of predefined settings (profiles) specially designed
for novice users. While more advanced users can customize video and audio
encoding parameters used by encoder: audio and video codec, audio and video
bitrate, audio track to convert, fps, sampling frequency, resolution, volume,
deinterlacing, and other.

The Pazera Free MKV to AVI Converter interface is a very simple and user-
friendly. To convert video files, just drag & drop them into main window and
click the _CONVERT_ button.
