**Publisher's Description**  
  

ISO Recorder is a tool (power toy) for Windows that allows (depending on the
Windows version) to burn CD and DVD images, copy disks, make images of the
existing data CDs and DVDs and create ISO images from a content of a disk
folder.

ISO Recorder has been conceived during Windows XP beta program, when Microsoft
for the first time started distributing new OS builds as ISO images. Even
though the new OS had CD-burning support (by Roxio), it did not have an
ability to record an image. ISO Recorder has filled this need and has been one
of the poular Windows downloads ever since.

With an advent of Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003 the version 2 of ISO
Recorder has been released, which intorduced some new new features including
ISO creation and support for non-admin user.

Finally, in Windows Vista it became possible to address another long-standing
request and provide DVD burning capability.

Since the very beginning ISO Recorder has been a free tool (for personal use).
