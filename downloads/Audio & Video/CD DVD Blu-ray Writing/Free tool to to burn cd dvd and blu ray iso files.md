**Publisher's Description**  
  


If you have ISO images you would like to burn but do not have the program used to author them, Active@ ISO Burner will come to your rescue. The simple utility uses the ISO 9660 standard to burn CD, DVD and Blu-ray ISO files, and it supports automated burning. You can use all types of discs to burn the files. 

The program provides a dialog-style interface that guides you throughout the burning process. Its simple user interface makes it easy even for beginners to burn ISO files within a few minutes. The burning process only requires you to enter the full path to the file to be burned or use the browse function to select it, insert a blank disk and wait for the program to detect it and then click the ABurnA button.

If you do not want to use the default burning options, you can configure Active@ ISO Burner to suit your preferences. You may choose among three burning modes: Disk-at-Once, Session-at-Once or Track-at-Once. You may also change the burning speed, specify the number of copies to burn and even erase a Read-Write (RW) disk.

Active@ ISO Burner provides a quick and simple way of burning ISO images that suits beginners well.
