**Publisher's Description**  
  

AmoK CD/DVD Burning is for all those people who think burning programs such as
Nero or WinOnCD are too overloaded with functionality that no one needs. AmoK
CD/DVD Burning does not have a media center, wave editor, cover designer and
cannot create videos. AmoK CD/DVD Burning burns CDs and DVDs and offers all
options you need A nor more and not less.

Multisession, file verification, RW Deletion, ISO, CUE and BIN burning, "On
the Fly" burning, Video CDs, Audio CDs, DVDVideo, Disc Caching and more is
offered by AmoK CD/DVD Burning. Supported are all available CD and DVD formats
such as CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM and DVD+DL. No
registry entries are created during the installation and AmoK CD/DVD Burning
runs from a USB Stick or a CD. A U3 Version is available, too.

In addition, AmoK CD/DVD Burning offers skin support and plug-ins expanding
the functionality.
