**Publisher's Description**  
  

ImgBurn is a lightweight CD / DVD / HD DVD / Blu-ray burning application that
everyone should have in their toolkit! All the latest drives are supported
(including booktype / bitsetting on many of the major ones). Advanced
functionality can be found in the ImgBurn context menus.

It has several 'Modes', each one for performing a different task:

  * Read - Read a disc to an image file 
  * Build - Create an image file from files on your computer or network - or you can write the files directly to a disc 
  * Write - Write an image file to a disc 
  * Verify - Check a disc is 100% readable. Optionally, you can also have ImgBurn compare it against a given image file to ensure the actual data is correct 
  * Discovery - Put your drive / media to the test! Used in combination with DVDInfoPro, you can check the quality of the burns your drive is producing 

ImgBurn supports a wide range of image file formats - including BIN, CUE, DI,
DVD, GI, IMG, ISO, MDS, NRG and PDI.

It supports Unicode folder/file names, so you shouldn't run in to any problems
if you're using an international character set.

ImgBurn supports all the Windows OS's - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT4, 2000, XP,
2003, Vista and 2008 (including all the 64-bit versions). If you use Wine, it
should also run on Linux and other x86-based Unixes.

It's a very flexible application with several advanced features that are often
lacking in other tools, especially when it comes to burning DVD Video discs.
It supports all the latest drives without the need for updates (including
booktype / bitsetting / advanced settings on many of the major ones - i.e.
BenQ, LiteOn, LG, NEC, Plextor, Samsung, Sony).

There is an image queue system for when you're burning several images (which
you can automatically share between multiple drives if you have more than one)
and an easy-to-use layer break selection screen for double layer DVD Video
jobs. The Automatic Write Speed feature allows you store your favourite burn
speed settings on a per 'Media ID' basis, right down to a drive by drive
level. Data captured during the burn (write speed, buffer levels etc) can be
displayed / analysed using DVDInfoPro.

Whilst ImgBurn is designed to work perfectly straight out of the box, advanced
users will appreciate just how configurable it is.
