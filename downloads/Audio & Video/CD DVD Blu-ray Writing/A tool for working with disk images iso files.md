**Publisher's Description**  
  


Saturn disk image is a tool for working with ISO 9660/Joliet disk images (.iso files). The toolkit consists of a program called Disk image creator, which can be used to create disk images using either a graphical user interface or a command-line interface, as well as a dotNET component for reading and writing disk images. The toolkit also integrates with the well-known NAnt build system, enabling software engineers to create disk images as part of their regular build scripts. 

**Features:**

**User interface:**

  * integrates with the well-known NAnt build system, enabling software engineers to create disk images as part of their regular build scripts. 
  * includes a command-line interface for automation. 
  * includes a graphical user interface for easy disk image creation. 
  * full source code available. 

**Code library:**

  * written in C# targeting the dotNET framework 2 platform. 
  * adheres to MicrosoftA's design guidelines for class library developers. 
  * covered by a comprehensive suite of automated unit tests. 
  * the binary distribution includes xml documentation, accessible through intellisense. 
  * full source code available. 

**Supported formats:**

  * supports level 1 interchange according to section 10.2 of the ISO 9660 specification. This means that file names are restricted to 8+3 characters, and that interleaved files or multi-disk volumes are not supported. 
  * supports the Joliet extension to ISO 9660. Joliet enables long file and directory names, the use of UNICODE characters, and removes the restriction on the depth of the directory tree. 

**Other:**

  * reliability ensured by a controlled build, test and release process. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.3.2.0:**

  * Automatic shortening of long paths for Joliet disk images. 
  * GUI responsiveness improved; now a progress window is displayed when a disk image is being written. 
  * Bug fixes.
