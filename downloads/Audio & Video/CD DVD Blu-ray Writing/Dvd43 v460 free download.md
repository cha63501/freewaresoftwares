DVD43 removes most copy protection found on movie DVDs.

How to use DVD43:

  * When your DVD reader is empty or the movie inserted is not copy protected, youA'll see a yellow smiley face. 
  * When a copy protected DVD is detected, the yellow face will turn to a red devil face for a few seconds and then to a green happy face - which means itA's ready to use. 

**What's New in version 4.6.0:**

  * Improved decrypting of newer DVDs with bad sectors.
