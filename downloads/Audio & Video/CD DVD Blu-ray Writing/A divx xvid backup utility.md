AutoGK (Auto Gordian Knot) is a DivX / XviD backup utility. With support of DVD sources and other MPEG2 sources (such as DVB captures and transport streams) encoding into your favorite MPEG4 format was never as easy as now.

  * fixed compatibility with non-english characters in the input path (excluding support of subs in this case) 
  * XviD now uses VAQ if source is not a cartoon (XviD setting in hidden options control's that) or have burnt-in subs. 
  * fixed bug with not all subtitles being processed if IFO file does not have them all in order (i.e. some are edited out) 
  * fixed bug with first subtitle track not being default one after rearranging order of subs 
  * included MPC that was missing from 2.50/52 installer 
  * fixed support of PCM audio tracks in MPG files
