**Publisher's Description**  
  


AmoK CD/DVD Burning is for all those people who think burning programs such as Nero or WinOnCD are too overloaded with functionality that no one needs. AmoK CD/DVD Burning does not have a media center, wave editor, cover designer and cannot create videos. AmoK CD/DVD Burning burns CDs and DVDs and offers all options you need A nor more and not less. 

Multisession, file verification, RW Deletion, ISO, CUE and BIN burning, "On the Fly" burning, Video CDs, Audio CDs, DVDVideo, Disc Caching and more is offered by AmoK CD/DVD Burning. Supported are all available CD and DVD formats such as CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM and DVD+DL. No registry entries are created during the installation and AmoK CD/DVD Burning runs from a USB Stick or a CD. A U3 Version is available, too.

In addition, AmoK CD/DVD Burning offers skin support and plug-ins expanding the functionality.

**Please Note:** AmoK CD/DVD Burning is the successor of "DP Simple Burn" aka "DP CD DVD Burner", developed by Dirk Paehl.
