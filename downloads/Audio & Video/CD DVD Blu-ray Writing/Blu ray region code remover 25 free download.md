**Publisher's Description**  
  

This program removes Blu-ray region code from Blu-ray rips on a hard disk
drive to allow playback regardless of region setting of the player.

In addition to Blu-ray region code removing functionality of "Blu-ray Disc
Ripper for .NET" this program supports removing of region code from Blu-ray
titles, which check the region of the player by means of BD-J script (e.g.
Fantastic Four 2, Sunshine).

Supports removing of region code from ALL current and future Blu-ray titles,
both with BDMV and BD-Java navigation.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-x-Final_program_16026.html).

**What's New in version 2.5:**

  * Fixed an error ("Extra data contains Zip64 information but version 2.0 is not high enough") which was happening when the program tried to process .jar files with Zip64 extentions. The error was caused by SharpZipLib.dll. Had to modify SharpZipLib's code and compile a custom .dll in order to fix this problem. 
  * Started using the same key and certificate for signing .jar files (previously the key was generated anew every time). This is also the same key and certificate used by AnyDVD HD for the purpose of .jar file signing (Thanks, Peer!). 
  * Added an option to fix downloaded BD-Live content in BD-Live cache folders. As the program uses the same key as AnyDVD HD for signing .jar files, you can use this feature for BD-Live enabled discs ripped or modified on-the-fly with AnyDVD HD (please refer to Fix_BD-Live.txt for more information). 
  * Minor user interface changes.
