**Publisher's Description**  
  

If you have ISO images you would like to burn but do not have the program used
to author them, Active@ ISO Burner will come to your rescue. The simple
utility uses the ISO 9660 standard to burn CD, DVD and Blu-ray ISO files, and
it supports automated burning. You can use all types of discs to burn the
files.

The program provides a dialog-style interface that guides you throughout the
burning process. Its simple user interface makes it easy even for beginners to
burn ISO files within a few minutes. The burning process only requires you to
enter the full path to the file to be burned or use the browse function to
select it, insert a blank disk and wait for the program to detect it and then
click the ABurnA button.

If you do not want to use the default burning options, you can configure
Active@ ISO Burner to suit your preferences. You may choose among three
burning modes: Disk-at-Once, Session-at-Once or Track-at-Once. You may also
change the burning speed, specify the number of copies to burn and even erase
a Read-Write (RW) disk.

Active@ ISO Burner provides a quick and simple way of burning ISO images that
suits beginners well.
