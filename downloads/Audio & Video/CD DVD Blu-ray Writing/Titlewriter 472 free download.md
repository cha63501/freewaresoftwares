**Publisher's Description**  
  

Titlewriter is a program used to Add/Edit DVD_TEXT, Menus (Either Simple or
Original) into Dvd Compilations.

DVD_TEXT - is used by higher end DVD Players and Jukeboxes to (Re)Create their
internal menus. This information added to a DVD (Only about 15% of Studios add
this information) will allow the user to avoid having to Hand Input
information into the Jukeboxes and allows the player to recover in the event
of Power failure (Common Occurance) or Moving DVDA's around internally in
player.

Many DVD Players will Display this information on their LED Displays or INFO
screen during Play. TitleWriter has a well-done user-friendly itnerface that
will ease a lot using the application itself.

**What's New in version 4.72:**

  * Major Bugfix: At some point I disabled the pgc fixes (Import Menu) for invalid title, stream calls Showed up during readding Orig menus for Doomsday and Never Back Down after DVDShrink Reauthor Me Very Very Bad -- Sorry This change will probably also decrease the amount of times Happyface is needed 
  * Added DVDTEXT -- Support (Via Settings) to create dummy entry for Actor name 
  * Added DVD_TEXT -- TW will import Actor name from database if dummy entry is present This works for Pioneer DVD Jukes -- You can select either Genre or Actor for "Second line" on Menu Untested on Sony Models (Pls Feedback) 
  * Bugfix? -- Added Scrollbar for Windows DPI setting > 96(default) (Make Menu & Simplify Menu Dialogs -- bottom of forms unreachable) 
  * Tweak -- Make Menu -- Setup Menu -- Currently Active Subtitle will now be shown as highlighted in menu
