**Publisher's Description**  
  

We wanted to create the most immediate, easily-accessible way to enjoy online
radio available, so weA've stripped everything back to the essentials. Nothing
gets in the way of the music - fire it up, choose a genre and dive in.

The player utilizes Radio TunaA's own algorithms to fingerprint and sort radio
stations by the genres of music that they play. This means we can separate
them into fine-grained genres such as Dub Techno, Lovers Rock and Chiptune in
a way that no other station index can. The app also displays relevant cover
art which is linked to Amazon, so you can buy the music that you like.

With an intuitive interface and effortless navigation, exploring the long tail
of radio has never been more enjoyable.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
