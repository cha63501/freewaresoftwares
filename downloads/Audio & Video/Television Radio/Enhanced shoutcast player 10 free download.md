**Publisher's Description**  
  

ESP is an Internet radio player which gives the listener access to thousands
of stations covering all genres over the ShoutCast network. Delivering
outstanding sound quality, ESP is very light and can even be run from a
Flash/USB drive.

Exclusively, ESP makes available for download, MP3A's that the currently
playing artist has uploaded to social-networking sites. No other player offers
this unique feature. So the next time you hear and artist or band who you
would like to hear more of, ESP will quickly search for MP3A's uploaded by
that artist to their official social networking sites and makes them available
for download.

In addition, the currently playing stream, can be ripped and recorded, saving
each track broadcast as a seperate MP3, with the artist and song title making
up the filename of the MP3.
