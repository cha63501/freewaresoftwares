**Publisher's Description**  
  


This small application brings you internet radio onto your desktop. After moving from Vista back to XP (my PC at least didnA't work well with Vista) I missed the radio player gadget that Vista provided, and I couldnA't find an internet radio player that I liked - ultra small and simple. So I made one! 

It doesnA't require installing either, making it hassle free. You can edit/add your own radio stations easily (read the readme) so youA're not stuck with my choices. It can be minimised to the System Tray to clear the desktop taskbar if you like it clean, and it obviously remembers what station you last had, what volume you had it on and where on the desktop it was, so you can make a shortcut and put it in startup for very simple net radio solution.
