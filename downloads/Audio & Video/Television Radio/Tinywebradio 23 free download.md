**Publisher's Description**  
  

A small and portable player for listening and recording webradio-streams. The
application is made as basic as possible so it should be self-explanatory.

**Some pointers...**

  * Right-click on a station in the preset-list to add it to the favorites 
  * Right-click on the filelist in "My Recordings" to bring up a menu 

**Supported input formats:** mp3, wma, asx, asf, ram, ogg, aac, m3u, pls

**Supported output formats:** mp3, ogg

Please note that even though "ram" is supported, Real Media is not! A
"ram"-file a playlist that can include mp3, wma or any of the other supported
formats and then it will work. If it includes a link to a "ra" or "rm"-file,
it wont work.

**What's New in version 2.3:**

  * TinyWebRadio will now let you know if there is an update availible 
  * Added a right-click menu to the preset-buttons so you can add the station playing to that button 
  * Added a function to check for new version 
  * Fixed a bug in the equalizer 
  * Fixed a bug in the volume bar, it sometimes got stuck at the top and bottom
