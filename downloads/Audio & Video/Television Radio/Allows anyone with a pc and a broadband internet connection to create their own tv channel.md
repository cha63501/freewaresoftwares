**Publisher's Description**  
  


TVUAs free Broadcast application is designed to allow anyone with a PC (Windows or Linux) and a broadband internet connection to create their own TV channel. TVUAs goal in releasing this software is to democratize broadcasting A enabling existing TV channels to find a global audience, and allowing you to create new channels that mirror your interests. 

Since a path from any broadcaster to any subscriber - broadband Internet - already exists, TVU networks wonA't have to build any intermediary infrastructure. Furthermore, TVU networksA' technology allows content providers to broadcast their programs with low-cost real-time servers and affordable (several megabits) Internet connections.

This dramatically reduces the network carrying cost in comparison to todayA's cable and satellite television services.

We hope that youAll create unique channels that are educational, cultural, and most of all, just plain fun. WeAd love to see surfing channels, high school sports channels, great webcams, and things we never even thought of.
