**Publisher's Description**  
  


DScaler (http://deinterlace.sourceforge.net/)is hands down THE best software to use for watching cable on your PC! IA've been using it for years and itA's FREE! Problem is, you canA't do timed recordings (time shifting) with it. ThatA's why I made DTVRecord! DTVRecord is a single exe. So you can put it anywhere! No other files are written to your hard drive. Only one entry (path to DScaler) is made to the system registry! 

DTVRecord does NOT actually do the recording. DScaler does that. DTVRecord basically starts up DScaler, changes it to your selected channel and starts recording. It then stops recording and shuts down DScaler at your selected stop time. Usage is pretty self explanatory. Enter channel, start and stop times, click "Start At". Thats it! Or Click "Start Now" to start recording immediately. In this case, you just set the end time. You can only set up a single recording session with DTVRecord. To get around this, just start up as many instances of DTVRecord that you need! ENJOY!
