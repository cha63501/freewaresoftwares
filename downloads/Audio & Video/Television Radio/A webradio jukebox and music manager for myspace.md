**Publisher's Description**  
  


Space Jammer is a crawler which shuffles through the artist-pages of MySpace and plays the music it finds there. 

You can create own playlists based on individual preferences for the music-search.

If you want to get more information about an artist or if you want to buy his record, you can vistit him at MySpace or start a search at Amazon, Musicload, Google, or Wikipedia.

Space Jammer is not a mp3-player!

ItA's a music-browser for MySpace. It grabs the urls of the players from the artistpages and loads them into a customized firefox-browser. Space Jammer itself doesnA't load or cache the music it plays. 

Space Jammer is freeware which means, it costs nothing. It also means that you are allowed to copy or send it for private use to your friends. 

**What's New in version 1.8.1:**

  * update to changes in the url of the MySpace player
