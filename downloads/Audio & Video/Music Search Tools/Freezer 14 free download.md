**Publisher's Description**  
  

Freezer is a free program that allows you to download music from sites like
deezer or jiwa.fm. It has been built as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that
whatever effort is made to prevent songs downloading, those sites are still
very unsecure concerning the way musics are diffused. The poc will probably be
extended to more sites, as it is based upon an inherant flaw they all have in
their streaming scheme.

The program filters/parse every http data which circulates between your
browser and the remote website. When a song from deezer or jiwa is detected,
it shows a dialog box asking to save the music. Then it saves the stream into
a temporary file which is decoded when the download finishes.

**WhatA's New in version 1.4:**

  * fixed bugs when downloading on deezer.now 
  * works with imeem too.
