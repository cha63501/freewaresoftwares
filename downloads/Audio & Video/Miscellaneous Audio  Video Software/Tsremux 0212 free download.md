**Publisher's Description**  
  

A transport stream re-muxer similar in functionality to EvoDemux.

**Features:**

  * Removal of source packet header 
  * Generation of source packet header 
  * Regeneration of DTCP descriptor (all others are kept) which removes analog output restrictions (downrezzing of HD, macrovision etc.) 
  * PAT/PMT generation for RAW TS files sourced from Sat/Cable/OTA 
  * Async I/O for maximum throughput 
  * Ability to trim streams at the beginning and/or the end 
  * Ability to pick and choose elementary streams to be kept 
  * Ability to remux PCR-less streams 
  * Ability to remux program streams (MPG/VOB/EVOB) into TS/M2TS 
  * Ability to demux elementary streams as well as subtitle streams compatible with SUPreader (right click the selected stream with the mouse) 
  * Fixing PCR/PTS/DTS after a file merge 
  * Removing end-of-stream markers for VC1 and AVC after a file merge 
  * Ability to inmux SUPreader presentation graphics subtile streams 
  * Ability to remux into simple Blu-Ray output (new) 
  * Ability to remux MKV into TS (alpha) 
  * Ability to extract Dolby Digital from TrueHD in Blu-Ray streams (new) 

**Notes:**

  * All PIDs are now forced to follow Blu-Ray PID requirements 
  * Still working on MKV support 
  * Blu-Ray output option is beta quality. 
  * Audio PES packets follow the blu-ray standard. (PES stream type 0xFD instead of 0xBD is incompatible with some older splitters/players) 
  * HD-DVD to Blu-Ray conversion might have issues due to incompatible DDPlus requirements. Combo-players will have better results than Blu-Ray only. 
  * MKV support early alpha quality. MPEG2/AC3 seems to work, others donA't.
