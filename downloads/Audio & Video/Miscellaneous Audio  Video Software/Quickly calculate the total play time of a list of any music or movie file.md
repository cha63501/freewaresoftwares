**Publisher's Description**  
  


Quickly calculate the total play time of a list of most any music or movie file. That was the original request. Due to further user requests, PlayTime has since been expanded to be a fairly complete front-end for the MediaInfo library. 

**Features:**

  * Drag & drop interface. 
  * Export all/selected rows to CSV file. 
  * Shell extension option. 
  * Total time is calculated as you add/remove files from the list. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.4.4:**

  * Double-clicking a row stopped working if there were too many items in the list.
