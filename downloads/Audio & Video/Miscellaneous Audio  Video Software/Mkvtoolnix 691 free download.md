**Publisher's Description**  
  

MKVToolnix is a set of tools that will help you create, alter and inspect
Matroska files under Linux, other Unices and Windows. They do for Matroska
what the OGMtools do for the OGM format and then some.

With these tools one can get information about (mkvinfo) Matroska files,
extract tracks/data from (mkvextract) Matroska files and create (mkvmerge)
Matroska files from other media files.

Matroska is a new multimedia file format aiming to become THE new container
format for the future. You can find more information about it and its
underlying technology, the Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML), at
<http://www.matroska.org/>

**WhatA's New in version 6.9.1:**

  * mkvmerge: bug fix: fixed huge memory usage when probing files it was reading the whole file into memory for that)
