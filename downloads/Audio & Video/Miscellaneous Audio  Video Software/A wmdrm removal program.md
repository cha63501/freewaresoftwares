**Publisher's Description**  
  


FairUse4WM is a WM/DRM removal program. ItA's a GUI version of drmdbg that supports individualization version .3930 and some Windows Media Player 11 versions. 

**Basic requirements**

  1. Only works on individualized DRM file 
  2. Requires Windows Media Player 10 or Windows Media Player 11. WonA't work on Windows Media Player 9. 
The programA's functioning can be verified with "Demo" DRM files from ezdrm.com, as well as those from other Microsoft Solution partners. 

This program is ONLY designed and intended to enable fair-use rights to PURCHASED media. 

  * While I havenA't been able to support license expiration/rental detection, please donA't use this to abuse rental license 
  * This code does NOT allow import of KID/SID pairs to preclude its use for piracy 

Note that some Windows Media Player installations will have multiple ECC key-pairs, so you will likely have to "Extract Keys" using multiple licensed files. If you find a file that doesnA't convert, try extracting keys wth it. Once your whole set of keys is extracted, you will no longer need to run WM per file.
