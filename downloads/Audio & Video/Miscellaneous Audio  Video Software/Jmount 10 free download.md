**Publisher's Description**  
  

JMount allows you to create virtual drives by mapping your favorite folder to
a drive letter. The virtual drive behaves as a real hard drive. It makes you
save time to browse for a folder with a long file path, and then provides you
prompt access to the folder. For example, the folder "C:\Documents and
Settings\All Users\Documents\" could be simply mapped to drive "Z:\".
