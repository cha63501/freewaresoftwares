**Publisher's Description**  
  


ScreenVideoPlayer is a simple utility which allows you to scroll through screencasts or screen capture videos and search the transcript of the video (only on videos whose transcripts have already been created). It is possible to create bookmarks of favorite locations in the video. 

I have had to spend a bunch of time watching screencasts to understand some Microsoft .NET technologies for my graduate assistantship work. So I decided to create an application which would make this process a little easier, as I was having to go back and forth watching these and using them later. Many times I would be scrambling around in the video wondering just WHERE that specific piece of code I am looking for was being discussed. :-) 

**System Requirements:**

  * [Windows Media Player 10 or above](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Windows-Media-Player-XP_program_11691.html)
  * [Microsoft .NET framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework_program_31320.html)
