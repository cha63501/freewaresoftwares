**Publisher's Description**  
  

GameEx is a graphical DirectX based front-end for MAME, Zinc, Daphne, PC
Games, and all command line based game emulators, along with being a complete
Home Theatre PC solution.

for playing games and for Arcade Cabinets although will run on Windows 98SE,

plug-in, GameEx still adds additional features including Internet Radio, News
Reader, DVDA's on disk, and Karaoke.
