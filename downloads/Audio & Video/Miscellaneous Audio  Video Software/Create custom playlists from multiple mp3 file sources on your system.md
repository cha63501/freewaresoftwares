**Publisher's Description**  
  


Random MixTape Maker allows you to create custom playlists from multiple mp3 file sources on your system. 

You can use these playlists to burn fresh, always new compilations to a CD or drag & drop to your portable mp3 player, or just save a playlist for your listening pleasure. You have complete control as to how the playlists are created. Controlling such things as song length, compilation size, compilation length, and files/directories you want to exclude allows you to custom tailor playlist creation to fit your needs.

Making "mix tapes" is as old an idea as the tape recorder itself; Random MixTape Maker was made to create a completely unique list of your favorite songs every time you use it, thus taking the hassle of searching through specific songs every time you want to make a mix of your own. Use it to make fresh mixes for your own listening pleasure, or use it to turn your friends on to your genre of music.
