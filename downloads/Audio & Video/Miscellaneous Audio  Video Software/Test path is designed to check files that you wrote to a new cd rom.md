**Publisher's Description**  
  


Test Path is designed to check files that you wrote to a new CD-ROM. Also, you can check any two paths (not only CD-ROM as destination). Easily verify that all files you wrote to CD-ROM exist and are error free. Test Path checks all files in the source path and its subdirectories and then compares them with files in the destination path and reports any differences in file data. 

Free for personal use.
