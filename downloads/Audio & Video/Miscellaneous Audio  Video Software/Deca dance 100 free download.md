Deca-dance is a program that acts as a hardware-replacement for a real-life
audio sampler/mixer. Essentially, the program lets you mix one or more
different sounds together. It mainly utilises both keyboard and mouse to allow
a standard computer to be able to mix. It has 10 channels, onto which a wav
file can be loaded and played. Each channel has individual controls for
volume, pitch, panning, looping, fade in/out, cue points, seek bar and more.
Please read the readme and the user manual before you use the program - visit
