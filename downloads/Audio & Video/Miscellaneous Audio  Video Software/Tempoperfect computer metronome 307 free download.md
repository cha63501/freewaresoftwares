**Publisher's Description**  
  

TempoPerfect is a Metronome that runs on your PC and can be controlled using
your mouse or hotkeys. Unlike mechanical metronomes that wind down,
TempoPerfect provides a clear and precise beat that can be accurately adjusted
for the correct bpm.

It features a visual beat indicator bar that bounces from left to right in
time with the beat. This provides musicians with a very helpful visual cue and
also includes a tempo guide in the main window.
