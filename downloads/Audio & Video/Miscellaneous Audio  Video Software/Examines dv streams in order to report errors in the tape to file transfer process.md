**Publisher's Description**  
  


DV Analyzer is a technical quality control and reporting tool that examines DV streams in order to report errors in the tape-to-file transfer process, such as video error concealment information, invalid audio samples, timecode inconsistency, inconsistent use of arbitrary bits in video DIF blocks, and DIF structural problems. 

DV Analyzer also reports on patterns within DV streams such as changes in DV time code, changes in recording date and time markers, first and last frame markers within individual recordings, and more.

DV Analyzer provides two primary services simultaneously:

  * Error Detection and Quality Control 
  * Temporal Metadata Reporting
