**Publisher's Description**  
  

Movie Thumbnailer (mtn) -- saves thumbnails (screenshots) of movie or video
files to jpeg files. It uses FFmpegA's libavcodec as its engine, so it
supports all popular codecs, e.g. divx h264 mpeg1 mpeg2 mp4 vc1 wmv xvid, and
formats, e.g. .3gp .avi .dat .mkv .wmv. mtn is open source software. It should
run on all operating systems which have gcc, FFmpeg, and GD, for example,
Linux and Windows.

**Features:**

  * Super fast! Thanks to FFmpegA's libavcodec. 
  * Command line program: can be used on remote connections to co-location servers, or used in scripts. 
  * Batch mode: recursively search directories for movie files. 
  * Run at lower priority (nice 10 on Linux, idle on Windows) by default. To run at normal priority use -n option. 
  * Thumbnails are group together in one jpeg file and can be saved individually too (-I option). 
  * Work fine with Unicode filenames in both Linux & Windows (might need to change the font with -f fontfile).
