**Publisher's Description**  
  


uWinamp is a add-on to Winamp, which detects when a new song loads to playback and then based on current track, forces a freeform skinnable alert to top right screen corner. 

This alert may be provided with current track title, artist, album, genre, comments, time, duration et cetera. Not only for notification purpose, you got a chanse to skip track, go to previous, increase/decrease volume, jump to file/time etc. depending on current skin.

This alert would pop up (or fade up if not freeformed) but it wins no focus. The program itself would never be revealed but will allways be avaible from the system tray (the icons near the system clock in the activityfield).

Rightclick on the NSS icon to reach all functions. Leftclick to skip to next track, control-klick to go to the previous. Why you should download? Free and offers extreme comfort!
