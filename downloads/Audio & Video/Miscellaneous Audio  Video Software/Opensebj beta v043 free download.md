**Publisher's Description**  
  

OpenSebJ is a free real time audio sample mixer that runs on Microsoft
Windows. The source code for OpenSebJ is released under the GNU General Public
License.

**Features:**

  * Supports loading of 255 Audio samples (wave format), which can be played in real time 
  * Sample properties such as, Volume, Pan and Frequency can be adjusted individually for each sample (even during mid play) 
  * A composition tool is provided, presented in a familiar multi-track sequencer environment. Looping compositions are also supported. 
  * Samples can be linked to keys on the keyboard and trigged in real time when a key press occurs 
  * Each sample can also have the play cursor position adjusted while the sample is playing, to provide a virtual needle to be moved 
  * Stream to disk recording, allows all audio played from OpenSebJ to be saved 
  * Pitch shifter roll, allows an order to be setup, so that each time a sample is played the next pitch shift in the sequence is undertaken before the sample is played. I.e. set up a sample to key A'1A', then setup a pitch shift sequence, high,mid,low,higher etc (using frequency values which are transposed to on screen A'rangesA' to allow easier utilisation) 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework
