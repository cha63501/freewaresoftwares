**Publisher's Description**  
  

As iTunes doesnA't provide a function to update/synchronize your music
collection with itA's own database, IA've written a small utility for that
purpose. Well, you may use A'Consolidate LibraryA' of iTunes, but this is a
typical MacA'ish behaviour letting one application control almost your whole
life. I donA't like that too much, so better let my app control your life...
:)

Even though I think that most severe bugs should be fixed by now, I still
recommend to backup your iTunes database (A'iTunes 4 Music Library.itlA' and
A'iTunes Music Library.xmlA') before playing around too much.
