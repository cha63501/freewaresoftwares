**Publisher's Description**  
  

Phase-Warper is a midi-controllable software synthesizer, the central sound
production algorithm of which distorts the phase of a sinusoid by a
2-dimensional vector p=(d,v) where d is the horizontal, and v the vertical
position of the bending point. As d and v are varied, a wide range of wave
shapes are produced, from narrow impulses to full cycle sinusoids. Certain
combinations of d and v produce formants centred around harmonics of the
fundamental, just like the human voice.

Unlike A'traditional subtractiveA' soft-synths (of which there is no shortage
of plugins or standalone applications), Phase-Warper features no wave shape
selectors or filters, because the synthesis technique it uses - which may be
called A'Vector Phase SynthesisA' - doesnA't require them.
