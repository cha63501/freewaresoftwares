**Publisher's Description**  
  

DVDFab Region Reset allows you to change region setting of popular Blu-ray
players (PowerDVD, WinDVD, TotalMedia Theatre) with a single click. It uses
the widely-known so-called region "hacks" for these players,applying them with
the bare minimum of user effort. This makes your playback software essentially
"region free" or more accurately "multi-region".

Whenever the tool sets a region, it also resets your "changes remaining"
counter in PowerDVD (5 changes for Ver.8 and newer; 65535 changes for
ver.7.3).

For PowerDVD & TotalMedia Theatre (TMT), you can set the region with just a
simple click on the "Reset" button.

For WinDVD, you have to restart PC in safe mode and start DVDFab Region Reset
to change the region.
