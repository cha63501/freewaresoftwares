**Publisher's Description**  
  


VolControl registers has two modes of operation: The default mode is to register three hotkey combinations with Windows which correspond to the volume up, volume down and Volume Mute commands. 

The second mode will usurp the volume control keys on many media keyboards to the same effect. This allows the user to more granularly control the volume settings.

VolControl is now portable! No installation required!
