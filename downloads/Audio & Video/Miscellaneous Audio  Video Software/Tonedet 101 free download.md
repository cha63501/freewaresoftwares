ToneDet is used to monitor an audio signal for a specific frequency tone or
multiple tones. Althrough it can detect any audio frequency, ToneDet is
usually used to detect very low frequency tones that cannot be heard by
humans.

Typical Applications include Radio Network Broadcasts (to automatically
trigger commercial breaks), Control Systems (To control remove systems over an
audio system), Remote Audio Switches (To switch signals on and off using
tones), Sub-band information transmission (To transmit information over an
audio transmission) and many more related applications.
