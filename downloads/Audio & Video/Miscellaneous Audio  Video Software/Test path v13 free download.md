**Publisher's Description**  
  

Test Path is designed to check files that you wrote to a new CD-ROM. Also, you
can check any two paths (not only CD-ROM as destination). Easily verify that
all files you wrote to CD-ROM exist and are error free. Test Path checks all
files in the source path and its subdirectories and then compares them with
files in the destination path and reports any differences in file data.

Free for personal use.
