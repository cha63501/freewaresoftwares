CD Splash is a very small but powerful application that will help you to create CD splashes. A splash is a window that is shown every time you put your CD into the CDROM unit. 

**You can customize the splash:**

  * to show your company logo, motto or signature 
  * to show a fortune cookie or disclaimer/legal agreement 
  * you can choose even to play your voice or movie 

**Which media types are supported?**  
CD, DVD, flash disks, floppies, virtually any device that can be set to auto-run when you mount it/insert it into the computer.

**Why to use it?**

  * Make your distribution media to look more appealing/professional 
  * Force your users to read the license agreement before using the material 
  * Ask the person who found the device to bring it back to you (this is very useful if you often forget your flash memory stick into userA's computer) 
  * Inform the users about who is the owner of the medium or the content contained on that medium 

**Features:**
