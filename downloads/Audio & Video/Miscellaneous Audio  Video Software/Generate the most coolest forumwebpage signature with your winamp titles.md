**Publisher's Description**  
  


Generate the most coolest forum/webpage signature with your winamp titles and include it in your forum profile or web page with a single line of code that will point to your custom signature image. 

After you register with us (on sig.iamntz.com ) you will receive by email a unique user ID and a URL to your image that you may use in your webpage/forums to insert the live image signature. This signature is generated with the LPS plugin that you must install in your media player (such as winamp). For now winamp is the only media player supported. Please download and install the winamp plug-in that is required for your signature generation from here or from sig.iamntz.com.

After you install it, access the plugin settings from winamp menu (LPS Settings..) or from winamp->prefs->general purpose and configure the account settings (with the user name and password created when you had signed up) then click on enable and you are ready to go! The image will be generated and stored on sig.iamntz.com The plugin has a preview build in: the preview will be updated only when the LPS settings window is active so change the song and wait a couple of seconds and you will see your live signature.
