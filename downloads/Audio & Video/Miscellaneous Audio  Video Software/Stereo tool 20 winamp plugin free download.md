**Publisher's Description**  
  

Stereo Tool is a **Winamp plugin** that can be used to manipulate sounds. It
contains a singleband compressor, an 8-band multiband compressor, a lowpass
filter and a stereo image manipulator.  
  
The _compressors_ can be used to make the playback volume and sound of
different recordings more equal, or to remove loud peaks from recordings.  
  
The _stereo image manipulator_ can be used to repair phase shift problems in
stereo recordings and to increase or decrease phasing and channel separation
separately. It can also be used to convert sounds from stereo to mono, while
preserving the fullness of the sound.  
  
The _lowpass filter_ is useful if certain frequencies need to be filtered out,
for example the FM stereo pilot tone at 19 kHz if you send the Winamp output
to an FM transmitter.
