**Publisher's Description**  
  

CD-Text is an extension of the audio CD-standard that allows you to store
additional information on an audio CD, such as album name, album artist and
track info. Many audio players like Winamp and RealPlayer can read CD-Text but
Windows Media Player never supported it. Until now, because WMPCDText will
read CD-Text directly from within Windows Media Player.

There is an option to automatically read CD-Text from unknown audio CDA's.
Alternatively, you can also right-click on a CD-track in the Now Playing-pane
while the CD is playing, and click "Read CD-Text" (see screenshot below).

WMPCDText especially comes in handy when using Windows Media Player for
playing home-made audio CDA's. Before WMPCDText, you would have to insert all
the track information of such a CD manually into Windows Media Player. Now,
just make sure that the CD-Text information is burned onto the CD, play the
burned CD with Windows Media Player, and WMPCDText will automatically read the
track information from the CD itself and insert it into the Media Library.

The plug-in is written for Windows Media Player 10 and higher. For reading CD-
Text on Windows XP and 2003, administrator rights are required. However, you
can use Nero BurnRights to make it work without administrator rights too.

**WhatA's New in version 1.2:**

  * Fully compatible with Windows Media Player 12 on Window 7: 
    * The "Read CD-Text" menu item is shown in the Play List pane on the right, both in Library and Now Playing mode. 
    * Removed the compatibility warning that was displayed on the first Windows Media Player launch after installing WMPCDText.
