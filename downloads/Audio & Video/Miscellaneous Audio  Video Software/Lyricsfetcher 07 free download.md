**Publisher's Description**  
  

LyricsFetcher sorts through your iTunes or Windows Media Player music library
and fetches lyrics for the songs.

**Features:**

  * Fetchs lyrics for songs 
  * Works with iTunes or Windows Media Player 
  * Can look up a songA's title and artist based on the music itself 

**What's New in version 0.7:**

  * Second attempt at avoiding black diamonds. It is still not perfect -- but it is better than before. 
  * Ctrl-A now works in all text fields. 
  * New settings properties. These don't have a user interface yet -- you can only change them by editing the LyricsFetcher.exe.config file in the application directory. Please take a copy of the original before changing it. 
    * AppendSuccessFailureTag - Change this value to "False" to prevent LyricsFetcher from writing a success or failure tag onto the lyrics. Without this, LyricsFetcher will not be able to tell that it has already failed to find lyrics for a song. 
    * MissingLyricsPrefixes - If the lyrics for a song begin with one of these prefixes, LyricsFetcher will treat the lyrics as not found. Useful if some provider starts returning strange results which are actually errors. 
    * IgnoredGenres - If the genre of the track is in this list, LyricsFetcher will not try to find lyrics for that track.
