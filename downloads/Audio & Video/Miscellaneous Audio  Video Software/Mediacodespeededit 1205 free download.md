**Publisher's Description**  
  

MediaCodeSpeedEdit allows you to change the write speed for your media and to
add new media codes to your firmware by renaming an already available media
code. The new media code name can be entered manually or can be imported from
the DVD Identifier media code output to be sure that no special characters are
lost. This kind of media code renaming will remove the original media code
name from the patched firmware, so it is no longer supported by the firmware.

Real adding of additional media code names would mean to shift and extend all
internal media code tables or patching all media code scanner for all
supported firmwares, which would be a quite complex task.

MCSE allows strategy swapping to increase the write speed by double clicking
the media code and selecting an alternative write strategy from a list.
Depending on the firmware this swapping is lossless, which means the media
code of the choosen, usually faster write strategy is not changed. On some
firmwares this swapping is done by renaming the media codes, so the choosen
media code can not be used anymore.
