One of the simplest ways of turning your computer into a powerful piano is
using Everyone Piano. This software perfectly simulates a real keyboard piano
even when you are using the computerAs sound card. All you need to play the
piano is your ordinary computer keyboard.

**Installation**

Everyone Piano installs easily and provides the option to open the program as
soon as you complete the installation. There is no need of re-starting the
computer.

**Using Everyone Piano**

It is relatively easy even for an inexperienced person to play this computer
piano. Keyboard keys that do not function appear darker than the responsive
ones.

Each row of buttons plays a different pitch, which allows the computer
keyboard to accommodate a full piano keyboard. We could even use the number
and arrow keys. The program displays computer keyboard buttons above the full
piano. You can use either the virtual keyboard or physical computer keyboard,
and you will see the corresponding keys on the piano appear depressed.

Everyone Piano does not only give you the opportunity to play the piano but
also load songs and record your own. You can tune the piano and even simulate
the foot pedal.

The toolbar provides options for opening audio files and performing a number
of settings. Here is a brief look at what each menu does:

**File**

  * Open 
  * Play 
  * Record 
  * Save 

The program came with .eop files that we could open for it to play as we
watched it simulate the keys pressed to play the songs.

**AudioSource**

  * Load VSTi 
  * Show The Interface 
  * How To Load High-Quality Audio Source? 
  * Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth MIDI 
  * mdaPiano VSTi 
  * Plucked String VSTi 

We used these options to choose different musical instruments.

**Keyboard**

We used the options provided here to change or revert to default keyboard
settings, which changed the keys the computer piano responded to.

**Settings**

  * Options menu allowed us to change Audio, Interface and Instrument settings. 
  * Windows allowed us to choose the windows to display in the program, including Computer Keyboard Window, Piano Keyboard Window and Tuning Window. 

The program also has Plugin and Help menus that you can use to add plugins and
read the online handbook respectively. The Help menu also allows you to update
the keyboard piano, access hot videos or get in touch with the software
makers.

**Changing Appearance**

Switching skins is as easy as clicking on the T shirt-like button next to the
Minimize button and choosing the desired option. Everyone piano comes with 10
different skins, ranging from Black Metal to Grey City, which look almost the
same. However, the skins in between will give you completely different looks.
Whichever skin you choose, the unresponsive keyboard buttons will appear
darker.

**Conclusion**

Everyone Piano is a powerful computer piano that simulates an actual keyboard
piano. If you want to play a piano without the bells and whistles associated
with modern systems, then this is a good choice for you.
