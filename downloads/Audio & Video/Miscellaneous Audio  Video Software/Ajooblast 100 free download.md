Chime AjooBlast lets you play your mp3 and wma music files from anywhere! Just
start it in the Server mode at home, go to your work and listen to your songs
in the Player mode, without downloading each file. Smallest. P2P app. Ever.

AjooBlast is different from Internet audio broadcasting (like Shoutcast)
because you donA't have to make playlists etc. You can simply browse through
your music collection. It is also different from P2P apps like Kazaa, Gnutella
etc. because only you and your friends can access your collection - not
strangers. You can listen to a friendA's music collection while they check out
yours - instantly!

Works smoothly on dialups too! Password-protection, port-selections, and
extremely secure. What more could you ask for in a no-nag, no-adware, no-
spyware, fully-functional freeware?
