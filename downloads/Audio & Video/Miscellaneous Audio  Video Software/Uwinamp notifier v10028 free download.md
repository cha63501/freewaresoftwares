**Publisher's Description**  
  

uWinamp is a add-on to Winamp, which detects when a new song loads to playback
and then based on current track, forces a freeform skinnable alert to top
right screen corner.

This alert may be provided with current track title, artist, album, genre,
comments, time, duration et cetera. Not only for notification purpose, you got
a chanse to skip track, go to previous, increase/decrease volume, jump to
file/time etc. depending on current skin.

This alert would pop up (or fade up if not freeformed) but it wins no focus.
The program itself would never be revealed but will allways be avaible from
the system tray (the icons near the system clock in the activityfield).

Rightclick on the NSS icon to reach all functions. Leftclick to skip to next
track, control-klick to go to the previous. Why you should download? Free and
offers extreme comfort!
