**Publisher's Description**  
  

Sonic beacon is a PC-based test and measurement system for the testing of
loudspeakers and other electro-acoustic products using commercially available
Windows multimedia sound cards. Sonic beacon will perform Frequency and Phase
Response, Harmonic and Intermodulation Distortion, Polarity, Impedance,
Sensitivity and SPL as well as other FFT and Real Time Analysis tests, Sixteen
bit sampling rates up to 192 kHz and FFT lengths up to 128K points are
supported.

Sonic beacon contains six different virtual instruments that can be cascaded
in order to form a process. An input signal emanating from a WAVE audio file,
the Signal generator or a sound card may be passed serially from one module to
another. Each module performs a process on this signal and alters its time or
frequency domain representation. If the modules are coherently cascaded a
sensible analysis can be done on the input signal.
