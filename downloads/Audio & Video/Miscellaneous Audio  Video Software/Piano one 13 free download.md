**Publisher's Description**  
  

Piano One is a free audio plugin and its sound comes from the Yamaha C7
concert grand, a true workhorse in the professional piano world.

The Yamaha C7 concert grand appeared on famous concert stages, in
international competitions and in world-renowned music events.

Having incorporated the Sound Magic Hybrid Modeling Engine, Piano One provides
both the Realistic Sound of Sampling and the Playability of Modeling. Hybrid
Modeling provides an instantaneous feeling - no delay - and a truer and richer
sound than canbe created with either sampling or modeling alone.

Moreover, Piano One occupies only 160MB, which is very little, making Piano
One usable even on older computers. There is no waiting time when loading and
the CPU usage is so small that itA's virtually unnoticeable.

  * Sound Magic Hybrid Modeling Technology
  * 32 Polyphony Limited
  * Add-on System (needs internet connection)
  * Actual modeling and soft pedal samples vividly present the sound of three kinds of pedals.
  * Actual Modeling of the key release sound
  * Built-in professional Reverb Engine simulates resonances with environment and soundboard, adding extra realism to the sound.
  * Faster load times. Smaller hard drive footprint, less memory and less CPU usage.
