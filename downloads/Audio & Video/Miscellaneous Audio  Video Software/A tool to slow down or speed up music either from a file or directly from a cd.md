**Publisher's Description**  
  


BestPractice is a tool to slow down or speed up music, either from a file or directly from a CD. The thing is, that ordinarily the sound is distorted when slowed down our sped up - you get the effect like when playing a 45 rpm record on 33 rpm speed. BestPractice tries to correct this, so you can slow down and speed up music, while keeping the original tune. Since version 0.3 you can also change the pitch of the music without affecting its length.
