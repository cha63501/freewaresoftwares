Camera control and positioning for Mobotix cams without positioning interface.

The main window shows all important information you need. First you must move
the camera position to the reference point. The reference point is the
leftmost position. After that you must set the nullposition using the button :
A'Set NullA'. Now you can drive to any positions and take them into the list
by using the A'NewA' - button. It is the same procedure for updating
positions. You can drive to positions directly by using the contextmenu. In
minmized mode the program will stop the live-stream for optimizing the system.
The pictures will be saved over the camera directly.
