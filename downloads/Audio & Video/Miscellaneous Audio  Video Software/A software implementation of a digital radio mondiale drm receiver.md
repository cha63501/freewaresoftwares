**Publisher's Description**  
  


Dream is a software implementation of a Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) receiver. With Dream, DRM broadcasts can be received with a modified analog receiver (SW, MW, LW) and a PC with a sound card. 

Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) is the digital radio standard for the long-, medium- and short-wave ranges. The system offers the radio stations and new service providers access to the multimedia age with small bit rates for large target areas and long distances. 

This software project implements a working software receiver with, at least, the basic features. Since this project was created at a university and the fundamental idea of such an institution is to teach and stimulate the creativity, this source-code is free under the GNU-General Public License (GPL). Dream is a development project which uses the open source model to improve DRM technology. The main aim of this project is to implement and test new research results on an existing system, whereby the synchronization and channel estimation is of special interest.
