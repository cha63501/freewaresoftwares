DirectShow Detective helps you to verify your DirectShow installation.

It shows you the complete list of your installed DirectShow filters, video
compressors and audio compressors, their version and installed file.

Ever installed some software or codec pack and suddenly your whole system is
messed up? Your Windows Media Player wonA't play the regular files anymore,
and your video software, which has been working fine, no longer works?

Some codec packs contain problematic installation and they may replace your
working filters or codecs. By using DirectShow Detective, you can find out the
running versions of each component. It will help you to find out whether a
problematic filter or codec has been installed or overwritten.
