**Publisher's Description**  
  

Win7shell is a simple plugin for Winamp that integrates it with the new
taskbar of Windows 7. As you may know the taskbar offers lots of new features,
which you can read about everywhere, including here. Why would you need this?
The new taskbar features were designed to improve the convenience of the user,
adding visible information and shortcuts where you need it, but Winamp
doesnA't take advantage of these. Until now.

**Features:**

  * shows playback status and progress in the icon background of the taskbar icon 
  * uses taskbar icon to display a "VU meter" 
  * shows playback status using icon overlays on the taskbar icon 
  * customizes the aero peek thumbnail with: 
    * Winamp logo 
    * album art 
    * customized information about the current media playing 
    * custom image file 
  * adds player control buttons on the aero peek thumbnail 
  * adds the playing media to the A'RecentA' category of the jump list 
  * Winamp is now easier to find in 3DFlip 

**Compatibility and convenience:**

  * Translation support (Unicode and rigth-to-left support) 
  * fully compatible with Winamp and Windows 7 
  * all features can be turned on and off 
  * thumbnail information is selected and customized by user 
  * full UNICODE support 

**What's New in version 1.13:**

  * New: Added option to activate (somewhat) smoother text scrolling, and drawing in general > more CPU usage 
  * Improvement: Rating drawing on the aero peek is similar to what you see on the Bento skin, the missing stars till 5 are "padded" with bulbs 
  * Improvement: Album art is not forced to square anymore, it keeps aspect ratio 
  * Fix: Some of the Winamp exit crashes / hangs, and some other minor ones... please report if you notice any more 
  * (Some other changes I might forgot)
