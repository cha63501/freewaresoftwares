SimplePiano is an aid for the beginner whoA's learning to play piano and read
music.

It uses Maestro fonts (that are installed with the program) to show the notes
played on the treble and bass clef staffs. The notes played are also
highlighted on a 60-key on-screen piano keyboard. You can play it using the
keyboard, the mouse, or a midi keyboard connected to the computer (the M-Audio
Keystation 61es is recommended).

The Circle of Fifths can be displayed, and when a key in it is selected, that
keyA's signature is shown on the staffs. Any of the eight most-used chords can
be selected and played by playing the chordA's root key. Chord inversions can
also be selected. A random note reading exercise is included.

The midi instrument (128 choices) and output sound (Windows or soundcard
sound) are selectable.
