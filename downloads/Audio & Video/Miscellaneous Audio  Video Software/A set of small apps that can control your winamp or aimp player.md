**Publisher's Description**  
  


WinampControlApps is a set of small apps that can control your Winamp or AIMP player. 

Besides simple playback and volume contols, also the are two unique apps: **StartPlayPause**, which can start player and playback at one stroke, or acts as pause is playback if already started, and **DeleteAndNext**, which helps to keep your music library nice and clean - it deletes currently playing track from the disk (well, in a recycle bin, actually). And itA's fully compatable with both Winamp and AIMP players!

This is a free software with open sources (GNU GPLv3). 

Here is a full list of applications included:

  * **StartPlayPause**: If player is not running, it will be launched and playback will be started; if player is already running, this app acts as a play/pause toggle. If you have both Winamp and AIMP players installed, AIMP will be launched;
  * **DeleteAndNext**: Deletes currently playing trackA's file in the recycle bin, and starts playback of a next track. ItA's the only app that requires administrative rights; also due to specific algorithm some antivirus software may incorrectly identify DeleteAndNext.exe file as a virus;
  * **Play**: If player is not running, it will be launched and playback will be started; if player is already running, this app do the same as playerA's Play button. If you have both Winamp and AIMP players installed, AIMP will be launched;
  * **Pause**: The same as playerA's Pause button;
  * **Stop**: The same as playerA's Stop button;
  * **Next**: The same as playerA's Next track button;
  * **Prev**: The same as playerA's Previous track button;
  * **VolUp**: Increase volume;
  * **VolDown**: Decrease volume.

Although any of WinampControlApps can be launched as normal programs, for best experience they must be **assigned to hotkeys**, additional keyboard/mouse buttons (if available) or to remote control. See projectA's home page for more info.
