**WhatA's New in version 3.0:**

This new major release fixes many Java bugs in the GUI and the logarithm frequency scale and gives the application an overall performance boost. The new features are: 

  * Added a welcome screen with basic instructions what Sonogram is and how to get a quick first glance of the programm. The welcome screen will be shown when the application starts first time. 
  * Added a floating information window in the main sonogram which shows the amplitude, frequency, time and level under the current mouse position. 
  * The logarithm frequency-scale was rewritten and became like the image smoothing functions a tolbar-button in the main window. 
  * The single spektrum view in the main window was rewritten and shows now a smarter spektrum image. 
  * The whole GUI was over-worked and the application startup procedure became like the image painting routines a strong a performance boost. The design became a facelift.
