Batch Subtitles Converter is a portable application designed to help users
convert multiple subtitles to 100 different formats. You will find it easy to
configure the utility so long as you have basic computer knowledge.

You can add files using either the built-in browser facility or via drag and
drop. If you want, you may change their frames per second or encoding methods.
You may also change font name, size and color by pressing the button with the
TT icon. The application is compatible with different subtitles formats, such
as RTF, XML, SUB and SRT, which you may either import or export.

You select the output folder via the AFileA menu and then click the AConvertA
button to start the batch process.

it on a USB flash drive.
