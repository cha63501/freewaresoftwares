**Publisher's Description**  
  

Freeware application that allows you to control the volume of your computer
using the mousewheel. When the mouse wheel is clicked (middle mouse button)
the sound will be muted. When used with a full screen application the top
right corner will be used. Extremely intuitive in use. Uses very little
computer resources and comes with full installer and deinstaller. Standard
functions of the mousewheel are not affected in any way.
