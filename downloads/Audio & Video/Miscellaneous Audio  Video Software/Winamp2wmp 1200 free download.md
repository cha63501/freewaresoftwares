**Publisher's Description**  
  

Winamp2WMP allows you to easily copy your Winamp playlists into Windows Media
Player. This will allow you to upload your Winamp playlists into Google Music
via Windows Media Player.

When opened, the tool will look in the likely locations for the Winamp
playlists.xml file. If it can not be found, you can drag & drop the file into
the tool to save the location for future use. Playlists are automatically
located and pre-filled in the tool UI as buttons. Simply click a button to
export that playlist into Windows Media Player. Depending on the size of the
playlist, it may take WMP 20 seconds or more for each playlist until all the
tracks are completely imported.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com
