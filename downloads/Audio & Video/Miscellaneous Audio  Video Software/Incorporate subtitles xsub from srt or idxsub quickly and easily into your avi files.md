**Publisher's Description**  
  


AVIAddXSubs is a simple free program to incorporate subtitles (XSUB) from .srt (ANSI text, up to 8 srt) or idx/sub (containing up to 8 subtitles) quickly and easily to your avi files containing DivX/XVid video streams. Just place the avi and its associated (same name) srt in the same directory and Drag&Drop the avi on AVIAddXSubs icon or shortcut in your desktop. In 2-3 minutes a new file with divx extension will be created and be ready to play in your hardware DivX player. 

For example from the files:

lost0318.avi  
lost0318.srt

you get

lost0318.divx, to play in your hardware DivX player.

To see the subtitles you have to activate them through your remote control much like you do with normal DVD. Check the configuration page of the program for the offered options. Maybe you have to put a smaller number at "Vertical Position" field if subtitles are selectable, are selected, but do not appear. The generated file is a regular avi and you can rename it if this helps the player. 

**WhatA's New in version 9.15:**

  * Added option A'Merge mkv and idx/subA' (Configuration 2 tab). If this option is checked AVIAddXSubs merges mkv files with idx/sub subtitles generated from srt. It appears that some TVs support idx/sub only if they are merged with mkv and not as separate files. This options automates idx/sub incorporation to mkv files instead of using, as an additional manual step, mkvmerge GUI to do the same. This to work mkvmerge.exe utility has to be copied in AVIAddxSubs installation directory.
