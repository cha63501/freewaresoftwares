**Publisher's Description**  
  

Sound Borb is an audio ambience generating system. The generative nature of
Sound BorbA's audio engine means that once you hit play, the ambience youA're
listening to will never end. It will never go to the next track. It will never
loop. If you want to listen to the ocean, you can listen to the ocean from now
until your electricity goes out.

Parameters are kept to a minimum, so as to make Sound Borb easy to use. Just
load an ambience, and start listening. You can adjust the overall volume, the
intensity (how much activity is occuring in the sound), and the happiness of
the ambience. Or you can set the intensity and happiness parameters to auto,
and sit back and listen.

This download includes the following ambiences: Ocean Ambience and Umbra.
Various ambiences are available for download on the [developerA's download
page](http://www.gersic.com/soundborb/download.php), and you can also create
your own and post them for download, if youA're so inclined.
