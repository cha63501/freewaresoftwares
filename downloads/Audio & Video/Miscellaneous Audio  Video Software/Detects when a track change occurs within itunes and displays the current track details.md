NotifyTunes is a small utility that interacts with iTunes for Windows, to display track information even if iTunes is currently not the active application or is minimised to the taskbar. The application detects when a track change occurs within iTunes and displays a pop-up window containing the current track details. 

_Now updated!_ New version now includes Automatic Update Checking and editable track ratings.

Track Information Display - NotifyTunes displays a compact pop-up window whenever iTunes changes the currently playing audio track. This windows displays the current track information - Title, Artist, Album, Year, Rating and Cover Art (if available). It even displays the currently active playlist.

Discrete - NotifyTunes resides in the Notification Area on the Task Bar (sometimes know as the A'System TrayA'), and will happily stay there even if iTunes is not currently running. When activated, the track information window is displayed in a configurable location on screen - informing you of the current track whilst allowing you to get on with using your PC.

If you miss the pop-up window or forget the track details - donA't worry. You can double click on the NotifyTunes icon, or right click it and select A'Now Playing...A' from the menu to force the pop-up window to display the current track information again.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx).
