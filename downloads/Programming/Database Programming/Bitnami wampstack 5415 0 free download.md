**Publisher's Description**  
  

**BitNami WAMPStack** Native Installer is an easy-to-install environment to develop and deploy PHP applications. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run versions of Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin so users can get the environment up and running in minutes after answering a few questions. Windows operating systems are supported. 

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in.
The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
generated pages quickly.

The MySQL software delivers a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user, and
robust SQL (Structured Query Language) database server. MySQL Server is
intended for mission-critical, heavy-load production systems as well as for
embedding into mass-deployed software. MySQL is aregistered trademark of Sun
Microsystems, Inc.

Here are some key features of the BitNami Stacks Native Installers:

**Easy to Install:**  

BitNami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as possible
to install open source software. Our installers completely automate the
process of installing and configuring all of the software included in each
Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

**Independent:**  

BitNami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere
with any software already installed on your system.

**Integrated:**  

By the time you click the A'finishA' button on the installer, the whole stack
will be integrated, configured and ready to go.

**Relocatable:**  

BitNami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have
multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each
other.
