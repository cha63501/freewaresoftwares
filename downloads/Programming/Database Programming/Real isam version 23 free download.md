Real Isam is a full featured Freeware Library (DLL) that uses the ISAM
(Indexed Sequentiel Access Method) to manage access keys and variable length
data records. It is an efficient tool for text oriented data, like word
definition, e-mail storage, character string fields, XML, HTML pages, CSS
objects, indexes etc. It uses a balanced b-tree technique and allows all basic
ISAM operations; Real Isam is Object Oriented, meaning you can use as many
isam files as you want.

Up to 64 indexes. Data records binary or text, variable length. Easy interface
with Borland C++, Delphi and other languages. Example provided. Small
footprint, very fast access.
