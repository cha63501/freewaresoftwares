**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is a simple utility that can perform a SQL commands on a database. You can execute an insert, update or delete commands as well as select statements. Utility returns the number of processed records as its ExitCode and you can also save the results (selected records or the processed records number) to the specified XML, CSV or TXT file. 

It is possible to immediately transform the resulting XML file by the selected XSL stylesheet template, so you can export the result to as many text based formats as you want. 

The sql statement may include parameters prepended with a colon (ie. :NAME or :CITY, etc.). Then the user can enter the parameter values in the simple editable grid of parameters. Statement is run as many times as rows in the grid, the user defines. 

If you run the utility without command-line parameters, the full GUI is displayed, so you can specify and save the parameters, that you can use later by a command-line execution.
