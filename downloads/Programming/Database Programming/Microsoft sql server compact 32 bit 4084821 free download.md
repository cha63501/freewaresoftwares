Microsoft SQL Server Compact 4.0 is a free, embedded database that software
developers can use for building ASP.NET websites and Windows desktop

of its binaries within the application folder, easy application development in
Visual Studio and WebMatrix, and seamless migration of schema and data to SQL
Server.
