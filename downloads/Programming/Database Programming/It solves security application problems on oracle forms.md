Security Agent for Oracle Forms is a tool that solves the security application problem on the Oracle Forms. It allows the implementation of applications Oracle Forms (6.0 and 6i) in order to manage business transactions in a differential way on the basis of the Oracle roles granted to each user. 

Security Agent for Oracle Forms allows you to automatically set the properties (displayed, enabled, insert, update, where clause, etc.) of Oracle Forms objects (Item, Block, Lov, Menu, Form) according to the Oracle roles granted to user session and determines which users have access to a specific object of Oracle Forms and the specific types of actions allowed for each user on the object according to the Oracle roles granted to user session.

This is possible through the control of the properties of the OracleA(r) Forms objects.

Each form can allow different operative modalities on the basis of both role of session user and state of data handled in each moment through the automatic control of the properties of the OracleA(r) Forms objects; it occurs respecting performances and optimization of the network traffic.

With Security Agent (S.A.) all the application changes which originate from the business reorganization will not be implemented changing the source code of the applications, but just setting up a standard tool useful for every business application.

Free for up to 5 clients. Requires: Oracle Form 6.0/6.i, Oracle DBMS 7.x-9i
