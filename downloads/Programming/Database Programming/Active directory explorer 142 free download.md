**Publisher's Description**  
  

Active Directory Explorer (AD Explorer) is an advanced Active Directory (AD)
viewer and editor. You can use AD Explorer to easily navigate an AD database,
define favorite locations, view object properties and attributes without
having to open dialog boxes, edit permissions, view an objectA's schema, and
execute sophisticated searches that you can save and re-execute.

AD Explorer also includes the ability to save snapshots of an AD database for
off-line viewing and comparisons. When you load a saved snapshot, you can
navigate and explorer it as you would a live database. If you have two
snapshots of an AD database you can use AD ExplorerA's comparison
functionality to see what objects, attributes and security permissions changed
between them.

**What's New in version 1.42:**

  * This addresses a regression in v1.41 that prevented AdExplorer from connecting to some Light Weight Directory Service databases.
