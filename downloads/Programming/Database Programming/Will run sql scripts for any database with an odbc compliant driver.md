**Publisher's Description**  
  


SQL Batch Executor will run SQL scripts for any database with an ODBC compliant driver. 

A few years ago, I created a very simple version of this application in order to do my job more effectively. Because I usually generate most of my SQL statements, I had many problems running a series of statements in MS Access. From that application I realized; many other programmers, DBAs, and power users, may have the same problem. And probably in other database formats.

This application is meant to bridge the efficiency gap with all available ADO / ODBC connectable databases and provide a consistent interface for their manipulation.
