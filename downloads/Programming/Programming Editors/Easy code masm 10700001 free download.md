**Publisher's Description**  
  

Easy Code is the visual assembly programming environment made to build 32-bit
Windows applications (supporting Unicode, multiple languages and building
drivers). To compile and link the projects designed on its IDE, Easy Code uses
MASM32 or GeneSys, complete programming tools packages including the Microsoft
Macro Assembler. The Easy Code interface, looking like Visual Basic, allows
you to program a Windows assembler application in a quick and easy way as
never possible before.

Download and test this application which includes the source code of a nice CD
player, a complete and fast text editor in a dll file (to be able to program
your own editor), a complete and excellent text editor (GeneSys) ready to use,
a file shredder, a MIDI player and many other applications.
