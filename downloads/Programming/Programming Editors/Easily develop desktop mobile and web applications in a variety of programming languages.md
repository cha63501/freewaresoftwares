NetBeans IDE is an Integrated Development Environment specifically designed for programmers to help them develop web, mobile and desktop applications easily. It supports the latest Java Technologies and specification enhancements in addition to other state-of-the-art technologies. The IDE comes with a wide variety of tools, features, samples and templates. 

**Features:**

  * Fast and smart code editing 
  * Easy and efficient project management 
  * Rapid user interface development 
  * Bug-free code writing 
  * Multilanguage support 
  * Cross platform support 
  * Compatible with many community-provided plugins 
Although NetBeans IDE was initially designed to provide a Java develepment environment, it is also helpful in creating and developing applications in either C or C++. This is a very convenient feature because developers donAt have to switch between different programs when they want to develop projects in different environments. 

**Using NetBeans IDE**

We found it relatively easy to select the type of project we wanted to create via the File menu. We could even use it to create and compile applets and cellphone apps. The program allowed us to manage projects written with different codes.

The drag-and-drop tools and editors make it easy to develop applications quickly and without a hitch. The GUI builder for Java SE apps corrects space alignment automatically and supports in-place editing.

The FindBugs tool and static analysis tools allowed us to identify and fix bugs before compiling. We also placed breakpoints in our source code with the NetBeans Debugger and monitor executions as they happened. The ability to see inconsistencies in real time sets NetBeans apart from other development platforms.

The Code Folding feature simplifies the debugging process by collapsing parts of code within the same class name or function.

We loved the auto-complete feature not only because it allowed us to work faster but also due to the fact that it eliminates errors since it provides previously defined names. We also didnAt have to scroll back in case of a name we had forgotten.

The Garbage Collector does a good job of cleaning allocated memory that is no longer used by referenced applications. This removes unnecessary data from Virtual memory to improve the overall performance of software.

vWe imported projects, changed their code and rebuilt them to suit our requirements. We could also view services that different applications used and make necessary adjustments to make them more compatible with our software. 

NetBeans Integrated Development Environment provides a Navigator window that makes it easy to see all classes defined in the selected Java file. This is a handy feature considering the difficulty associated with managing class files. When we clicked on the file name, we instantly accessed the specific part of code defining that class, which made it easy to jump to different classes without scrolling through the code.

NetBeans IDE enables developers to create applications smoothly and quickly in either Java, PHP, HTML5, CSS, C or C++. The only reservation we have with the development environment is that it consumes a lot of computer resources.
