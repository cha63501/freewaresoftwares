**Publisher's Description**  
  


LaTeX Editor, called later LEd, is a free environment for rapid TeX/LaTeX document development. LEdA's capabilities vary according to the operating system used, e.g., Visual Styles from WindowsA(r) XP. It, however, works with almost all functionality also on WindowsA(r) 95. 

LEd offers a project manager, powerful editor, integrated spellchecker and thesaurus, build-in DVI viewer, descriptive hints for LaTeX commands, code complete mechanism, word wrapping, code folding, multilingual environment, and more. Nevertheless, LaTeX Editor is a small program. The whole package without thesauri data occupies only 6 MB of disk space, while the fully functional version for one language needs about 2.0 MB. Please go to the overview page if you are interested in a more detailed description of LEd.
