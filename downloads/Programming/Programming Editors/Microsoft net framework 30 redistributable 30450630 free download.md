**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 (formerly known as WinFX), is the new managed
code programming model for Windows. It combines the power of the .NET
Framework 2.0 with new technologies for building applications that have
visually compelling user experiences, seamless communication across technology
boundaries, and the ability to support a wide range of business processes.

These new technologies are Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows
Communication Foundation, Windows Workflow Foundation, and Windows CardSpace
(formerly code named "Infocard"). Microsoft plans to ship .NET Framework 3.0
as part of the Windows Vista operating system.

In addition, Microsoft is making these technologies available on Windows XP
and Windows Server 2003. The following Community Technology Preview of .NET
Framework 3.0 enables you to continue experimenting with early builds of these
technologies, get acquainted with the development experience, and provide
feedback to Microsoft.
