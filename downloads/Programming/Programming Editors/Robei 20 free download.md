**Publisher's Description**  
  

Robei is the world smallest EDA tool (less than 5Mbits) for Verilog based EDA
software. It integrates modern graphical user interface and a tiny cross
platform Verilog simulator. The biggest advantage of this software is that it
is totally free for personal, education and research use. For commercial
version, please contact us.

Although Robei is very tiny, it has almost all the functionalities of a EDA
software. Robei has modern GUI, Verilog compiler, property editor, code viewer
and waveform viewer. The modern user interface of Robei provides visualization
of FPGA design and simplified it by playing with reusable models and ports.
The Toolbox is designed to contain huge of model libraries, and no matter
where is your models. Property designer offers the most convenient method for
viewing and changing values in code. All these parts are designed to be as
simple as possible for designer. As long as you familiar with Verilog
language, you can manage it in 15 minutes.

With this tool, you can design your hardware visually in both RTL level and
behavior level, and view the simulation result through waveform. It is a tiny,
fast software for hardware prototyping and verification.

**Note:** Requires free registration.
