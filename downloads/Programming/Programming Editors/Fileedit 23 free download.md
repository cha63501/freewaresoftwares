**Publisher's Description**  
  

This allows you to either safely scan through a file or edit one. Allowing the
Formatting to show will block showing characters over 126.

It is safe to scan any file, but beware making changes while Editing a File
can corrupt it, and then activating after could upset your system, unless you
know exactly what you are doing.

This especially applies to those files in the Windows, or the Program Files
Directory. Hex values are shown in editing, but use Decimal values to enter
changes.
