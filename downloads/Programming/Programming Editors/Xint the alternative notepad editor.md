**Publisher's Description**  
  


Xint is an alternative to Windows notepad, with dozens of useful functions. The focus is on efficiency and performance. Most of the functions are accessible via hotkeys, and extra formatting options are also available through a convenient floating menu that is activated also via hotkeys or the system menu to wherever your cursor happens to be. Make extracting html content from a text file, or alternately, saving only the html easy. Turn tab space delimited text files into comma delimited files, or, vice-a-versa. Xint does the standard find and replace much quicker then with regular notepad. Another thing that is of great convenience, is "Twofish" encryption. Use Twofish, a military-strength 160-bit encryption algorithm to securely hide sensitive data. xint is a fairly resource-friendly application which comes with an uninstaller. Hope you find it useful.
