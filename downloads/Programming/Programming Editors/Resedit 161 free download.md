ResEdit is a free Resource Editor for Win32 programs. You can use it if you
want to use dialogs, icon, version information or other types of resources.
Output files can be compiled by any Win32 compiler, like MinGW and Microsoft
Visual C++. To open a file which uses Win32 API symbolic constants, you will
also need Win32 header files (usually coming with you compiler).
