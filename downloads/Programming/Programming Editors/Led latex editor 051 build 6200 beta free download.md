**Publisher's Description**  
  

LaTeX Editor, called later LEd, is a free environment for rapid TeX/LaTeX
document development. LEdA's capabilities vary according to the operating
system used, e.g., Visual Styles from WindowsA(r) XP. It, however, works with
almost all functionality also on WindowsA(r) 95.

LEd offers a project manager, powerful editor, integrated spellchecker and
thesaurus, build-in DVI viewer, descriptive hints for LaTeX commands, code
complete mechanism, word wrapping, code folding, multilingual environment, and
more. Nevertheless, LaTeX Editor is a small program. The whole package without
thesauri data occupies only 6 MB of disk space, while the fully functional
version for one language needs about 2.0 MB. Please go to the overview page if
you are interested in a more detailed description of LEd.
