**Publisher's Description**  
  

Construct is powerful and easy to use development software for both DirectX
9-based games and applications. It includes an event based system for defining
how the game or application will behave, in a visual, human-readable way.

Optionally, you can also use Python scripting to code your creations. Features
include pixel shader effects, physics engine, layering, debugger, 50+ plugins,
motion blur and 3D lighting effects.

**Features:**

  * No programming or scripting is needed. 
  * Super fast hardware-accelerated DirectX 9 graphics engine 
  * Add multiple pixel shaders for advanced special effects, including lighting, HDR, distortion, lenses and more 
  * Physics engine for realistic object behavior 
  * Place object on different layers for organizing display, parallaxing, or whole-layer effects 
  * Debugger giving you complete control over all aspects of your game for testing purposes. 
  * Smaller, faster specialized runtime for applications 
  * 50+ plugins ranging from Tiled Background to database access 
Construct runs on Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista and is 32-bit
software. A graphics card with pixel shader 2.0 is recommended.

**Array:**

  * [FIX] Crash in array object default expression 

**Editor:**

  * [CHANGE] You can now run more than one preview in parallel.
