CodeDesigner is free and open-source RAD tool suitable for easy creation of various diagrams describing applicationsA' structure and logic (class diagrams, state charts, ...) and for generation of production-ready source code from them.

In contrast to other similar CASE tools the CodeDesigner is aimed to generation of production-ready source code from supported diagrams.

  * UML class diagrams 
  * Simple state chart 
  * Hierarchical (UML, Harel) state charts 

**Supported programming languages:**

  * ANSI C 
  * C++ 
  * Python 

**WhatA's New in version 1.6.1.2994 Beta:**

  * Fixed position of generated 'include' in code items header file. 
  * Fixed code generation of state chart's IDs if 'Inline code' property for the state chart is set to TRUE. 
  * Fixed crash occurred when an action was added to the composite state.
