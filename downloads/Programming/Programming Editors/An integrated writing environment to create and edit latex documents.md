**Using TeXstudio**

TeXstudio features a friendly user interface that makes it easy to build, manage and compile LaTeX documents. The program allowed us to create projects from templates or start from scratch.

We started by configuring the TeXstudio and other related commands by selecting the AOptionsA menu and selecting the AConfigure TeXstudioA command. We could also add our commands using the ABuildA command under AConfigure TeXstudio.A

The left pane gave us access to various tools we could use for different functions, including structure, accented letters, Greek letters, arrow and relation symbols, operator, bookmarks and delimiters among others. As a result, we found it relatively easy to create our documents.

We could insert mathematical functions and other LaTeX commands in addition to macros and bibliography entries. If you do not like the result of what you have done, you can always use the AUndoA feature. The program is also compatible with different line operations, including duplication, moving and erasing. It allows users to analyze text, and its ability to jump to error locations makes it easy to make necessary corrections.

TeXstudio allowed us to save the settings we used and profiles we created so we could use them later.

Browsing documents is easy because the AStructure ViewA on the left panel gives quick access to all parts of a document. We only had to click on specific items such as section or label to go to the start of the relevant area. We could see the cursor position in the AStructure ViewA as the corresponding background would turn grey. The view updated automatically as we typed.

The AAuto CompletionA feature made it easy to add LaTeX tags. All we had to do to get a list of possible tags was type a relevant letter after pressing /. Of course, typing more letters filtered the list further. 

TeXstudio is a very responsive LaTex editor although it requires a considerable amount of system resources.
