**Publisher's Description**  
  

Speller contains two components designed for Delphi: TSpellChecker and
TSpellLanguageComboBox:

TSpellChecker is a non-visual Delphi component designed to add spell check
capability to any application. It uses ISpell dictionaries installed with
"ISpell - LS-Distribution". Additionally, TSpellChecker can use spell check
dictionaries installed with MSOffice 95 or 97. For higher versions of
MSOffice, only some languages will work.

For easy choice of spell language, use TSpellLanguageComboBox.
TSpellLanguageComboBox is a visual Delphi component designed to display a list
of available spell dictionaries. It allows to select the active language used
by a TSpellChecker, and is part of this package.

Together with the spell check components, you will get some useful functions
for Unicode handling declared on the installed Units. See help file for
details.

Speller includes all source code!
