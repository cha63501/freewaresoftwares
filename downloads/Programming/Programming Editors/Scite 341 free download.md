**Publisher's Description**  
  

SciTE is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate
Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities for
building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple
configurations.

Text editing in SciTE works similarly to most Macintosh or Windows editors
with the added feature of automatic syntax styling. SciTE can hold multiple
files in memory at one time but only one file will be visible.
