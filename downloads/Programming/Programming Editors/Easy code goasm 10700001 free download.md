**Publisher's Description**  
  

Easy Code is the visual assembly programming environment made to build 32-bit
Windows applications (supporting Unicode, multiple languages and building
drivers). To compile and link the projects designed on its IDE, Easy Code uses
ECGo, a complete programming tools package including the Jeremy GordonsA's Go
tools. The Easy Code interface, looking like Visual Basic, allows you to
program a Windows assembler application in a quick and easy way as never
possible before.

Download and test this application which includes the source code of a
complete and fast text editor in a dll file (to be able to program your own
editor), a file shredder, a MIDI player and many other applications.
