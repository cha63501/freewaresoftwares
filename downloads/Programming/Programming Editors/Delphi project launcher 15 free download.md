**Publisher's Description**  
  

The idea is to let DPL scan folders for Delphi project files (dpr) and make a
list of them all, containing the title of the application (found in the dpr
file), the exe file and the path to the dpr file. If no title is found the
name on the first line of the dpr file is used. The exe file is found by
looking for an exe file with the same name as the dpr file.

The list is saved and reloaded next time you run DPL, but you can rescan the
folders any time. You can run the exe file or the project file as you wish.
This is a nice way to go through your old applications and wonder why you did
things in so amateurish a way...

The File Transit The minor list at the bottom is the Hotlist. Here you can add
the projects you are using most frequently. Drag and drop items from the
bigger list to the hotlist, where they will be sorted alphabetically.
