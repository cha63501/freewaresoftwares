**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tinn-R is free, simple but efficient basic code editor. It was initially
written as a small ASCII file editor primarily intended as a better
replacement for the default Notepad.exe program distributed with Windows. With
versions, it grew to a fairly complete, yet simple and compact code editor.

The project is coordinated by Jose Claudio Faria/UESC/DCET. All users are
welcome to make it better. LANGUAGE: Object Pascal, IDE: D7 and DELPHI 2007.

**Features:**

  * The ability to communicate with R (Rgui and Rterm) environment (send instructions, control and receive interpretations) Note that, starting from version 1.18.x.x, Tinn-R is not compatible anymore with Rgui in MDI mode (only SDI), nor with S-PLUS! 
  * Syntax highlight. Highlighting can be set by file type 
  * Create and manage projects 
  * Bookmarks: lines and blocks 
  * Support to Latex 
  * Work with files of unlimited length 
  * Work on several documents at the same time. Multiple document interface (MDI) and/or tabbed document interface (TDI)
