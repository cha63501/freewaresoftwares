**Publisher's Description**  
  


If you are using AltovaA's XMLSpy maybe you are also missing some file related functions. But XMLSpy lets you add PlugIns and even better you can also add ActiveX controls which are then available as Dialog Bars in XMLSpy. 

**The PlugIn offers the following key features:**

  * File Explorer Tab: You can see the file details and you can browse the directory of the currently active document with one mouse click! Sorting on file name, size and modification date is supported. 
  * History Tab: A list of all opened files until now. Double clicking the list item opens the file in XMLSpy. You can also see if the file was modified since it was open in XMLSpy for the last time because the history also remembers the last date and time when it was open in XMLSpy. The list can be sorted on opening and modification dates. 
  * Details Tab: This tab shows the number and name of the XML elements and attributes of the current document if it is displayed using Grid or Authentic view. The number of elements and attributes is always updated in GridView.
