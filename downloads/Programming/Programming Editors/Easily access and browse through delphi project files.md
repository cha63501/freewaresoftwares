**Publisher's Description**  
  


The idea is to let DPL scan folders for Delphi project files (dpr) and make a list of them all, containing the title of the application (found in the dpr file), the exe file and the path to the dpr file. If no title is found the name on the first line of the dpr file is used. The exe file is found by looking for an exe file with the same name as the dpr file. 

The list is saved and reloaded next time you run DPL, but you can rescan the folders any time. You can run the exe file or the project file as you wish. This is a nice way to go through your old applications and wonder why you did things in so amateurish a way...

The File Transit The minor list at the bottom is the Hotlist. Here you can add the projects you are using most frequently. Drag and drop items from the bigger list to the hotlist, where they will be sorted alphabetically.
