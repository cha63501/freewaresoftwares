**Publisher's Description**  
  

**BitNami Subversion Stack** Native Installer is an easy-to-install distribution of the Subversion application. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run versions of Apache and SQLite so users can get a Subversion installation up and running in minutes after answering a few questions. Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems are supported. 

Subversion has rapidly become the version control standard and it is rapidly
replacing open source and commercial solutions around the world. Subversion
enables globally distributed software development teams to efficiently version
and share source code. The open source Subversion project was started in early
2000 by CollabNet, the primary corporate sponsor of Subversion.

**Key Capabilities:**

  * Versioned directories
  * Atomic commits
  * Efficient handling of binary files
  * Quick branching and tagging
  * Directory and file meta data
  * Natively client-server
  * Minimal server and network requirements
  * Low admin overhead
  * Good security

Here are some key features of the BitNami Stacks Native Installers:

**Easy to Install:**

BitNami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as possible
to install open source software. Our installers completely automate the
process of installing and configuring all of the software included in each
Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

**Independent:**

BitNami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere
with any software already installed on your system.

**Integrated:**

By the time you click the A'finishA' button on the installer, the whole stack
will be integrated, configured and ready to go.

**Relocatable:**

BitNami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have
multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each
other.

**WhatA's New in version 1.7.1-0:**

  * Update Apache to 2.2.21 
  * Update Subversion to 1.7.1
