**Publisher's Description**  
  


With CodeSnip, you will no longer have to ask yourself "WhereA's that connection string I have been using?" or the few lines of code that were writing error messages to a log file. These will all be stored into your snippet repository, ready for use. You can find lots of snippets on the Internet. Just copy and paste the code, modify it and compile. But all this comes after searching for the right piece of code that you need on sites on the Internet and you are lucky if you place a bookmark in your Explorer for later reference. Use CodeSnip to save the code youA've found, name it, describe it and modify it to suit your needs. Create bricks for your on-going construction. 

Note: Windows 95/98/NT/2000 users must download and install **[Microsoft .NET Framework**](http://download.microsoft.com/download/.netframesdk/Redist/1.0/W98NT42KMeXP/EN-US/dotnetredist.exe) on your system before you install CodeSnip.
