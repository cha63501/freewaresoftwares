**Publisher's Description**  
  


MirrorJNDI is an open source Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) service provider for accessing arbitrary Java objects in a hierarchical namespace. 

MirrorJNDI can store all itA's data in XML or binary serialized form. It allows to create full copy of existing service providerA's data, serialize it and then work with local copy. It can be especially useful for testing interaction of your application with any JNDI service provider because you do not worry about possible loss of original data - you will delete, add or modify data in the local copy. You can also use MirrorJNDI to get started with Java Naming and Directory Interface.
