**Publisher's Description**  
  


LineTally is a freeware application designed to allow programmers to easily count the number of code lines in their programming projects. LineTally reports the total number of code lines, comment lines, mixed lines, and blank lines of the projectA's individual source file(s), and also of the whole project. LineTally can also report the percentages of the total code lines, comment lines, mixed lines, and blank lines of the projectA's individual source file(s) and of the whole project. 

Version 2.0 supports 58 programming languages, with the capability to define and count any unsupported language. It is also free of spyware, adware, and any malicious program that could potentially harm your PC. The aim of LineTally is to be very accurate (99.99% or greater accuracy), fast, versatile, and easy to use. It is also intended to be a freeware alternative to the few commercial line counters that are available (CodeCounter Pro and Practiline for example).
