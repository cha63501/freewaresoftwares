**Publisher's Description**  
  


NeatUpload allows ASP.NET developers to stream uploaded files to storage and allows users to monitor upload progress. It is open source and works under MonoA's XSP/mod_mono as well as MicrosoftA's ASP.NET implementation. It features 2 custom controls: InputFile allows the user to select a file to upload, and ProgressBar displays the upload progress either inline or in a popup. ProgressBar uses AJAX-style refreshless updates on modern browsers when JavaScript is available, but also allows users without JavaScript to see upload progress. 

**Features:**

  * Streams uploads directly to storage. This conserves server memory, allows larger uploads, and helps prevent Denial of Service attacks. 
  * Integrates easily with existing applications. Drag-and-drop the controls using the Visual Studios Web Forms Designer, or replace with and add a to your ASP.NET pages. Then use the properties of InputFile to access the uploaded file and its original name. 
  * Supports both inline and popup progress bars. 
  * Falls back to using ASP.NETA's HttpPostedFile if the NeatUpload HttpModule is not present. This makes it easy to remove the HttpModule if for some reason it causes problems. 
  * Supports customization through styles, custom progress display pages, and custom UploadStorageProviders. 
  * Supports AJAX-style refreshless updates of the progress bar. 
  * Does not require JavaScript. 
  * Works under MonoA's XSP/mod_mono and MicrosoftA's ASP.NET. 
  * Removes uploaded files when an error occurs. This helps prevent disk space leakage.
