**Publisher's Description**  
  


JMCAD is a program for the modeling and simulation of complex dynamic systems. This includes the ability to construct and simulate block diagrams. The visual block diagram interface offers a simple method for constructing, modifying and maintaining complex system models. The simulation engine provides fast and accurate solutions for linear, nonlinear, continuous time, discrete time, time varying and hybrid system designs. With JMCAD, users can quickly develop software or "virtual" prototypes of systems or processes to demonstrate their behavior prior to building physical prototypes. 

JMCAD offers a comprehensive set of companion products for frequency domain analysis, Java code generation, communications system modeling, DSP and embedded system design, neural networks and real-time analog and digital I/O.

The program is developed with use of language Java and can be used in various operational systems (Windows, Linux, Solaris, Unix, etc.).

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
