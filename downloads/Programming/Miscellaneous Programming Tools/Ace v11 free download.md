**Publisher's Description**  
  

ACE is a interpreter (A C Emulator) for a subset of standard ANSI C that runs
on the PIC family of microprocessors. It is intended for the same category of
applications as the Basic StampA system produced by Parallax Inc. The
advantage of an interpreted system for a novice are that little detailed
knowledge of the hardware is required and that it is (nearly) impossible to
crash the system due to a programming error.

There are about 45 PIC registers available to the user in the 16F84 version.
The code is extremely compact and a 2Kbyte memory allows C programs of up to
500 (editor) lines of code. Support is built in for the debouncing of inputs
and the control of RC servos. On the 18-pin PICs two of the ports are
internally programmed to control 2 standard RC servos. There are 9 IO ports
which can be programmed by the user.
