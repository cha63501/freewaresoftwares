**Publisher's Description**  
  

Libmotion library is ment to be used with .NET Framework and API is clean and
easy to understand. See examples how to use libmotion.

The idea is to create MotionImage object and access all the functionality
through that object. This might change in the future. Underlying design is
much more complicated but that complexity is hidden from the user.

Libmotion also includes class called BitmapProsessor which does have very fast
SetPixel and GetPixel implementation.

At the moment supported programming languages are C#, VB.NET and C++/CLI.
Later on native C++ support might be added, but any work for that is not even
started yet. Documentation is lacking but it will become available in the near
future. Until then you can use object browser to see functionality inside the
dll.

You can also use Motion to test how filters work before using them in your own
code.
