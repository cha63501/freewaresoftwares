**Publisher's Description**  
  

You want to test how your program or web site looks on a screen with lower
resolution than yours? You can change your screenA's resolution of course.

But it is probably more convenient just to resize your programA's or
browserA's window to the desired width and height. All you have to do is to
select the desired size and then click on the big button. The next window that
becomes the foreground window (by clicking on that window or itA's taskbar
button) will be resized.
