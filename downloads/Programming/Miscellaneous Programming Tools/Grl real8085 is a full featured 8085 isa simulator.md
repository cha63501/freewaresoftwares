**Publisher's Description**  
  


GRL Real8085 is a full-featured 8085 ISA simulator produced specifically for college students enrolled in a Computer Architecture (etc.) course. 

GRL Real8085 gives you the power to write 8085-specific ASM without the hindrance of bulky two and three step DOS compilers. With GRL Real8085, you simply enter your ASM using the built-in code editor, and then run your program -- that is all there is to it! GRL Real8085 also contains a built-in code refrence manual, extensive memory access, direct access to simulated CPU state, clear output logs, and more! GRL Real8085 compiles and runs most code sequences in a matter of seconds, and the results are immediately displayed in memory.
