**Publisher's Description**  
  

breve is a free, open-source software package which makes it easy to build 3D
simulations of multi-agent systems and artificial life. Users define the
behaviors of agents in a 3D world and observe how they interact. breve
includes physical simulation and collision detection so you can simulate
realistic creatures, and an OpenGL display engine so you can visualize your
simulated worlds.

breve simulations are written in an easy to use language called steve. The
language is object-oriented and borrows many features from languages such as
C, Perl and Objective C, but even users without previous programming
experience will find it easy to jump in.
