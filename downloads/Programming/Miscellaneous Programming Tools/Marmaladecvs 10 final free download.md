**Publisher's Description**  
  

Free fast CVS client for Windows. It has many small features that makes
working with cvs less painful. The UI is very thought through and everything
is only a click away. Instead of focusing on making UI to cover all existing
cvs functions, I have focused on making the common stuff fast and easily
available.

**Features:**

  * UI fully usable when cvs is working. New invoked cvs commands are put on queue. 
  * Flat-mode with easy filtering (and always showing changed files on top). 
  * One working path (no confusion. All stuff from UI or commandline are done from the current path) 
  * Plain-update (dialog update on separate button). 
  * Internal diffwindow (External can also be used)
