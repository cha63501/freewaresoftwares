**Publisher's Description**  
  

JarBuilder is a useful tool for Java programmers. It allows one to easily
create jar files. It is written in Java providing a nice Swing GUI.

Although JarBuilder isnA't programmed as a classic wizard, java programmers
are able to build their own jar files with JarBuilder in three steps: First
you selected the files you want to include into the jar file, then you can
load or write your manifest file. at least JarBuilder can do an automatic
search for main classes for you and add the correct statement into the
manifest file. finally you select the compression level of the jar file and
then JarBuilder creates the file for you.

As a java developer you can build your jar files manually or with tools like
ant. But if you have small projects JarBuilder can be much more faster than
the other tools. For example, you donA't have to write a manifest file just
for the Main-Class statement.
