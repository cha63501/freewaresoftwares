FX Composer 2.5 is a powerful integrated development environment for shader
authoring.

New features in this release include:

  * Particle systems 
  * Support for the NVIDIA Shader Debugger 
  * Remote control over TCP/IP 
  * Unified Importing of Models

FX Composer has an extensive set of capabilities. These include Shader Library
integration, ShaderPerf analysis, animation support, COLLADA support,
scripting, effect and project wizards, customizable toolbars and layouts, and
much more.
