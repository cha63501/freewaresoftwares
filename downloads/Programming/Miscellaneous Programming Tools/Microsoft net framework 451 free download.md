**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 is a highly compatible, in-place update to
the .NET Framework 4. By using the .NET Framework 4.5 RC together with the C#
or Visual Basic programming languages, you can write Windows Metro style apps.

The .NET Framework 4.5 includes significant language and framework
enhancements for C# and Visual Basic so that you can more easily write
asynchronous code, the blending of control flow in synchronous code, a
responsive UI, and web app scalability.

The .NET Framework 4.5 adds substantial improvements to other functional areas
such as ASP.NET, Managed Extensibility Framework, Windows Communication
Foundation, Windows Workflow Foundation, and Windows Identity Foundation. The
.NET Framework 4.5 Beta delivers better performance, reliability, and
security.

  * Windows Vista (x86 and x64) 
  * Windows 7 (x86 and x64) 
  * Windows 8 Release Preview (x86 and x64)
