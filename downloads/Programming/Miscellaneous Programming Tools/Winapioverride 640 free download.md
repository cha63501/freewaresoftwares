**Publisher's Description**  
  

This software allows you to monitor and/or override any function of a process.
This can be done for API functions or executable internal functions.

WinAPIOverride is more than a standard API monitoring software. It can break
targeted application before or after a function call, allowing memory or
registers changes; and it can directly call functions of the targeted
application.

These features allows to fill the gap between classical API monitoring
softwares and debuggers.

Main differences between over API hooker:

  * You can define filters on parameters or function result 
  * You can define filters on dll to discard calls from windows system dll 
  * You can hook functions inside the target process not only API 
  * You can hook asm functions with parameters passed through registers 
  * Double and float results are logged 
  * You can easily override any API or any process internal function 
  * You can break process before or/and after function call to change memory or registers 
  * You can call functions which are inside the remote processes 
  * All is is done like modules : you can log or override independently for any function
