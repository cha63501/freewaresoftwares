**Publisher's Description**  
  

**BitNami DjangoStack** Native Installer is an easy-to-install environment to develop and deploy Django applications. It includes pre-configured, ready-to-run versions of Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Python and Django so users can get the environment up and running in minutes after answering a few questions. Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems are supported. 

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design. Developed and used over two years by a fast-
moving online-news operation, Django was designed to handle two challenges:
the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the
experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you build high-performing,
elegant Web applications quickly.
