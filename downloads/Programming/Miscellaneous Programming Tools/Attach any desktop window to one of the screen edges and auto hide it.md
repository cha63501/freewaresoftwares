**Publisher's Description**  
  


The program could attach any desktop window to one of the screen edges and auto hide it. (Hidden panels will work like the windows TaskBar). Very useful e.g. adding to the hide list the C++ Builder main window(top), object inspector(left) and project manager(right), makes a lot more editor space on the screen. **HINT!** You can add the active window to the hide list using the predefined **Ctrl+Alt+A** key combination. Also you can let PanelHider window active and use **Alt+A** Hotkey to easily add to the hide list the window under the cursor! Click to the programA's system menu to see settings.
