**Publisher's Description**  
  

Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a Java software development framework that makes
writing AJAX applications like Google Maps and Gmail easy for developers who
donA't speak browser quirks as a second language. Writing dynamic web
applications today is a tedious and error-prone process; you spend 90% of your
time working around subtle incompatabilities between web browsers and
platforms, and JavaScriptA's lack of modularity makes sharing, testing, and
reusing AJAX components difficult and fragile.

GWT lets you avoid many of these headaches while offering your users the same
dynamic, standards-compliant experience. You write your front end in the Java
programming language, and the GWT compiler converts your Java classes to
browser-compliant JavaScript and HTML.

Google Web Toolkit Features

  * Dynamic, reusable UI components 
  * Really simple RPC 
  * Browser history management
