**Publisher's Description**  
  

EZSignIt is a FREE digital code signing program that allows you to easily and
quickly digitally sign one or more files using a code-signing ( authenticode )
certificate that you possess.

It can sign multiple files at 1 time, remembers your last used settings, and
unlike many other solutions, is NOT dependent on any other MS tools! You can
use the GUI or you can digitally sign via the command line.

EZSignIt only works with the newer .PFX or .P12 digital signature format, but
you can easily convert your SPC/PVK files into this format using the supplied
instructions. Code signing has never been easier!

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html).
