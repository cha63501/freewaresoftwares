JMathLib is meant to be a clone of Matlab, but written entirely in java.

A library of mathematical functions designed to be used in evaluating complex
expressions and display the results graphically. It will be used either
interactively through a terminal like window or to interpret script files. It
can be extended very simply with m-files an java classes.

It is intended to be a java version of programs such as MatLab, Octave,
FreeMat and Scilab.
