**Publisher's Description**  
  

Generate is a simple serial telegram simulator that can be used to emulate GPS
receivers and other hardware found offshore.

It simulates fixed or dynamic values for pitch, roll, heading, latitude,
longitude and depth. It then uses these values to create a serial telegram
that is sent on the selected comms port. For example, generate can be used to
send a $GPGGA telegram instead of a GPS unit to allow testing of software.

Multiple copies of the program can be started to simulate multiple inputs.

It currently supports 24 different serial telegram formats as follows:

  * $GPGGA 
  * $GPGLL 
  * $GPZDA 
  * $SONDEP 
  * $PSSIROV 
  * $DBS 
  * $PRDID 
  * $HCHDM 
  * $HEHDT 
  * $PSXN23 
  * TSS 1 
  * EM1000 
  * EM3000 
  * Robertson 
  * SG Brown 
  * SGB ASCII 
  * Pisces ROV 
  * UTC 
  * DVL PD5 
  * MDL2 
  * CDL1 
  * Digilog 
  * Meridian 
  * MiniPos1 
  * $SDDPT 
  * Custom 
  * Replay 
The custom telegram type allows the user to create an ASCII or binary
telegram. If replay is selected then the program will read ASCII telegrams
from a file outputting them at the defined interval looping round the file
infinitely. This allows data from an instrument to be recorded through a
terminal program and then replayed through generate.
