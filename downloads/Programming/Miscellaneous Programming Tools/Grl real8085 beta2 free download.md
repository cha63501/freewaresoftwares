**Publisher's Description**  
  

GRL Real8085 is a full-featured 8085 ISA simulator produced specifically for
college students enrolled in a Computer Architecture (etc.) course.

GRL Real8085 gives you the power to write 8085-specific ASM without the
hindrance of bulky two and three step DOS compilers. With GRL Real8085, you
simply enter your ASM using the built-in code editor, and then run your
program -- that is all there is to it! GRL Real8085 also contains a built-in
code refrence manual, extensive memory access, direct access to simulated CPU
state, clear output logs, and more! GRL Real8085 compiles and runs most code
sequences in a matter of seconds, and the results are immediately displayed in
memory.
