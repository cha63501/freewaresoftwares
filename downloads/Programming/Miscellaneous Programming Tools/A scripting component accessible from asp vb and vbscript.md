**Publisher's Description**  
  


ASPImage is a scripting component accessible from ASP, VB, and VBScript. Because it is "ASP-aware", it can output images directly to the ASP response stream. ASPImage offers some simple image manipulations which can be very handy when preparing web photo galleries. ASPImage can either save its output to files or send content directly to a browser (when invoked from ASP scripts). 

You can use ASPImage to:

  * Create thumbnails dynamically 
  * Add logos to images 
  * Add copyright or any other captioning to images 
  * Reduce image dimensions to any desired size
