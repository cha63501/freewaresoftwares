**Publisher's Description**  
  


Free disassembler version of the Dis# .NET decompiler.  
Unlike other diassemblers Dis# produces code of pseudo assembler (pasm). Pasm intends to view, not to compile. ItA's main differences of IL assembler are: 

  * C# language style method titles. 
  * Only significant part of IL code presents. 
  * Only those assembler instructions have labels, which are really targets of the branches. Labels have numerical orders. 
  * Exception of nonsignificant instructions (such as endfinally).
