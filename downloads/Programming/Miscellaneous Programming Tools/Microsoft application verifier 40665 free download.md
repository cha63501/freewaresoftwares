**Publisher's Description**  
  

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool for unmanaged code that
assists in quickly finding subtle programming errors that can be extremely
difficult to identify with normal application testing.

Application Verifier is designed specifically to detect and help debug memory
corruptions and critical security vulnerabilities. It makes it easier to
create reliable applications by monitoring an applicationA's interaction with
the Windows operating system, profiling its use of objects, the registry, the
file system, and Win32 APIs (including heaps, handles, locks, and more). It
also includes checks to predict how well the application will perform under
Least-privileged User Account operation, compatibility tests to be used in
logoing, and print tests to verify your usage of the print subsystem.

Running Application Verifier is easy; simply turn on the tool then run your
project and go through your normal testing scenarios. When your tests are
completed, view the Application Verifier logs for any errors that may have
been detected.
