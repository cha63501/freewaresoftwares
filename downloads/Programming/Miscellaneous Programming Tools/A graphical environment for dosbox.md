**Publisher's Description**  
  


D-Fend Reloaded is a graphical environment for DOSBox. DOSBox emulates a complete computer including the DOS commandline and allows to run nearly all old DOS based games on modern hardware with any of the newer Windows versions. 

With DOSBox there is no need to worry about memory managers or free conventional RAM, but the setup of DOSBox is still a bit complicated. The configuration of DOSBox via textbased setup files might be difficult for beginners. D-Fend Reloaded may help and create these files for you. Additionally the D-Fend Reloaded installation package contains DOSBox (including all lanuage files currently available), so there is only one installation to be run and no need to link D-Fend Reloaded with DOSBox manually. 

**WhatA's New in version 1.3.6:**

  * Updated Danisch, French, French Canada, German, Italian und Polish language files. 
  * Updated Italian DOSBox language file. 
  * Updated DOSZip from 2.50 to 3.21. 
  * Better filtering of game notes text in game information reader. 
  * [Fix] Changing to the game directory is not working on some newer DOSBox CVN version if using PhysFS or archive file based drive mounts. 
  * [Fix] Line breaks created in the program notes field due to breaking the text on the right window side are not stored anymore as line breaks. 
  * [Fix] Until now not the same saved games where visible when running a ScummVM based game via D-Fend Reloaded and via plain ScummVM.
