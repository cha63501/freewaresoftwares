**Publisher's Description**  
  


PhpClassView is a standalone classbrowser and documentation-tool for PHP-Classes. 

PhpClassView creates and displays documentations for php-classes on the fly from appropriate source files. It also can be used to generate static documentations in HTML-format for classbased PHP-projects.

It comes along with a build-in filebrowser, supports drag&drop and uses tabs to display the classdocs. 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-20-x86-Final_program_16026.html). 

**WhatA's new in version 0.3.7:**

  * Added support for inline-links in phpdoc-comments ({@link ...}) 
  * A user-dialog A'Do you want to open the PHP-classes from your last session?A' showing up after starting phpclassview was added (together with the corresponding functionality) 
  * Global/uncategorized project-classes (that donA't belong to any package or category) now appear under a new section A'Global/uncategorized classesA' in generated project-documentations. 
  * Some slight visual modifications were applied to the look of class- and project-documentations. 
  * Overall performance of the generation of static HTML-documentations was increased. 
  * Added a button A'open generated documentationA' that appears after a HTML-documentation was generated. 
  * The overall performance of the TAB-control was increased significantly (especially when a lot of tabs/classes get opened) 
  * HTML-links used in classdoc-comments get displayed in generated documentations now. 
  * Bugfix: When the first tab in tabrow was closed, the classdocumentation assotiated with that tab still was shown (while the next tab in the row was selected). 
  * Bugfix: The monitor for detecting filesystem-changes that is used for the FileBrowser sometimes crashed on SMB-network-drives hosted by linux-systems 
  * Bugfix: A'return-by-referenceA'-methods are recognized and displayed correctly now in class-documentations. 
  * Bugfix: Signatures of abstract methods with leading A'abstractA'-keyword (like A'abstract funcion foo()A') are recognized as such correctly now. 
  * Bugfix: Doc-comments without any short or long description but with A'@A'-doctags get parsed correctly now. 
  * Bugfix: When a new drive was added to the filesystem (i.e. USB or network-drive), previously expanded nodes in the filebrowser couldnA't get collapsed/closed anymore before the the new drive appeared or disappeared. 
  * Bugfix: Doc-comments beginning with an empty line get parsed correctly now.
