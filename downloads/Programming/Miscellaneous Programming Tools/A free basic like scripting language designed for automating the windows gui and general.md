**Publisher's Description**  
  


AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI. It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys). 

AutoIt was initially designed for PC "roll out" situations to configure thousands of PCs, but with the arrival of v3 it is also well suited to performing home automation and the scripting of repetitive tasks.

**Features:**

  * Easy to learn BASIC-like syntax 
  * Simulate keystrokes and mouse movements 
  * Manipulate windows and processes 
  * Interact with all standard windows controls 
  * Scripts can be compiled into standalone executables 
  * Create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) 
  * COM support 
  * Regular expressions 
  * Directly call external DLL and Windows API functions 
  * Scriptable RunAs functions 
  * Detailed helpfile and large community-based support forums 
  * Compatible with Windows 95 / 98 / ME / NT4 / 2000 / XP / 2003 / Vista / 2008 / 7 / 8 
  * Unicode and x64 support 
  * Digitally signed for peace of mind 
  * Works with Windows Vista's User Account Control (UAC)
