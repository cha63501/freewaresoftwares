**Publisher's Description**  
  

ReadyConvert helps litigation support teams by quickly and accurately
verifying their product deliverables. It lets the user view full page images,
metadata and thumbnails side by side. Navigation is made easy through the
document grid while seamlessly keeping all views synced.

Using ReadyConvert, the litigation support professional can convert load files
to and from standard industry formats, including EDRM XML. For example,
ReadyConvert allows the user to import an Opticon-based load file with a
Concordance delimited metadata file. These imported documents can then be
exported to a Summation DII load file, allowing the user to specify metadata
tokens on export.

**Features:**

  * Convert load files from one format to another, including EDRM XML 
  * Extract metadata from load files 
  * Verify load file integrity, ensuring referenced files exist 
  * Generate load files from single or multi page image folders 
  * View images, thumbnails and metadata side-by-side 
  * Generate cross reference reports with custom fields 
  * Filter load files using custom search criteria 
  * Batch update or find/replace on metadata fields
