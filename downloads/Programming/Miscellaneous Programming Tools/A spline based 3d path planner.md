**Publisher's Description**  
  


3D path planning allows the generation of motion paths for your game, animation, or robot. Calculates target velocities, accelerations, forces, and times for any point along the target path. You can also define rotations. Uses cubic splines, you define the start and end position data, rotation data, etc. 

Easy to use animation classes allow you to use the generated path and retrieve a position for the current time. You can export a text file describing the curve.
