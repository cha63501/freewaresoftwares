**Publisher's Description**  
  


Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a Java software development framework that makes writing AJAX applications like Google Maps and Gmail easy for developers who donA't speak browser quirks as a second language. Writing dynamic web applications today is a tedious and error-prone process; you spend 90% of your time working around subtle incompatabilities between web browsers and platforms, and JavaScriptA's lack of modularity makes sharing, testing, and reusing AJAX components difficult and fragile. 

GWT lets you avoid many of these headaches while offering your users the same dynamic, standards-compliant experience. You write your front end in the Java programming language, and the GWT compiler converts your Java classes to browser-compliant JavaScript and HTML.

Google Web Toolkit Features 

  * Dynamic, reusable UI components 
  * Really simple RPC 
  * Browser history management 
  * Real debugging 
  * Browser compatible 
  * Interoperability and fine-grained control
