**Publisher's Description**  
  

Greenfoot is an integrated development environment that makes it easy to write
games and simulations in the Java Programming Language. It comes with a broad
range of demo scenarios and documentation that gets newcomers started very
quickly. Greenfoot may be used to learn or teach programming, or just to put a
cool game up on a website. (Yes, Greenfoot can export the game to a web page!)
Originally developed for school age learners, but now used by all age groups.

Consider greenfoot as a combination between a framework for creating two-
dimensional grid assignments in Java and an integrated development environment
(class browser, editor, compiler, execution, etc.) suitable for novice
programmers. While greenfoot supports the full Java language, it is especially
useful for programming exercises that has a visual element. In greenfoot
object visualisation and object interaction are the key elements.

If you know BlueJ and a microworld framework (like Karel the Robot or the AP
Marine Biology Case Study) consider greenfoot as the best from both: object
interaction (BlueJ) and object visualisation (microworlds).
