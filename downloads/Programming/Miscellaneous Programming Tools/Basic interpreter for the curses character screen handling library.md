**Publisher's Description**  
  


BASIC interpreter for the curses character screen handling library which fully corresponds to the Tiny BASIC specification. 

To put it simply, this is the simplest programming language which still enables to do many things. Tiny BASIC was a small simple BASIC for old microcomputers which had a very small memory. This interpreter enables to do everything which Tiny BASIC enabled to do on these old microcomputers, and what was usually done with it. Includes interactive environment and renumbering lines. Good for writing simple games, rewriting old BASIC games, and in a way such BASIC is itself a game.

Easy to be extended by these who can do the programming in C. The code is small (only 1500 lines) and well structured. It is also thread-safe and can be embedded in other programs, so the modified versions of it can be used for many different purposes.

Binaries for Windows (win2k and newer) and Linux (Ubuntu, etc) are included. Source code is also included. In Linux the ncurses library must be installed (aptitude install libncurses5-dev), there are no special requirements for Windows. There is no deb package at the time of writing this, but the package is ready to be debianized. Should also run in other platforms such as Macintosh and DOS, as well as in mobile platforms, but must be compiled for these platforms.
