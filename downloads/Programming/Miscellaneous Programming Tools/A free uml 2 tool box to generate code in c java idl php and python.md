**Publisher's Description**  
  


BOUML is a free UML 2 tool box allowing you to specify and generate code in C++, Java, Idl, Php and Python. 

BOUML runs under Unix/Linux/Solaris, MacOS X(Power PC and Intel) and Windows.

BOUML is very fast and doesnA't require much memory to manage several thousands of classes.

BOUML is extensible, and the external tools named plug-outs can be written in C++ or Java, using BOUML for their definition as any other program. The code generators and reverses are ones of the pre-defined plug-outs included in the BOUML distribution.

**Features:**

  * it is free 
  * it runs under Linux/Unix/Solaris, Mac OS X and Windows thanks to Qt 
  * it allows to program simultaneously in C++, Java, Php, Python and IDL 
  * thanks to a full access to the generated forms, you are the master and you decide what must be generated 
  * it is extensible, and the external tools (I name them plug-outs because they are executed outside BOUML) may be developed in C++ or Java, using BOUML for their definition as any other program. Frankly I do not like very much language like Visual Basic, and I do not understand how this one can be imposed in a UML environment ! 
  * it is very fast and doesnA't require much memory to manage several thousands of classes 
Downloads for other supported operating systems are available at the [developerA's website](http://bouml.sourceforge.net/).
