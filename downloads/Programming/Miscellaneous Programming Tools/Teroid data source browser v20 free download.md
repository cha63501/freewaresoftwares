**Publisher's Description**  
  

Teroid Data Source Browser is a tree control containing the schema
(tables/views and their columns) of any data source for which an OLE DB
provider is present on the target machine. The control can take a connection
string, a connection or an ADO .NET DataSet as the data source, and raises an
event when a table/view or column is selected. The screenshot illustrates the
control with the data source set to the Northwind database on SQL Server. This
version is freeware and as with all Teroid Software products requires the
Microsoft .NET CLR.
