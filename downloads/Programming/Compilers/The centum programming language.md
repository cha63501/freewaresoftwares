**Publisher's Description**  
  


Centum is an interpreted language that was designed to be used on computers running some version of windows. Our mascot is Minimus (a meerkat, not a dog). It is intended to be a language that makes it easy to express algorithms in, as well as one that helps relieve the programmer of menial work. All data handling is done by external modules (i.e. dll files) both in order to enforce this philosophy and to keep more of the execution time outside of interpreted code, which is by nature slow. CentumA's design is very flexible, so it is easy to add new functionality to the language in the form of new loaders, file formats, objects, and control structures. Hopefully this will allow the language to grow with its users.
