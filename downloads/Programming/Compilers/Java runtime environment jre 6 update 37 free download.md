Java software allows you to run applications called 'applets' that are written
in the Java programming language. These applets allow you to play online
games, chat with people around the world, calculate your mortgage interest,
and view images in 3D. Corporations also use applets for intranet applications
and e-business solutions.

The J2SE Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows end-users to run Java
