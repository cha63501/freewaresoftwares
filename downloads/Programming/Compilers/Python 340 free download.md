Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

It features modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types,
and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries,
as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC).

New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as
