**Publisher's Description**  
  


NaaLaa is an easy to learn BASIC style programming language that compiles to standalone Windows executables and Java applets for the web. ItA's meant for those who wants to get started with game programming. 

NaaLaa is an interpreted language. But the actual interpreter (around 200 kB in size) is invisible as itA's baked into every program that you compile.

As NaaLaa uses software routines for all graphics rendering your programs will not require DirectX or OpenGL to run.

Audiere is used for sound and music.

Your programs may consist of multiple source files. You can create libraries that can be imported into any project, and you can swap execution between completely separated program units.
