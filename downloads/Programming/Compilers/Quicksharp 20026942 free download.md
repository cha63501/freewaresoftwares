**Publisher's Description**  
  

QuickSharp is a minimalist C# IDE for Microsoft .NET Framework. It includes a
sophisticated code editor with code completion, syntax coloring and code-
folding, built-in compile and run, and support for ASP.NET and SQL Server,
MySQL and SQLite databases.

**Features:**

  * create source code with the built-in editor featuring syntax colouring, code-folding and Visual Studio-style docking windows, 
  * get instant lookup of class and namespace members using Code Assist, 
  * compile programs from within QuickSharp; warnings and errors appear in the output window for instant location within the editor, 
  * build EXE and DLL files automatically; no need to configure the compiler target, 
  * run programs directly from the editor and capture the output in QuickSharp's Output window or run in a separate window for interactive use, 
  * use 'embedded' file options to control compilation and runtime behaviour; run shell-based commands at all stages of the build process to perform related tasks, 
  * perform simple file management tasks from the Workspace such as opening, renaming and deleting files and folders, 
  * add additional build tool configurations, including Mono and older Microsoft compilers, 
  * compile intermediate language and XML resource files from within QuickSharp using the built-in ilasm and resgen integration, 
  * use Find in Files to search files in the Workspace, 
  * use the Regular Expression Helper to develop regular expressions, 
  * explore the .NET Framework with the Object Browser, 
  * develop your own features and enhancements using QuickSharp's plugin architecture. 
QuickSharp includes all you need to write, compile and run programs for the
Microsoft .NET platform using the C# programming language. It provides a
simple but complete integrated development environment (IDE) for Microsoft
Windows 7, Vista and XP.

QuickSharp works with [Microsoft .NET Framework
3.5](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-NET-Framework-
3_program_31320.html); if you're a Windows 7 user you already have everything
you need. XP and Vista users may need to download the latest version.
