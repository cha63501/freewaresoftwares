**Publisher's Description**  
  

TKS is a rather lightweight script language for portable multimedia
applications. It has a JavaScript/C++ like syntax and can handle user defined
classes.

TKS has bindings for OpenGL1.1, SDL, SDL_net, png, jpeg, MySQL, collision
detection, TTF loading and soon OggVorbis. You can create portable ".tkx"
files which can be started from web pages or other documents.

A JIT compiler can partially create native (and very fast) code (especially
for inner loops) and an inline assembler can be used to directly program the
x86 FPU, a subset of the X86 CPU as well as the TKS-VM p-code.

TKS can be used for video games, demos, Web3D applications and even for
server-side text (and soom XML) processing.
