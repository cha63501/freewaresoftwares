**Publisher's Description**  
  

EiffelStudio is a full-featured IDE for the Eiffel programming language.

**Features:**

  * Complete compiler for the Eiffel programming language, with both high compile-time speed and high-performance executables 
  * Support for Windows, MacOS X, Linux, *BSD, Solaris and other operating systems 
  * Smart code editor 
  * Sophisticated multi-view browsing and viewing facilities 
  * Interactive debugger 
  * Graphical modelling tool for UML and BON with full roundtrip 
  * Refactoring support 
  * GUI development tool and fully portable GUI library 
The Eiffel compiler creates C code that is then handed to a standard C
compiler. As a result, Eiffel programs have a run-time performance comparable
to those directly written in C or C++. At the same time, Eiffel is an object-
oriented and strongly typed language. EiffelStudio uses a highly efficient
compacting garbage collector to free the developer from the burden of memory
management.
