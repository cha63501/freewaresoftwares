**Publisher's Description**  
  

TempleOS (formerly LoseThos) is an x86_64, multi-tasking, multi-cored, public
domain, open source, ring-0-only, single-address-map (identity-mapped), non-
networked, PC operating system for recreational programming. It brings back
the good things from when computers were simple and owners programmed them.

TempleOS is modern, using all 16 CPU 64-bit registers. TempleOS also makes it
easy for hobbiests to make games. TempleOS is a supplemental O.S., meaning you
will use another operating system as your primary one because you canA't
access the Internet and with the simplifications, there are no protections
preventing crashes when you make mistakes. Removing protections, however,
makes it fast.

Supports MultiCore. Best command-line on the planet, allowing links and
graphics to be output from programs to the command line. One document format
for source code, help, menuA's, forms, command line which supports graphics,
macroA's, links, trees and more, seamlessly supported by clipboard, compiler
and tools. Open source including everything.

This download is an .ISO file which needs to be burned to CD/DVD. You can boot
it directly or run it in VMware or VirtualBox aiming the CD/DVD drive at
TempleOSCD.ISO.
