Qt is a cross-platform development framework that developers can use to save
their development time while they become more effective. They can easily
target all relevant operating systems using a single code base so they can
reach a wider customer base within the shortest time possible. It is ideal for
professional software development irrespective of the size of a project. You
can use it for efficient profiling, direct device deployment,
internationalization and UI design.

**Features:**

  * Compatible with all platforms 
  * Provides extended functionality 
  * Professional tooling 
  * Flexible commercial licensing 
The extended functionalities that Qt Enterprise provides include:

  * Charts make it easy to create different types of charts 
  * Data Visualization allows users to create 3D visualizations in a matter of minutes 
  * Quick Enterprise Controls provides advanced UI controls that suit industry-specific requirements 
  * Enterprise Tooling gives designers optimal solutions for delivering high-quality applications 
  * Virtual Keyboard for embedded devices, especially those with touch-screen user interfaces. The virtual keyboard is customizable 

**Using Qt**

Although Qt is a large file, it provides one installation package that we
found relatively easy to install. It provided us with a complete tool chain
for all aspects of application development, including designing, building and
debugging.

Considering the numerous operating systems available today, developers will
appreciate an IDE that allows them to customize their products for all
relevant systems. Qt allows designers to reuse code efficiently so they can
deploy their applications on different processor architectures and operating
systems.

Qt uses modular C++ class library and developer tools that allow designers to
recompile their code from one source tree. This makes it easy to produce
applications for different operating systems or versions of the same OS.

Qt allowed us to use our preferred settings, including fonts, colors and
sounds. Its powerful style engine allowed us to either implement our styles or
modify existing ones. We were able to preserve the native look and feel on
each supported platform.

We enjoyed a seamless workflow, thanks to QtAs professional tooling. In
addition, we had the option to use the frameworkAs cloud-based services to
facilitate all aspects of creating applications. It took us only minutes to
set up our cloud storage and connect our apps with Qt APIs. The storage, which
has built-in scaling, is ideal for backup and disaster recovery.

**Verdict**

Qt provides a complete application development framework that allows
developers to build efficient applications with beautiful and user-friendly
interfaces. It simplifies the development of cross-platform applications
without having to re-invent the wheel.
