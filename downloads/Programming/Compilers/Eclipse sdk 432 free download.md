**Publisher's Description**  
  

Eclipse is an open source platform-independent software framework for
delivering what the project calls or is known as "rich-client applications"
(as opposed to "thin clients", this means the clients perform heavy-duty work
on the host running the application).

So far this framework has typically been used to develop IDEs (Integrated
Development Environments), such as the highly-regarded Java IDE called Java
Development Toolkit (JDT) and compiler that come as part of Eclipse (and which
are also used to develop Eclipse itself). However, it can be used for other
types of client application as well, see the popular BitTorrent client Azureus
for example.

Eclipse was originally developed by IBM, but is now developed by the Eclipse
Foundation, an independent not-for-profit consortium of software industry
vendors. Many notable software tool vendors have embraced Eclipse as a future
framework for their IDEs, among them Borland and IBM Rational.
