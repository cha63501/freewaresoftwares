Qt is a cross-platform development framework that developers can use to save their development time while they become more effective. They can easily target all relevant operating systems using a single code base so they can reach a wider customer base within the shortest time possible. It is ideal for professional software development irrespective of the size of a project. You can use it for efficient profiling, direct device deployment, internationalization and UI design. 

**Features:**

  * Compatible with all platforms 
  * Provides extended functionality 
  * Professional tooling 
  * Flexible commercial licensing 
The extended functionalities that Qt Enterprise provides include: 
  * Charts make it easy to create different types of charts 
  * Data Visualization allows users to create 3D visualizations in a matter of minutes 
  * Quick Enterprise Controls provides advanced UI controls that suit industry-specific requirements 
  * Enterprise Tooling gives designers optimal solutions for delivering high-quality applications 
  * Virtual Keyboard for embedded devices, especially those with touch-screen user interfaces. The virtual keyboard is customizable 

**Using Qt**

Although Qt is a large file, it provides one installation package that we found relatively easy to install. It provided us with a complete tool chain for all aspects of application development, including designing, building and debugging.

Considering the numerous operating systems available today, developers will appreciate an IDE that allows them to customize their products for all relevant systems. Qt allows designers to reuse code efficiently so they can deploy their applications on different processor architectures and operating systems.

Qt uses modular C++ class library and developer tools that allow designers to recompile their code from one source tree. This makes it easy to produce applications for different operating systems or versions of the same OS.

Qt allowed us to use our preferred settings, including fonts, colors and sounds. Its powerful style engine allowed us to either implement our styles or modify existing ones. We were able to preserve the native look and feel on each supported platform.

We enjoyed a seamless workflow, thanks to QtAs professional tooling. In addition, we had the option to use the frameworkAs cloud-based services to facilitate all aspects of creating applications. It took us only minutes to set up our cloud storage and connect our apps with Qt APIs. The storage, which has built-in scaling, is ideal for backup and disaster recovery.

**Verdict**

Qt provides a complete application development framework that allows developers to build efficient applications with beautiful and user-friendly interfaces. It simplifies the development of cross-platform applications without having to re-invent the wheel.
