TempleOS (formerly LoseThos) is an x86_64, multi-tasking, multi-cored, public domain, open source, ring-0-only, single-address-map (identity-mapped), non-networked, PC operating system for recreational programming. It brings back the good things from when computers were simple and owners programmed them. 

TempleOS is modern, using all 16 CPU 64-bit registers. TempleOS also makes it easy for hobbiests to make games. TempleOS is a supplemental O.S., meaning you will use another operating system as your primary one because you canA't access the Internet and with the simplifications, there are no protections preventing crashes when you make mistakes. Removing protections, however, makes it fast.

One document format for source code, help, menuA's, forms, command line which supports graphics, macroA's, links, trees and more, seamlessly supported by clipboard, compiler and tools. Open source including everything.
