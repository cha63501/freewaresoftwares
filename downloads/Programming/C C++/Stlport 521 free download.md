**Publisher's Description**  
  

STLport is a multiplatform C++ Standard Library implementation. It is a free,
open-source product, featuring the following:

  * Standard (ISO/IEC 14882) compliance; 
  * Advanced techniques and optimizations for maximum efficiency; 
  * Exception safety and thread safety; 
  * Important extensions---hash tables, singly-linked list, rope; 
  * Power debug mode---run time check of the correctness of iterators and containers usage. 
STLport works on any platform possible and proves itself as a seamless drop-in
for modern production environments. Not only that---it also offers important
functionality not provided by any other standard library vendor:

  * Debug mode: "Safe iterators" and preconditions with rigorous runtime validity checking; 
  * Immediately reports STL bugs undetectable otherwise; 
  * Wide range of configuration knobs to fit particular requirements of your project, including use in embedded systems, such as vxWorks or Windows CE.
