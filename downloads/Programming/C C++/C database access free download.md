**Publisher's Description**  
  

One of the products Terimber Corporation offers is the high-performance C++
Database access with an identical client interface for ODBC and ORACLE
database servers. Database access internally incapsulates (ODBC, ORACLE) APIs
and provides an identical server independent interface.

Database access provides synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous(non-blocking)
SQL statement executing and data fetching. All SQL statements as well as
stored procedures can be accomplished with parameters. All asynchronous
requests can be interrupted by user at any time.
