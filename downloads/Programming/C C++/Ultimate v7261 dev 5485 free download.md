**Publisher's Description**  
  

U++ is a C++ cross-platform rapid application development framework focused on
programmers productivity. It includes a set of libraries (GUI, SQL, etc..),
and an integrated development environment.

Rapid development is achieved by the smart and aggressive use of C++ rather
than through fancy code generators. In this respect, U++ competes with popular
scripting languages while preserving C/C++ runtime characteristics.

The U++ integrated development environment, TheIDE, introduces modular
concepts to C++ programming. It features BLITZ-build technology to speedup C++
rebuilds up to 4 times, Visual designers for U++ libraries, Topic++ system for
documenting code and creating rich text resources for applications (like help
and code documentation) and Assist++ - a powerful C++ code analyzer that
provides features like code completion, navigation and transformation.

TheIDE can work with GCC, MinGW and Visual C++ 9.0 as contained in free
Windows Vista SDK and contains a full featured debugger. TheIDE can also be
used to develop non-U++ applications.

Downloads also available for Linux, Unix, BSD, etc. at the [developerA's
website](http://www.ultimatepp.org/).
