**Publisher's Description**  
  

Easystructure is a tool to analyze C source files and display the structure of
the source code in flowchart and hierarchical tree views. The tree view is a
vertical display version of the Jackson block graphical methodology. Once the
source has been parsed these views can be browsed/copied/printed to gain an
understanding of the code. Flowcharts are displayed with the original source.
A tree node may be expanded so as to show any contained statements of various
types (e.g. jump type, return type). When parsed the source may be reformatted
(beautified) according to the many options. The views can be printed, copied,
or displayed with the original source.

The flowchart view may be printed or copied to the clipboard in wmf format.
The flowchart appearance can be customised ,e.g. block size, font size,
margins.

The tree view may be printed or copied to the clipboard in wmf format (the
page dimensions can be set when copying). These are in the treeA's current
expanded state. An option exists for each tree node to include itA's
associated lines of original source. This is useful for documentation purposes
or where you want to include the source comments.
