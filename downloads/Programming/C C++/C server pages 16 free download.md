**Publisher's Description**  
  

C++ Server Pages (CSP) allows developers to build Dynamic Web Pages and Web
Applications by using C++.

Existing C++ projects can be ported to the Web by simply including the C++
source code, or by importing the C++ libraries to CSP scripts.

It is similar to ASP and JSP, but instead of VBScript, JScript, or Java it
uses C++, giving an incredibly high processing performance to your web
applications. It supports automatic script compilation and provides the
developer with a complete Web programming framework.  
  
It works both with IIS and Apache.
