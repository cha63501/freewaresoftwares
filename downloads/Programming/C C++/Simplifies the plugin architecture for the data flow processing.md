**Publisher's Description**  
  


The FxEngine is a C++ Framework which simplifies the plugin architecture for the data flow processing. It provides a full control to the plugin architecture for applications that require custom solutions. 

With the Framework, you can create your own plugins to support your data format and custom processing. 

The Framework can be used in several application areas such as: 

  * Signal Processing 
  * Image Processing 
  * Test and Measurement 
  * Financial Processing 
  * Control systems Design 

Several types of plugin (also called Fx) can be created: Source, Process, Splitter, Analyser, Mixer and Renderer.

When Fxs are created, the Framework allows to link them and to create sophisticated architectures through a high level API.
