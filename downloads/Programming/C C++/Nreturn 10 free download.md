**Publisher's Description**  
  

Nreturn is a utility that helps detect functions in C Source code that have
multiple exit paths. These are functions which create maintenance risk for the
project where minor modifications need disproportionate verification effort.

Nreturn could also be used to list C functions that have too many while loops
in them. Such a list when reviewed could expose nested while loops in the
project. Invoking functions in nested while loops is often considered a risk
to meeting Execution deadlines like petting Watchdog and scheduling latencies
in Non-premptive systems.

Another typical use of Nreturn is to list all those functions that invoke a
particular function (say an inline delay routine or semaphore lock). Such a
list when maintained for every Release of the project would give a good
control over unexpected growth of critical code in the project.

Nreturn is a Windows console application / Command line program and requires
32-bit version of Windows 2000 or Windows XP.

To generate Excel Workbook reports from Nreturn, Microsoft Excel should be
already installed in the PC.

Nreturn is free for personal use.
