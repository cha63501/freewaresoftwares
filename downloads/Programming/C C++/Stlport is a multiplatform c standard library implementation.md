STLport is a multiplatform C++ Standard Library implementation. It is a free, open-source product, featuring the following: 

  * Standard (ISO/IEC 14882) compliance; 
  * Advanced techniques and optimizations for maximum efficiency; 
  * Exception safety and thread safety; 
  * Important extensions---hash tables, singly-linked list, rope;
