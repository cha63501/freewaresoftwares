**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Class Parts Report is an easy to use windows form that generates 2 reports
from the VB project/classes the user loads.

  1. A Text report of filtered and sorted class symbols (functions, subs, structures, class variables, etc) and 
  2. A Hierarchical tree diagram of inherited classes. 
These reports allows developers to analyze code from a broader, more general
perspective. There are also well documented help screens with easy to follow
instructions and images.

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com
/Microsoft-NET-Framework-4_program_55008.html).
