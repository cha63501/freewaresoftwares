**Publisher's Description**  
  


We have released SQL Connection String Builder .NET Control. This control is designed for situations where you need your user to enter their own SQL connection info. It has 4 textboxes and labels for Data Source, Initial Catalog, User ID and Password. You can pass in a full connection string and it will parse out the elements and display them in the proper field or you can let the user populate the data and pull out a valid connection string using the .ConnectionString property. The connection string will be properly formated with the correct SQL syntax. The password field is masked to the end user.
