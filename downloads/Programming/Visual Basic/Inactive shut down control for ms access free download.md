**Publisher's Description**  
  

Inactive Shut Down Control is a hidden MS Access form that can be opened in
your application to keep track of periods of user inactivity. When the period
of inactivity exceeds a specified limit, a warning message appears, and the
application shuts down.

It is easy to use, just import a form into your application, set the period of
inactivity before shut down, and open the form in hidden mode from your
application startup procedure.
