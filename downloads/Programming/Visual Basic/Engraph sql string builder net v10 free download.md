**Publisher's Description**  
  

We have released SQL Connection String Builder .NET Control. This control is
designed for situations where you need your user to enter their own SQL
connection info. It has 4 textboxes and labels for Data Source, Initial
Catalog, User ID and Password. You can pass in a full connection string and it
will parse out the elements and display them in the proper field or you can
let the user populate the data and pull out a valid connection string using
the .ConnectionString property. The connection string will be properly
formated with the correct SQL syntax. The password field is masked to the end
user.
