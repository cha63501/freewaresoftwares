**Publisher's Description**  
  

Blueshell Error Guy : you really need it.If you have any calls to user-defined
functions or subs in your code (have you ever seen another program?), you need
to be very aware of this feature of Visual BasicA's error handlers; it can
cause control to unexpectedly jump into your calling procedureA's error
handler.

Blueshell Error Guy is a software that allows you detect error mines.

And if there isnA't a calling procedure (as in all event handler subs like
Form_Load, OK_Click etc.) your application will abort immediately. For this
reason, we can only recommend that you include an error handler in at least
every event handler procedure in your application.
