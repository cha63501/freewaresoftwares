**Publisher's Description**  
  

Debug Inspector TM is a Visual StudioA(r) Extension (on Visual Studio Gallery)
and a standalone exe that allows you to view the call stacks of multiple
threads at the same time, plugs in to the internals of the CLR and
automatically detects deadlocks. BETA standalone for unmanaged native deadlock
detection.

It allows you to see exactly what the CLR is doing under the hood and shows,
for each thread, the monitors owned and the monitor waited on, if any.

**Multiple Threads**  
Browse Multiple threadA's call stacks at the same time. No more switching
threads using the threads window.

**Automatic Deadlock Detection**  
If thereA's a deadlock, it will appear in the deadlocks node. No more trawling
through call stack and autos windows to find those pesky critters hiding away.

**Wait and Owned**  
See which objects your thread owns, and which object you are waiting on.

**CLR Stack Frames, as CLR reports them**  
See the actual internal CLR Stack frames and frame types as the CLR stores
them.

**Context Menu**  
Choose from Hexidecimal display, Module names, Line numbers and byte offsets.

**Go to Code, Go to Disassembly**  
Double click on the stack frame and go to the line of code, if available, or
the JIT disassembly of the method.

Debug InspectorTM Version 1.0.0.0 works on both Visual Studio 2005 and Visual
Studio 2008, although for Visual Studio 2005 you will need to install the .Net
Framework 3.5.
