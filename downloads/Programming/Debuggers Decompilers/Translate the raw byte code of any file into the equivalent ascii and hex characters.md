**Publisher's Description**  
  


This application has one purpose - to translate the raw byte code of ANY file (and we mean ANY file) into the equivalent ASCII and HEX characters; and display them. 

Have you ever been faced with a file which you know has a structure, but even if you opened it in a text or hex editor, it still doesnA't make sense? Typically these are system and data files developed over years by in-house programmers. Or they may be client files which you have been asked to read and extract the data.

Inevitably you will need to climb into the actual data and see for yourself. ThatA's what this program allows you to do. And since you can print the results you can also draw, write, or even doodle over the results without damaging the original.

All it requires is a file to examine and a text editor to display the results.

New functionality includes Explorer integration and a most recently used file list.

Installation is as simple as extracting the downloaded zip file to a convenient folder. To uninstall the application, simply delete the folder, thatA's all there is to it!

A help file is included to walk you through using the program.
