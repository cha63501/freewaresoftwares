**Publisher's Description**  
  

**BitNami Trac Stack** Native Installer is an easy-to-install distribution of the Trac application.

Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems are supported. 

Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development
projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project
management.The projectA's mission is to help developers write great software
while staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a
teamA's established development process and policies. It provides an interface
to Subversion, an integrated Wiki and convenient reporting facilities. Trac
allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, creating links
and seamless references between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki pages.
A timeline shows all project events in order, making the acquisition of an
overview of the project and tracking progress very easy.

Here are some key features of the BitNami Stacks Native Installers:

**Easy to Install:**  
BitNami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as possible
to install open source software. Our installers completely automate the
process of installing and configuring all of the software included in each
Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

**Independent:**  
BitNami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere
with any software already installed on your system.

**Integrated:**  
By the time you click the A'finishA' button on the installer, the whole stack
will be integrated, configured and ready to go.

**Relocatable:**  
BitNami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have
multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each
other.

**System Requirements:**

  * Minimum of 256 MB RAM 
  * Minimum of 150 MB hard drive space
