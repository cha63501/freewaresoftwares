**Publisher's Description**  
  

NVPerfKit is a comprehensive suite of performance tools to help debug and
profile OpenGL and Direct3D applications. It gives you access to low-level
performance counters inside the driver and hardware counters inside the GPU
itself. The counters can be used to determine exactly how your application is
using the GPU, identify performance issues, and confirm that performance
problems have been resolved.

The performance counters are available directly in your OpenGL and DirectX
applications and in tools such as IntelA(r) VTuneA and Graphic RemedyAs
gDEBugger via the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Performance Data
Helper (PDH) interface. A plug-in supporting Microsoft PIX for Windows is also
provided, giving you low-latency access to NVPerfKit performance counters
directly from the driver.

NVPerfKit consists of the following components:

  * Instrumented Driver 
    * Interfaces with graphics API and GPU to provide performance counter data 
    * Automatically installed by NVPerfKit installer 
  * NVPerfHUD 
    * Advanced real-time analysis of Direct3D applications 
  * NVPerfSDK 
    * API for accessing GPU signals in your applications 
    * Sample code and helper classes for OpenGL(tm) and DirectX(tm) applications 
    * NVIDIA Developer Control Panel and instrumented driver 
  * NVIDIA Plug-in for Microsoft PIX for Windows 
  * GLExpert 
    * Debug OpenGL usage errors and performance issues 
  * Support for PerfMon, Intel(r) VTune(tm), gDEBugger, and other analysis tools 
  * gDEBugger 30-day trial version
