**Publisher's Description**  
  

As its name indicates, SimpleProgramDebugger is a simple application that you
can use to debug the programs you have installed on your Windows computer. You
can use it to either launch a program in debugging mode or attach it to a
currently running program.

When you want to attach a running program after launching the application, you
simply press F7 and then choose the desired process. If you want to start a
new program, press CTRL+N and then choose the executable file you want.

SimpleProgramDebugger displays a list of all major debugging events that take
place when the program is running. You can then copy the details and paste
then into your spreadsheet program or export them to html, xml, tab-delimited
or comma-delimited files by clicking on ASave Selected items.A

You can translate the program to your desired language by following a few
simple steps and then run it in that language. You can even add such personal
details as your name and website URL, which will appear in the AAboutA Window,
and distribute it so long as you do not make any modifications.

The portable debugging tool is compatible with all Windows operating systems
from Windows XP.

A 64-Bit version is also available: [Download SimpleProgramDebugger
