More freedom, more power, more flexibility! Ghost Installer Free Edition is a small convenient XML based tool for setup creations. Ghost Installer Free Edition does not feature a WYSIWYG Editor. Instead of it it provides a simplified XML editor for experienced programmers.

The most important feature is the InstallerA's ability to use Plug-Ins. This way you can influence the size of your installer engine by choosing the right combination of Plug-Ins. And if you miss one or another function you can create a Plug-In by yourself in either Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Borland C++ Builder or any other programming language or tool that creates Windows DLLs. 

Finally you can offer your own Plug-Ins to other users, so that the Ghost Installer community has access to the newest technologies and brightest ideas!

You can use our forums to discuss Ghost Installer, suggest features and Plug-Ins and report bugs.

WARNING! This tool provides visual interface similar to notepad. To create a setup extensive XML coding is required. For visual and seamless setup creation we recommend to download Ghost Installer Studio Demo Edition.
