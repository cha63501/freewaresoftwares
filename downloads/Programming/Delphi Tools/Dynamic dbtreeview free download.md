**Publisher's Description**  
  

Dynamic DBTreeView controls are based on Virtual TreeView control. They are
using clone dataset for internal data manipulation when dynamically building
tree nodes and a binary search list for detecting existing nodes. They reflect
all changes of the underlining dataset (record insertion, deletion, field
value change) and support drag and drop operation. There are three controls:
TDTADOTree, TDTClientTree, TDTTableTree for TCustomADODataSet,
TCustomClientDataSet and TTable accordingly. If your dataset supports
filtering and you can create its clone dataset, you can derive your own
treeview by overriding CreateCloneDataSet method of the TDTCustomDBTreeView
control.

Freeware. Full source included.
