**Publisher's Description**  
  


Full Glyph adds disabled-state images to glyphs used with button controls in VCL (Visual Component Library, a framework developed by Borland). Those button controls include TBitBtn and TSpeedButton. 

Some glyphs cannot be drawn well on a disabled control. With this application, you can prevent it.
