**Publisher's Description**  
  

Full Glyph adds disabled-state images to glyphs used with button controls in
VCL (Visual Component Library, a framework developed by Borland). Those button
controls include TBitBtn and TSpeedButton.

Some glyphs cannot be drawn well on a disabled control. With this application,
you can prevent it.
