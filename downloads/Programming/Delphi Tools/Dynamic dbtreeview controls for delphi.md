**Publisher's Description**  
  


Dynamic DBTreeView controls are based on Virtual TreeView control. They are using clone dataset for internal data manipulation when dynamically building tree nodes and a binary search list for detecting existing nodes. They reflect all changes of the underlining dataset (record insertion, deletion, field value change) and support drag and drop operation. There are three controls: TDTADOTree, TDTClientTree, TDTTableTree for TCustomADODataSet, TCustomClientDataSet and TTable accordingly. If your dataset supports filtering and you can create its clone dataset, you can derive your own treeview by overriding CreateCloneDataSet method of the TDTCustomDBTreeView control. 

Freeware. Full source included.
