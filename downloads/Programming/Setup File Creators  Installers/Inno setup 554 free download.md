**Publisher's Description**  
  

Inno Setup is a feature-packed installation builder. Features include a wizard
interface, creation of a single EXE for easy online distribution, support for
disk spanning, full uninstall capabilities, customizable setup types,
integrated file compression, support for installing shared files and OCXA's,
and creation of Start Menu icons, INI entries, and registry entries.

**Key Features:**

  * Support for all 32-bit Windows versions in use today -- Windows 95, 98, 2000, 2003, XP, Me, NT 4.0. 
  * Supports creation of a single EXE to install your program for easy online distribution. Disk spanning is also supported. 
  * Standard Windows 2000/XP-style wizard interface. 
  * Customizable setup types, e.g. Full, Minimal, Custom. 
  * Complete uninstall capabilities. 
  * Installation of files: 
  * Includes integrated support for "deflate", bzip2, and 7-Zip LZMA file compression. The installer has the ability to compare file version info, replace in-use files, use shared file counting, register DLL/OCXA's and type libraries, and install fonts. 
  * Creation of shortcuts anywhere, including in the Start Menu and on the desktop. 
  * Creation of registry and .INI entries. 
  * Integrated Pascal scripting engine. 
  * Support for multilingual installs. 
  * Silent install and uninstall. 
  * Full source code is available (Borland Delphi 2.0-5.0). 

**WhatA's New in version 5.5.4:**

  * Added the Windows 8.1 A'compatibilityA' section to the various manifest resources used by Inno Setup. This enables any check for the operating system version to get the real version number (6.3) instead of getting the same version number as it did in Windows 8 (6.2). 
  * Compiler IDE: Added new option: Show line numbers in gutter (default: off). 

**Pascal Scripting changes:**

  * Added new event function CurInstallProgressChanged, which you can use to monitor progress while Setup is extracting files, creating shortcuts, creating INI entries, and creating registry entries. See the help file and the CodeExample1.iss example script for more information. Contributed by TLama via GitHub. 
  * WizardForm.BeveledLabel visibility is now automatically handled even if its caption was set from [Code]. 
  * Unicode [Code] based on RemObjects Pascal Script Git commit 538905910852bcbeef646f26592a973d15d3d5ec. 
  * Minor tweaks.
