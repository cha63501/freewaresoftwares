**Publisher's Description**  
  

FilePacker is a 32-bit Windows application that can be used to temporarily
remove the runtime engines that are used by some programming languages. It
comes with a wizard-orientated design interface that enables you to easily and
quickly create a stand-alone executable of your software for easier
distribution.

FilePacker can accomplish this by placing the runtime engines and other
project files into a self-extracting executable that is extracted to one of
the twenty-one build in extraction directories. This can all take place in
only a few seconds when the stand-alone executable is run.

FilePacker also has the capability to compress the project files by using the
zlib compression library. You can even protect your executable with a password
or you can display a dialog box, with a progress bar, that will display the
percentage of data that has been extracted.

After extracting the project files, FilePacker can launch up to sixty-four
executables simultaneously.

FilePacker can also delete the extracted project files after the running
executables are closed.
