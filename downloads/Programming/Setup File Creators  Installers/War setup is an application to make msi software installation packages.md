**Publisher's Description**  
  


War Setup is an application to make .msi software installation packages. It uses the free Wix toolset from Microsoft to build the .msi files. The target audience for this application is Software Developers. 

War Setup is designed to be very easy to use. ItA's the perfect install tool for the lazy Open Source developer. With bullt in support for Visual Studio C++ integration and the ability to add directories recursively, itA's very easy to add software libraries and generated documentation to the install package.

War Setup is also well suited to handle most install requirements for commecial software. At least for companies who want their install packages to be predictible, robust, easy to make and mantain, inituitive for the end-user, and comformant with the Microsoft Installer guidelines.

IA've emphaized that War SetupA's target audience are lazy developers with better things to do than reading "The definitive guide to Windows Installer" (yea - IA've read it). So you donA't really need to know alot about Windows Installer or Wix in order to use War Setup. If you do - you can utilize your knowledge, but if you donA't - it will still do the job. I got pretty frustrated when I tried to use some of the free installers out there, and they assumed that I knew all about Windows Installer, or Wix, and all their weird properties. So IA've tried to make War Setup 3 really easy to use - even for developers who has their focus on their own products - and not the geeks view of "the Delightful Art of Software Installation".

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
