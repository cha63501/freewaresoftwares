**Publisher's Description**  
  


FilePacker is a 32-bit Windows application that can be used to temporarily remove the runtime engines that are used by some programming languages. It comes with a wizard-orientated design interface that enables you to easily and quickly create a stand-alone executable of your software for easier distribution. 

FilePacker can accomplish this by placing the runtime engines and other project files into a self-extracting executable that is extracted to one of the twenty-one build in extraction directories. This can all take place in only a few seconds when the stand-alone executable is run.

FilePacker also has the capability to compress the project files by using the zlib compression library. You can even protect your executable with a password or you can display a dialog box, with a progress bar, that will display the percentage of data that has been extracted.

After extracting the project files, FilePacker can launch up to sixty-four executables simultaneously.

FilePacker can also delete the extracted project files after the running executables are closed.
