**Publisher's Description**  
  

ISTool helps you create scripts for [Jordan RussellA's Inno
Setup](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Inno-Setup_program_13511.html) compiler.
Inno Setup is a great compiler for very professional looking setups, and the
only disadvantage is that you have to create fairly complex scripts by hand.

This is where ISTool comes in. With this application you can edit these
scripts in a visual environment, and creating these setup scripts becomes much
easier.

**Features:**

  * Support for all Inno Setup directives. 
  * Drag and drop. You can drag files from the Windows Explorer and drop them on the wanted directory in the Files section in ISTool. 
  * Separate script view with syntax coloring. 
  * Clipboard is fully supported in most sections. 
  * Preserves script comments. 
  * Can import Visual Basic .lst files and InstallShield .iwz files. 
  * Translated to multiple languages. 

**Requirements:** [Inno Setup](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Inno-Setup_program_13511.html) to compile the created scripts.
