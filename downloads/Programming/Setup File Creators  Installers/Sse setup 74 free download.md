**Publisher's Description**  
  

SSE Setup is an easy to use install creator (Setup creator). It shines in that
it is Simple, Smart, and Easy. It allows you to create a good looking
installer for your program in literally minutes (NOT hours or days!). You
wonA't find any complicated scripting here!

SSE Setup is easy to use, but its feature list is extensive. It supports all
the standard basics plus lots of frills incl. full Internet Updating support,
built-in multi-language support, full digital signature support, custom
prerequisites with easy download of .NET framework or other prerequisites if
your program needs them and user doesnA't have, and much more. Creates small,
efficient .EXEA's/.ZIPA's or burns to CD/DVD.

Installs you create can support (up to you) most Windows OSA's including
Windows 8, 7, 2008, Vista, XP, 2003, 2000, and 9x/ME/NT4.

**WhatA's new in version 7.4:**

  * Bug Fix: Taskbar progress bar incorrectly shown when progress bar disabled. 
  * Bug Fix: Temporary A'not respondingA' window during some operations. 
  * New Feature (Launchpad): Easy backup and restore of projects and easy ability to share projects with other SSE Setup users.
