**Publisher's Description**  
  

GlassWorks is a free and powerful install builder tool which provides a user
friendly system for deploying applications on multiple platforms. Integration
is supported on Windows, Macintosh OSX and Linux systems.

**Features:**

  * Create links to quickly launch your application. On Macintosh OSX app bundles are created, on other platforms links are created in the menu or desktop. 
  * Associate your application with files by extension or mimetype. 
  * Run your application on startup (Windows and Linux only). 
  * Install files to user selected or predefined locations. 
  * Produce compact pack200 compressed installers. 
  * Display software licenses in either plain text or html format. 
  * Customise messages and logos displayed to users. 
  * Customise the look and feel of the installer. 
  * Restrict actions to specific operating systems. 

Links and file type associations allow you specify an icon to be displayed,
this icon must be provided in the appropriate format for the platform, ico
files for Windows, icns files for Macintosh OSX and png for Linux/Unix
systems.

Tools for creating icns files are very scarce on platforms other than
Macintosh OSX so GlassWorks includes a tool for creating these files,
IcnWriter.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It
