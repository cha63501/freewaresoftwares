**Publisher's Description**  
  


The intention of this tool is that an MSI or merge module (any Windows database) can be manipulated or created with a very few number of lines and without writing code. Any "common" manipulations are setup once and reused for all your MSI files. 

All files are in text format so are easy to read and compare, you could easily create an MSI with a "handful" of commands (such as 2 line MSIs...). An HTML report is created when creating an MSI (this includes a file "verify" button). Also has a MSI dump and difference tool which you will find easy to read (and MAKEMSI can also process).

**WhatA's New in version 13.321:**

  * Implemented a fix suggested by Jason Gibbons to handle redefining A'TABLES_FILE_SEQ_NUMBER_LIMITA' from its default value 2 to 4 (in order to handles > 32767 files). 
  * Assorted improvements to the A'Regular Expression TesterA' tool.
