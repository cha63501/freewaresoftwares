**Publisher's Description**  
  


In the past adding some customization to Jordan RussellA's Inno Setup one had to look for pieces of code and implement them into their own script. Now this new generation of ISSI makes it possible to add with just a few lines of code prefab functionality to Inno Setup. 

These includes use the basic include functionality to quickly add and remove various customization. This is a great advantage to manually incorporating the desired customization into each script.

This is not only useful for new users of Inno Setup, also experienced users might find it useful to be able to quickly implement some functionality in various scripts without much of a hassle. Some might even be inspired to create their own library of frequently used functions.

Requirements: Inno Setup 4.2.2 (or higher) with Inno Setup PreProcessor
