**Publisher's Description**  
  

War Setup is an application to make .msi software installation packages. It
uses the free Wix toolset from Microsoft to build the .msi files. The target
audience for this application is Software Developers.

War Setup is designed to be very easy to use. ItA's the perfect install tool
for the lazy Open Source developer. With bullt in support for Visual Studio
C++ integration and the ability to add directories recursively, itA's very
easy to add software libraries and generated documentation to the install
package.

War Setup is also well suited to handle most install requirements for
commecial software. At least for companies who want their install packages to
be predictible, robust, easy to make and mantain, inituitive for the end-user,
and comformant with the Microsoft Installer guidelines.

IA've emphaized that War SetupA's target audience are lazy developers with
better things to do than reading "The definitive guide to Windows Installer"
(yea - IA've read it). So you donA't really need to know alot about Windows
Installer or Wix in order to use War Setup. If you do - you can utilize your
knowledge, but if you donA't - it will still do the job. I got pretty
frustrated when I tried to use some of the free installers out there, and they
assumed that I knew all about Windows Installer, or Wix, and all their weird
properties. So IA've tried to make War Setup 3 really easy to use - even for
developers who has their focus on their own products - and not the geeks view
of "the Delightful Art of Software Installation".

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
