**Publisher's Description**  
  

Increases the capabilities of Autorun. Autorun has limitations to only execute
applications. Daboo AutoRun removes these limitations by allowing executables
or associated files to be executed.

For example: You can configure DAR to automatically open an html document with
the computerA's default web browser when a cd is inserted. Autorun cannot do
this, but, Daboo AutoRun CAN.

Tested file types include: pdf, jpg, html, doc, xls, and exe. This is not the
limit, any file type associated with an application in windows will work.
