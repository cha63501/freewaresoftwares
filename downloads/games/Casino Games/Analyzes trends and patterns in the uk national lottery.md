**Publisher's Description**  
  


Babbitt is a lottery result analyzer, for the UK National Lottery. 

Babbitt has a number of features, including:

  * Filter search data to analyse draw data on specific dates and/or specific machines and/or sets of balls 
  * Analyse trends in A'dormantA' and A'activeA' periods a ball or combination has passed through 
  * Unique graphical charts that use ascending colours to highlight the most common patterns 
  * Rate combinations using paired-ball frequencies 
  * Search for the best rated combinations 
  * Choose between four rating schemes, each subtly different to match your views on how past draw data should be interpreted 

Babbitt is not a random number generator. The software uses mathematical equations to rate lottery numbers. The method is based on paired-ball-frequencies. The derivations of these equations are included in the download so you can read and evaluate the scheme for yourself. 

Babbitt takes less than 20 seconds to download and runs in a series of web-pages, so there is no installation procedure - just open the page. 

A [15-minute on-line tutorial](http://www.lucidviews.net/software/babbitt/tutorial) is available to show you how to use the program to it?s full potential.

Note: Requires Internet Explorer 4.x and above or Netscape 4.x and above.
