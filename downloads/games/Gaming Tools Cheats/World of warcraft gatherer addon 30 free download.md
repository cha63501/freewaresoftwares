**Publisher's Description**  
  

World of Warcraft Gatherer is an addon which tracks items you gather in the
course of your adventures and records their locations on your minimap so that
you can keep track of their locations as you are adventuring around Azeroth or
the Outlands.

The two professions that benefit more from this tracking are herbalism and
mining, because it allows you to create a database of available resources as
you level up. The add-on also records the value of each individual herb or
mine.

In addition to Gatherer, GathererDB are prebuilt databases that are made
available for import into Gatherer. You simply install the version of Gatherer
from above, and a database from below. When you look in the Gatherer
configuration screen, you will be able to import the database via the Database
section, and enjoy going and finding the new nodes.
