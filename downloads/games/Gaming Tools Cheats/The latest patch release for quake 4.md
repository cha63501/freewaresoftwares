**Game Background**  
Earth is under siege by the Strogg, a barbaric alien race moving through the universe consuming, recycling and annihilating any civilization in their path. In a desperate attempt to survive, an armada of EarthAs finest warriors is sent to take the battle to the Strogg home planet.

You are Matthew Kane, an elite member of Rhino Squad and EarthA's valiant invasion force. Fight alone, with your squad, or in hover tanks and mechanized walkers as you engage in a heroic mission to the heart of the Strogg war machine. Battle through the beginning of the game as a combat marine, then after your capture, as a marine-turned-Strogg with enhanced abilities and the power to turn the tide of the war.
