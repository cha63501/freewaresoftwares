**Publisher's Description**  
  


Graphic Track Maker is a slot car race track layout generator that can be used to find new layouts for slot car race sets or other similar sets. It can either randomly generate or perform an exhaustive search for track layouts. The layouts are displayed graphically and also by description to aid in visualizing and setting up the race track design. 

Graphic Track Maker gives you the ability to enter many different sections of slot car track, train track, etc. by name, number of sections, angle, and either the radius or length of the outer edge. Once entered, you can use the program to randomly search for new track designs. This is particularly useful if you have lost a section of track or combined two or more track sets since the instructions that came with your slot car set will only show layouts using all of the original pieces. 

Additionally, since it is random, the results can be quite interesting with possibly hairpin turns and long straight sections for speed. The program can also search sequentially through all mathematical configurations in an effort to find every possible track pattern. For smaller sets this can be informative, but be warned this number becomes ridiculously large very quickly for sets of more than about 15 sections.
