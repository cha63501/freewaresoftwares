**Publisher's Description**  
  

iDeaS is a Nintendo DS emulator that can run NDS games on Windows PC with
OpenGL. So far, it has emulated the ARM7 GBA processor at 100%, but the ARM9
dual screen processor at 90%. The touch screen is fully emulated with a cursor
instead of hand. It works with a keyboard.

The emulator is unable to play NDS games because the touchscreen is unstable
at the moment according to the release notes. The plugin system came
originally from UltraHLE N64 emulator so that further support can achieved
without looking at the source code of the emulator. There are no plugins.

**What's New in version 1.0.3.3:**

  * Fixed some bugs in timers emulation. 
  * Fixed a bug in alpha blending between OAM and layers. 
  * Fixed a bug closing the compressed files. 
  * Added some speedup at the emulation. 
  * Added new formats for the screenshots and fixed bug during the capture.
