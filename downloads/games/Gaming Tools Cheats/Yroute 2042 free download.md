**Publisher's Description**  
  

If youA've decompiled the AI traffic from Flight Sim 2002 (or later) with Lee
SwordyA's TrafficTools utilities youA'll know that editing the resulting
flight plans and aircraft by hand can be time consuming and prone to errors.

ThereA's something about editing a 2.5 meg text file in Wordpad which just
doesnA't appeal to me, so I set out to write something which would allow me to
do what I wanted - namely, to populate deserted airfields with a variety of
interesting aircraft.
