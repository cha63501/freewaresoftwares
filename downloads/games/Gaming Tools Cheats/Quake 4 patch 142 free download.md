**Game Background**  
Earth is under siege by the Strogg, a barbaric alien race moving through the
universe consuming, recycling and annihilating any civilization in their path.
In a desperate attempt to survive, an armada of EarthAs finest warriors is
sent to take the battle to the Strogg home planet.

You are Matthew Kane, an elite member of Rhino Squad and EarthA's valiant
invasion force. Fight alone, with your squad, or in hover tanks and mechanized
walkers as you engage in a heroic mission to the heart of the Strogg war
machine. Battle through the beginning of the game as a combat marine, then
after your capture, as a marine-turned-Strogg with enhanced abilities and the
power to turn the tide of the war.
