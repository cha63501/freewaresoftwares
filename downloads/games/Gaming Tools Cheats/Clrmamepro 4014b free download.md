**Publisher's Description**  
  

ClrMamePro is a so-called ROM-manager. If you use M.A.M.E. you know the
problem. With every new release a lot has been changed. New gamesets have been
added, some have been removed, etc. ClrMamePro helps you to keep your ROM
collection up-to-date.

Here is a small list of what ClrMamePro can do:

  * finding missing games, roms, samples 
  * find and rename wrong named roms, samples 
  * find and resize wrong sized roms 
  * find wrong checksums (bad dumps, etc.) 
  * find and remove unneeded files 
  * merge and unmerge roms 
  * rebuilding gamesets 
  * add new sets 

**WhatA's New in version 4.014b:**

  * fixed: not initialized variable causes 7z decompress warnings in Windows 8.1 (64bit only)
