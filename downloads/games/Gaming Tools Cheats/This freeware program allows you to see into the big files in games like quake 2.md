**Publisher's Description**  
  


This freeware program allows you to see into the big files in games like Quake 2 (go look in the BaseQ2 sub directory, see the big PAK0.PAK file, thatA's one) and extract files to anywhere you want easily. 

This version is faster than any previous version, uses external drivers (DLL files) to read file formats and does not need those huge (2mb) DLL to run (like in version 4).
