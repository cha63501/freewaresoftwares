**Publisher's Description**  
  


pSX emulates the Sony Playstation 1, almost everything is emulated (to my knowledge) and most if not all games should run perfectly. One thing that should be noted is that pSX DOES NOT use plugins. The emulator is completely self contained. 

The emulator has been designed to be as easy and unobtrusive to use as possible - in most cases you will not need to configure anything to use it (except maybe the controls).

If you get an error message saying d3dx9_26.dll is missing, download the required package: [d3dx9_26.dll](http://www.freewarefiles.com/files/D3DXDLLJune26.zip).

Note: you will need a PS1 BIOS image - it should be called SCPH1001.bin and placed in the bios folder of the emulator. [Download SCPH1001.bin](http://www.freewarefiles.com/files/scph1001.rar).
