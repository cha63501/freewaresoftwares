**Publisher's Description**  
  


Muvixer is a utility that allows you to specify the recording input to always have set. Some games will change the recording input to Microphone on loading. For users that use Line 2 or other recording lines, this means that after the game has loaded, you have to alt-tab out, change the recording input back to the correct line and then go back into your game. Some games goes as far to change the input on every map change. It runs in the background and watches for these changes and automatically changes it to the correct recording device. 

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
