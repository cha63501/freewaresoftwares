**Publisher's Description**  
  


AdriPSX is a Sony PlayStation emulator, developed by Roor Makurosu. 

It can run several games (CD or downloaded roms) designed for the PSX console on a PC running Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP or DOS. Its perfomance depends heavily on your PC configuration, and what kind of PSX game you are trying to run. AdriPSX will never substitute a true PSX but it can give you the excitement to run your favorite games on your PC. Many games will not work properly or not work at all. 

The author is very aware of this and IA'm always trying my best to make more games work flawlessly and speed up its performance.
