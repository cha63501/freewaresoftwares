**Publisher's Description**  
  

Game Launcher is the perfect solution for organizing all of your PC games in
one centralized location. Instead of having icons spread across your desktop
or buried in your Start menu, you can access all of them in one easy to manage
program.

Game Launcher allows you to use life-size cover art images of your games to
identify each one. The software will also use mini-covers to display your 8
most recently played games. This allows for even quicker access to the games
you play on a regular basis. Simply double click the mini-cover to launch the
game.

In addition to showing off your game boxes, for each game you can also add
your own customizable audio clips to be played when you select or launch that
game. For example, you could play a clip of the Star WarsA theme when you
select your BattleFront II game and then hear the sweet sound of blaster fire
when you launch the game. Though is feature is optional, many obsessive gamers
may find it quite satisfying.

Game Launcher also features an option which allows you to designate whether a
game is currently installed or not. This way if you uninstall a game from your
computer you can simply uncheck this box and it will no longer appear in your
current games list, but Game Launcher will retain all game data so that you
can simply recheck the box without re-entering all the necessary details
should you choose to reinstall the game. Best of all, Game Launcher is free.

**Features:**

  * Use life-size cover images of your games to show off the cover art and make your games easily identifiable 
  * Game Launcher automatically adds up to 8 "favorites" using mini cover images for even easier access to the games you use most often 
  * Game list can be toggled between showing all games and only games that are currently installed 
  * Use audio clips from your games (or any other source) to be played when the game is selected or launched 
  * Eliminate the clutter of icons on the desktop and searching for games buried in the Start menu by keeping all of your games in one easy to manage list
