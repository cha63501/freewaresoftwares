**Publisher's Description**  
  

Wintermute Engine Development Kit is a set of tools for creating and running
graphical Apoint&clickA adventure games, both traditional 2D ones and modern
2.5D games (3D characters on 2D backgrounds). The kit includes the runtime
interpreter (Wintermute Engine, or WME) and GUI editors for managing and
creating the game content (WME tools) as well as the documentation,
demonstrational data and prefabricated templates.
