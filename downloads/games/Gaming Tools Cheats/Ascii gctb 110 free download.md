**Publisher's Description**  
  

ASCII GCTB is aimed at creating game cheat NFO files; however, is suited to
creating any text file (NFO, DIZ, or TXT) with ease. The program uses multiple
inputs, edit boxes, templates, project files, and a coding syntax to allow
creating any design needed.  
  
To help make cheat releases faster a button labeled File Data will set many of
the input text fields for you automatically, including the MD5 hash. Select
the game file (EXE or any format) and it will gather all available data.  
  
Also included is a archive package tool that creates 7z, TAR, or ZIP
compressed files. Simply browse and add files to the list, select your
settings, and create the archive. Settings include a ZIP comment (with coding
syntax), password, compression level, and more. Archives are created using the
open source 7-Zip program.  
  
The program comes with a extensive help file, view it inside the program Help
tab, and several example project and template files. When the program is first
started it will load the Example1 project to help get you started.  
  
The included examples show the different alignment, width, input types, and
coding that are available. The Example4 project creates a text resume to show
how easy it is to create any text file. The Example6 template demonstrates
design freedom. The others show creating a cheat release NFO with the numerous
program options.  
  
ASCII GCTB is released as GNU GPL free software, and the source files are
included with all downloads.
