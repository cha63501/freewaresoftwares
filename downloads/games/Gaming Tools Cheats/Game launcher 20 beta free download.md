**Publisher's Description**  
  

GameLauncher is a Game ROM Managment Tool designed to make emulating games
easier than playing them on a console! To play a ROM just select it in the
game list and click Launch, within a few seconds the default engine for that
ROM will appear and the ROM will play. Game Launcher is also pretty simple and
easy-to-use, helping you even more by guiding you with a program wizard.
