**Publisher's Description**  
  


ET: Quake Wars Tweaker allows you to increase the performance of the game without losing too much of the graphical quality. Before making any changes, it creates a back-up of your current configuration. ET: Quake Wars Tweaker will also allow you to modify your tweaked settings again if youA're not satisfied. You can choose which settings you want to enable, although some are required. 

Remember: Quake Wars Tweaker only tweaks settings that arenA't found in-game, so you can always disable some items yourself to further increase performance. Disabling shadows for example, is highly recommended.

**New in version 1.1:**

  * added 6 new tweaks and altered tweak descriptions 
  * added support for beta 2 
  * minor fixes 

Requires: [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_10_108_16026.html).
