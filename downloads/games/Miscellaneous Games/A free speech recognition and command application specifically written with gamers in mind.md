**Publisher's Description**  
  


PiLfIuS! is a FREE speech recognition and command application specifically written with gamers in mind. It will identify whatever commands you speak into your microphone, and send keystrokes accordingly. Commands, and their respective keystrokes are fully configurable by the user. 

Unlike many other speech recognition applications, keystrokes sent by PiLfIuS! should be recognized by ANY application, since these programs will not tell the difference between a keystroke sent by your keyboard, and a keystroke sent as a result of your voice commands.

PiLfIuS! requires a SAPI-compatible Speech Recognition Engine to be installed in your computer. You may download one for free from Microsoft. [Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=10121).
