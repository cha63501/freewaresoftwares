**Publisher's Description**  
  

Cactus Strowberry and his friends Sminkio and Bistian go to visit the Dance
City museum, to see an ancient column. Bistian breaks the column and releases
a demon called Pantaleon DuChaCha. The demon takes Bistian and Sminkio as his
servants and begins his plan to make the entire world a disco. In order to
stop Pantaleon, Cactus needs to find all the column shards.

The game was developed with rpgmaker VX, and has the classic style of the tap-
dance music game. Cactus is free to visit the Dance City map and choose the
levels; if the player wins all the challenges he unlocks the final stage.
Before the challenge, the player can choose between four different
difficulties.
