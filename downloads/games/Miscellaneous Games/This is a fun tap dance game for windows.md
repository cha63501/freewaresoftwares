**Publisher's Description**  
  


Cactus Strowberry and his friends Sminkio and Bistian go to visit the Dance City museum, to see an ancient column. Bistian breaks the column and releases a demon called Pantaleon DuChaCha. The demon takes Bistian and Sminkio as his servants and begins his plan to make the entire world a disco. In order to stop Pantaleon, Cactus needs to find all the column shards. 

The game was developed with rpgmaker VX, and has the classic style of the tap-dance music game. Cactus is free to visit the Dance City map and choose the levels; if the player wins all the challenges he unlocks the final stage. Before the challenge, the player can choose between four different difficulties.
