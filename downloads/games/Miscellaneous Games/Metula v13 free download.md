**Publisher's Description**  
  

This is a one or two player board game, in 3D. The object of the game is to
block the enemy playerA's pawn.

On each turn, the player moves its pawn to a neighbor square, and then places
a block on any square on the board. If you play against the computer, you can
choose between several difficulty levels. You can also ask the computer for a
"hint" for your next move.
