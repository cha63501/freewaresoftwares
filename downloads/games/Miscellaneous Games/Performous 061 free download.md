**Publisher's Description**  
  

Performous is an open-source rhythm/performance platform that contains
singing, guitar/bass playing, drumming and dancing all in one game.

While Performous might be classified as a karaoke program, it is actually much
more than that. Instead of just displaying the lyrics, notes are also
displayed and the performance is scored based on how well you actually hit the
notes.

Unlike in most other games in this genre, you will also see the precise pitch
that you are singing, so that you can see what you are doing wrong and easily
(well, everything is relative) correct your pitch.

Most of the songs available also contain the original vocals and actual
karaoke versions are rare.

For those who sing rather than well, a karaoke mode is provided. In this mode
only lyrics are displayed and there are no notes or scoring.

Since 0.5.0 you can use dance pad to play dance songs in StepMania format.
Again, the performance is scored based on how accurately the scrolling notes
are hit. Let the rhythm guide your feet!
