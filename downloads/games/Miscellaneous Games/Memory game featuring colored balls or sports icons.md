Memory Balls is a little game that challenges your memory. Easy mode is 2 colored balls (or optional sports icons: bowling ball, basketball, baseball, etc.), and the difficulty level can be upped to 7 colors (or sports icons). A player is given 10 seconds to study the board, and several minutes to match what was displayed. 

To play, left click on each square until the icon is set to the correct color (or sports ball). Game rounds will continue on until you fail to match the board. Sounds easy enough, right? Well then, put your memory to the test.

**Features:**

  * 6 Difficulty Settings 
  * Optional Sports Icons 
  * Sound Effects 
  * Touchscreen compatible
