**Publisher's Description**  
  

PiLfIuS! is a FREE speech recognition and command application specifically
written with gamers in mind. It will identify whatever commands you speak into
your microphone, and send keystrokes accordingly. Commands, and their
respective keystrokes are fully configurable by the user.

Unlike many other speech recognition applications, keystrokes sent by PiLfIuS!
should be recognized by ANY application, since these programs will not tell
the difference between a keystroke sent by your keyboard, and a keystroke sent
as a result of your voice commands.

PiLfIuS! requires a SAPI-compatible Speech Recognition Engine to be installed
in your computer. You may download one for free from Microsoft. [Microsoft
Speech SDK 5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=10121).
