**Publisher's Description**  
  

zSILENCER is an addicting multiplayer platformer played online with other
people where the goal is to collect files. Jetpack around, shoot blasters and
rockets, and detonate remote plasma bombs. Kill other players and make them
drop their files so you can pick them up and use them to buy more weapons and
killing devices.

The team who manages to get three top secret files to their base wins the
game. Each team must choose a place on the map to spawn their base "door".
Teammates enter and can heal their shields and health, buy inventory items,
and return files. Infiltrate the base of other teams and plant some
detonators, wait for them to try returning their files they collected and
detonate!

There are five different agencies that you can play as, each with special
stats or unique items, and online supports up to 24 players in a match. Play a
2v2, 3v3, or 3v2v4v1, anything is possible. You are sure to get an adrenaline
rush when playing this fast paced platformer with others.
