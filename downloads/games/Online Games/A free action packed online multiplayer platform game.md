**Publisher's Description**  
  


zSILENCER is an addicting multiplayer platformer played online with other people where the goal is to collect files. Jetpack around, shoot blasters and rockets, and detonate remote plasma bombs. Kill other players and make them drop their files so you can pick them up and use them to buy more weapons and killing devices. 

The team who manages to get three top secret files to their base wins the game. Each team must choose a place on the map to spawn their base "door". Teammates enter and can heal their shields and health, buy inventory items, and return files. Infiltrate the base of other teams and plant some detonators, wait for them to try returning their files they collected and detonate!

There are five different agencies that you can play as, each with special stats or unique items, and online supports up to 24 players in a match. Play a 2v2, 3v3, or 3v2v4v1, anything is possible. You are sure to get an adrenaline rush when playing this fast paced platformer with others.
