**Publisher's Description**  
  


Warzone 2100 is a 3D real-time strategy game, developed by Pumpkin Studios (Archived website) and published by Eidos-Interactive. In late 2004 Warzone was released by its copyright holders, Eidos-Interactive, to the public under the GNU General Public License and the Warzone 2100 Resurrection Project was born. 

The game offers campaign, multi-player, and single-player skirmish modes. An extensive tech tree with over 400 different technologies, combined with the unit design system, allows for a wide variety of possible units and tactics. 

Although comparable to Earth2150 in many significant aspects, it does contain some features that are unique. These include various radar technologies, a greater focus on artillery and counter-battery technologies, more frequent in-game cinematic updates as gameplay progress, as well as a different vehicle design method.

**System Requirements:**

  * ~1 GHz CPU 
  * 64 MB graphics card with good OpenGL support (make sure you have the newest drivers installed) 
  * ~100 MB free RAM for the game 
  * ~100 MB HD space for the game, up to ~ 600 MB extra for the large videos
