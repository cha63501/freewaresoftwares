BakerA's Game is renowned as the most difficult Freecell Solitaire variation known to man. It plays similarly to the card game Freecell, but in Bakers Game you must build stacks by suit, NOT by alternating color. 

As in Freecell, beat BakerA's Game by getting all 52 cards into the four foundations in the top-right corner. You can place cards from the tableau into the four free cells in the top-left corner--but, always make sure you have a plan.
