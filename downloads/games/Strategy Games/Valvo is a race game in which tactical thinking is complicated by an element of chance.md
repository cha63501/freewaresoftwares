**Publisher's Description**  
  


Valvo is a strategy game for two players. It combines simple rules with remarkably subtle tactical possibilities. Valvo is a race game in which tactical thinking is complicated by an element of chance, much as in Backgammon. But Valvo is so much easier than Backgammon, both to learn and play, that you will master the rules quickly. You can play Valvo against a fellow human, or against the computer, which has 6 difficulty levels that range from easy to very challenging.
