**Publisher's Description**  
  

Discordi challenges you to guess how others will answer funny and thought-
provoking questions. Correct predictions can allow you to climb the Ziggurat,
a pyramid that changes layout with every game. There are good steps (read: IQ
Points) and bad steps, and random storms can affect your ascent. IQ Points
increase at the top, especially during the Blowout round when you can blast
above the pyramid to collect high numbers.

Your player will be visible on the Ziggurat and do all the climbing for you,
and youA'll be playing against many opponent plaers, up to 100 others, each
representing another person online. All you have to do is answer questions.
Since the players change from game to game, the answers change, creating a new
experience everytime.

Getting to the top of the Ziggurat can be difficult, but it is the IQ points
that really matter. The player(s) with the most IQ Points in game wins, and
those points are cumulative. You can see at the end of each game your total
points and average points per game.

Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/dow
nloads/updates/default.aspx). (Note that .NET Framework is included in Windows
XP. It is recommended to update to the latest version.)
