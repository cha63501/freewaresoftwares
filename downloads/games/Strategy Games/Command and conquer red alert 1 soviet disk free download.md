**Publisher's Description**  
  

Command and Conquer: Red Alert is a popular strategy game created by EA. For
the thirteenth anniversary of Command & Conquer, EA officially released Red
Alert for free download. The story takes place in an alternate stream of
history, around the time of World War II.

In this version of world history, World War II never happened, and Hitler was
nothing more than a minor annoyance. The real threat here is something
hundreds of times worse than Hitler could ever have been: Joseph Stalin. The
Soviet Empire is killing its way through Europe. Towns are falling and
countries collapsing before the overwhelming might of the Soviet forces. Does
anyone stand a chance, or will the Red Menace engulf all of Europe?

New features include improved AI, new game units and structures, a Skirmish
mode, and a detailed, interweaving story line.
