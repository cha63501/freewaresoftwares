**Publisher's Description**  
  


Venables is an abstract two-player strategy game with a special twist: instead of moving your pieces yourself, you control them indirectly by means of a cursor on an auxiliary board where the squares have icons specifying the moves you will make on the main board. Other unusual features of Venables are that you can make more than one move on the same turn, and capture more than one piece in a single move. Despite its novel features, Venables is easy to learn, and the computer itself provides a patient opponent while youA're getting used to the game.
