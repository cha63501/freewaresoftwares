**Publisher's Description**  
  


Sacculus: The Wargame is a turn-based strategy game. It is made of a campaign driven by a story told by picture, text, voice and dialogues. In each level, you get objectives and when you accomplish them, a new part of the story and a new level become unlocked. 

At the beginning of each level, you gain control of a group of units - warriors, knights and wizards - and you see a map but its majority is covered by a fog of war. During your turns, you then need to move your units and make them explore the surroundings and attack enemy units.

Also in the game are "Ancient Stars," that you can pick up. However, that is more difficult than only winning the level. For each star that you pick up, a bonus feature becomes available. Those features include bonus levels or cheat codes.
