**Publisher's Description**  
  


Command and Conquer: Red Alert is a popular strategy game created by EA. For the thirteenth anniversary of Command & Conquer, EA officially released Red Alert for free download. The story takes place in an alternate stream of history, around the time of World War II. 

In this version of world history, World War II never happened, and Hitler was nothing more than a minor annoyance. The real threat here is something hundreds of times worse than Hitler could ever have been: Joseph Stalin. The Soviet Empire is killing its way through Europe. Towns are falling and countries collapsing before the overwhelming might of the Soviet forces. Does anyone stand a chance, or will the Red Menace engulf all of Europe? 

New features include improved AI, new game units and structures, a Skirmish mode, and a detailed, interweaving story line.
