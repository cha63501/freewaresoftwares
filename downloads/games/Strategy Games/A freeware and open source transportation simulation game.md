**Publisher's Description**  
  


Simutrans is a freeware and open-source transportation simulation game. 

Your goal is to establish a successful transport company. Transport passengers, mail and goods by rail, road, ship, and even air. Interconnect districts, cities, public buildings, industries and tourist attractions by buiding a transport network you always dreamed of.

Planes, ships, trains, trams, trucks, busses and monorails are at your disposal. You can control and watch your finances and the traffic of your vehicles and goods.

You can play as long as you like. Start in 1880 and finish in 2050. There will be new vehicles and buildings throughout this time. Cities will grow and merge forming metropolises.

Play against the AI or on your own. Only if you are in debt for three months, you are bankrupt and the game is over. 

Additional Scenery Paksets are also [available for download](http://www.simutrans.com/paksets.htm).
