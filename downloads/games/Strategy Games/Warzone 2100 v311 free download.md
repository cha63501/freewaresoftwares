**Publisher's Description**  
  

Warzone 2100 is a 3D real-time strategy game, developed by Pumpkin Studios
(Archived website) and published by Eidos-Interactive. In late 2004 Warzone
was released by its copyright holders, Eidos-Interactive, to the public under
the GNU General Public License and the Warzone 2100 Resurrection Project was
born.

The game offers campaign, multi-player, and single-player skirmish modes. An
extensive tech tree with over 400 different technologies, combined with the
unit design system, allows for a wide variety of possible units and tactics.

Although comparable to Earth2150 in many significant aspects, it does contain
some features that are unique. These include various radar technologies, a
greater focus on artillery and counter-battery technologies, more frequent in-
game cinematic updates as gameplay progress, as well as a different vehicle
design method.

**System Requirements:**

  * ~1 GHz CPU 
  * 64 MB graphics card with good OpenGL support (make sure you have the newest drivers installed) 
  * ~100 MB free RAM for the game 
  * ~100 MB HD space for the game, up to ~ 600 MB extra for the large videos
