**Publisher's Description**  
  

Cave Dudes is all about primitive warfare. You are a caveman on one side of a
hill, and you pick up and throw rocks at your enemy on the other side of the
hill.

Cave Dudes is four games in one. It has a strategy mode and an arcade mode for
one or two players. In the strategy mode you choose the power and angle for
your throws as you chuck rocks over the hill. In the arcade mode you just pick
up and hurl rocks as fast as you can before you get nailed by the other guy.
Rocks bad. Cavedudes good.
