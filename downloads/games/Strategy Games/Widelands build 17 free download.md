**Publisher's Description**  
  

Widelands is an open source (GPLed) real-time strategy game. It is built upon
the SDL and other open source libraries and is (and will always be) under
heavy development.

If you knew Settlers I & IIA (A(c) Bluebyte), then you already have a rough
idea what Widelands is all about because Widelands is heavily inspired by
those two games.

**Features:**

  * Four Worlds (Tile Sets) (Greenland, Winterland, Blackland and Desert) 
  * Three Tribes (Barbarians, Imperials and Atlanteans) 
  * Several playable single player (tutorial) missions 
  * Maps for single and multiplayer mode 
  * Save and load of single and multiplayer games 
  * Ability to build a settlement from scratch 
  * Military and warfare (Attacking, Training, defending, conquering of military buildings) 
  * A map editor, to build your own maps and campaigns
