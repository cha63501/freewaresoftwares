**Publisher's Description**  
  

TA Spring is an open source project aiming to create a new RTS (realtime
strategy) game. By default there is XTA mod known from Total Annihilation to
get something to play with. Plus You can play additional mods like Absolute
Annihilation, UberHack, etc. It reads original TA unit formats directly
without conversions needed, so 3rd party units work just as well as the
original ones. Maps from original TA are not supported.
