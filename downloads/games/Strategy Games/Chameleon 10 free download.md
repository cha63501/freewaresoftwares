**Publisher's Description**  
  

Chameleon is a strategy game inspired by the boardgame Reversi. Like Reversi,
you are trying to have more orbs of your color on the board than any of the
other colors. The difference with this game is that you can play with up to
four players, and there are computer controlled AI players. Also, there are
several different board layouts, not just the plain square setup.
