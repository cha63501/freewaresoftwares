**Publisher's Description**  
  

This game is very similar to backgammon. In this game you need to move all
your pieces around the board once and then move them out of the board. Each
player has 15 pieces and they are positioned at the top right position at the
start of the game. The pieces must move in the counter clockwise direction
until all of them reach the final 6 positions at the bottom right, and then
you can begin to move them out of the board. The player who first moves all
his pieces out wins the game.

**Requires:** [Adobe AIR](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Adobe-AIR_program_42448.html).
