**Publisher's Description**  
  

Simutrans is a freeware and open-source transportation simulation game.

Your goal is to establish a successful transport company. Transport
passengers, mail and goods by rail, road, ship, and even air. Interconnect
districts, cities, public buildings, industries and tourist attractions by
buiding a transport network you always dreamed of.

Planes, ships, trains, trams, trucks, busses and monorails are at your
disposal. You can control and watch your finances and the traffic of your
vehicles and goods.

You can play as long as you like. Start in 1880 and finish in 2050. There will
be new vehicles and buildings throughout this time. Cities will grow and merge
forming metropolises.

Play against the AI or on your own. Only if you are in debt for three months,
you are bankrupt and the game is over.

Additional Scenery Paksets are also [available for
download](http://www.simutrans.com/paksets.htm).

**Note: You may need [unicows.dll](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=4237) for Windows 95/98.**
