**Publisher's Description**  
  


The object of this game is to guess the sequence of a number of colored pegs the computer has selected at random. You can select with how many different colors and how many columns you want to play (3 - 7 each). With the number of colors and/or columns you can raise the severity code. 

You start filling the holes at the bottom row with pegs, and each time you have completed a guess (i.e. filled all holes) the computer will respond by giving you one peg for each correct color - black if your guess was also in the right place, otherwise white - but you will not be informed about which colors and which place were correct. That part you will have to figure out for yourself. 

If you havenA't managed to guess the sequence in the 18th row, the game ends and you can try a new one.
