Super Pac Munch is a simple Pac Man derivative. With each new wave you must avoid all of the ghosts (and sometimes there are a lot), and eat all of the white dots to advance. There really is no grid or maze; rather, you play in an open space. If you run out of time, you are penalized. For extra points you can eat food and treasure bonuses. 

Features music, sound effects, cute graphics, and high score tracking. Created with Game Maker. Freeware.
