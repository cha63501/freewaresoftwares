**Publisher's Description**  
  

A traditional game like pacman. The goal of this game is to get all the sweet
wort (dots) by eating them with your yeast cells (pacman). Bad bacteria try to
eat you so you should avoid them. The kegs of beer will help you. When you eat
a keg the bacteria temporarily become afraid and can be chased for points.
Also sometimes a bonus beer bottle appears. Get the highest score and donA't
be eaten. If the bacteria take over the yeast cells, the beer is ruined!
