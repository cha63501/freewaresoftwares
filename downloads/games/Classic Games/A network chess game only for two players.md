**Publisher's Description**  
  


King Wars is a network chess game only for two players. This game can be played through internet, but I recommend through some VPN (Virtual Private Network) for example Hamachi. In game are programmed all official chess rules, various settings for displaying chessboard and communication between players is encrypted.
