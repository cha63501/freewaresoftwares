**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tic Tac Toe (also called noughts and crosses) is a fun and simple pencil-and-
paper game for two players.

In this version, you play only against another Human player.

This is my first C# application, I hope you enjoy the game.

In the next version, I will try to implement new features, as the possibility
of play against the computer.

If you have any questions or requests concerning the Tic Tac Toe program,
contact me at my E-Mail address or my Web site.
