Explore the galaxy! Jump from planet to planet! Pick all the balls... and escape from evils ghosts! 

Ballman Planets is an addictive and extremely fun tribute to the classic Pacman game!

Of course, there are balls, power ups and ghosts... each of them with different characteristics and behavior (check out the lovely blind green-ghost!), but also there are many different planets and cool springs that allow you to jump from one planet to another!

With its innovative fully mouse-controlled action and stunning 3D maps (also available in 3D anaglyph mode if you have glasses!) Ballman Planets won the RetroAccion 2010 contest (a Pacman-style based game competition).
