**Publisher's Description**  
  


Asstroidz is an Asteroids clone. 

**Features:**

  * Streaming music. The game connects to psyradio so you get an upbeat soundtrack to game to. The benefit of streaming the music is that it makes the initial download much smaller than if you had to download the soundtrack along with the game. 
  * Multiple ships. The game comes with a choice between 3 different ships. Each have their own handling and armor characteristics which allows the player to pick different strategies. 
  * Power ups. Health regeneration, Invincibility, and Double Shot power ups make the game much more interesting. It also allows skilled players to progress very far into the game. 
  * Accuracy counter. This counts your accuracy. I have not seen this in an asteroids game before. I will be building some bonuses off of this in future versions possibly. 
  * 3D graphics card required
