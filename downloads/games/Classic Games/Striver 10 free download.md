**Publisher's Description**  
  

Striver is a memory based game, where the computer displays a sequence of
colors and you have to click on the same colors in the exact same sequence.

The computer keeps gradually increasing the number of colors, making it harder
to remember the sequence. As you go higher, the computer also displays the
colors faster [Simon Says Clone].
