**Publisher's Description**  
  


Astrorocks is an Asteroids clone made with the EGSL interpreter. It is a fully playable game and shows what is possible with EGSL. Due to the pixel perfect collision one needs a rather modern PC, I would recommend at least a dual core processor. 

Linux versions of the game are available on the homepage.

**WhatA's New in version 1.1:**

  * visually enhanced with some particles
