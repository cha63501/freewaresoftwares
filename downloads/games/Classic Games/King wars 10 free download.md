**Publisher's Description**  
  

King Wars is a network chess game only for two players. This game can be
played through internet, but I recommend through some VPN (Virtual Private
Network) for example Hamachi. In game are programmed all official chess rules,
various settings for displaying chessboard and communication between players
is encrypted.
