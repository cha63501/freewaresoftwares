itA's enhanced with the automatic clearing around feature. Ever get sick of
the endless clicking all over the place just to get everything "cleared
around"? Just tick the "Automatic Clearing Around" option in the Game menu and
Minesweeper Easy will do the clicking for you, while you concentrate on the
real job at hand - flagging the mines instead of wasting time frantically
clicking around. Other features like unlimited size game field and random game
