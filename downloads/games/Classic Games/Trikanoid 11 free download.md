**Publisher's Description**  
  

Trikanoid is a remake of the famous Arkanoid arcade game, from the 80A's. All
features of the original game have been implemented, like all the different
power-ups, the annoying, but sometimes useful aliens and such.

Since both the main authors did own a ZX Spectrum back in time, emphasis has
been put on implementing some of the uniqueness of the ZX Spectrum
implementation that were released for this machine.

Instead of making a true nostalgically remake of Arkanoid (Monochrome
graphics, synthetic sounds), the aim of Trikanoid was to implement the same
idea on modern computers of today.

**Features:**

  * 33 different levels 
  * End of game monster (Doh) at level 33 
  * Lots of powerups 
  * Stunning graphics 
  * Different background for each level 
  * Animations 
  * Graphical effects 
  * High quality music 
  * 8 different in game music scores 
  * 8 diffent in game soundscapes 
  * 4 additional scores, for menu, game won etc. 
  * Gripping sound effects and voices 
  * A cool A'old schoolA' intro to the game 
  * And a lot of other goodies
