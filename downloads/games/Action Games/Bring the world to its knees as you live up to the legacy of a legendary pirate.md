The legendary pirate Euchmich is dead, and as his iron grip on the fifteen seas is released, the world is thrown into turmoil. Several notorious pirates resurface to carve out their own dominions. 

Take up the role of EuchmichA's descendant and try to live up to his legacy. Square off against the usurpers, pillage and plunder your way across the seas, and terrorize the coastal cities into submission as you rebuild the reign of fear.
