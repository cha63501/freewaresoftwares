**Publisher's Description**  
  


Scorch an Island - an addictive multiplayer tank game, based on the idea of Scorched Earth. The gameplay is simple - choose weapon, set angle, power and fire! The more distant the shoot is, the more points you score. The goal is to destroy all the competing tanks and get as much points as possible. 

The game features high detailed three-dimensional fully deformable environment and a lot of special effects. But for all that there is a really simple gameplay, typical for two-dimensional games.

The game supports hot-seat and LAN multiplayer modes with up to 8 players at once.
