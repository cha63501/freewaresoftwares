Throw a mouse in the air and watch how far it bounces. 

Good fun for feline lovers. Click on where it saysA CLICK HERE. The first click stops the mouse pointer arrow indicator. This sets the angle of the throw. The second click stops the power bar. For power, more is better. Try to get the meter to stop when itAs full to the right. 

The tricky part is getting the right angle. If the angle is more than 45 degrees, the mouse falls flat like how a real mouse falls. If the angle is 45 degrees or less, the mouse bounces like a ball and travels amazing distances. Points are scored by how far the mouse gets thrown. Try to get the mouse pointer arrow indicator to stop at 45 degrees and stop the meter at its maximum. 

Then, watch the mouse bounce over distances of 350 feet. You have 5 tries in each round to throw the mouse. The final score is the total points of the 5 tries. If you can score 300 points, you are a grand master of Mouse Throwing.
