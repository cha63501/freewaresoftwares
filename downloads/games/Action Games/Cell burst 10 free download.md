**Publisher's Description**  
  

So you get to customize your own Cell. Start off with a name. Body color and
the head color come next. Afro or Spartan helmet on top? Or just a slim pair
of shades? Now you pick the level. Do you want to duke it out on the moon, or
hit and run on the pyramids? DonA't forget level difficulty. YouA'll probably
have to start out on Granny - only fools enjoy getting whipped on Extreme.

Make sure you decide whether you want to play Capture-the-Flag or a just a
round of the good olA'Brawl. ThereA's also Survivor mode. And five others, but
whoA's counting? You wonA't worry about weapons; there will be plenty to
choose from. Oh yeah. DonA't forget to pick the color you bleed; because when
the flamethrower gets you, thatA'll be the only thing that shows.
