**Publisher's Description**  
  


Fight robots using your sword as you hunt for your arch enemy. 

**Background story:**

"The two rivals, Master Jikah and Sinith Majoo, had been battling for almost two long years. JiKah was an experienced ninja, and Majoo was a strong-minded wizard. Both of them were very strong and very skilled at fighting. Only JiKah and Majoo knew the reason why they were fighting each other. Spectators could had to guess the answer. As the battle went on, Master JiKah felt that he was weaker than Sinith Majoo. It was something about MajooA's magical powers that made it almost impossible for JiKah to even hit him. 

One day, JiKah lost the battle. He didnA't die, but he surrendered. Sinith Majoo spared his life, but sent him into another dimension, a dimension called the Clouds Kingdom. Master JiKah was weak and had no knowledge about magic, so he was forced to climb the clouds to find a way out. It took him several days before he finally found a portal out of Clouds Kingdom. JiKah felt the anger rise inside of him, and he wanted to claim revenge on his opponent in a final battle. But then he would need to search the mighty lands of Rakast. 

After he had rested a while, JiKah resumed his search for Majoo in Rakast. The adventure went on, and he went through a bunch of portals before he finally found the room where Sinith Majoo was hiding, but he wasnA't there. Instead there was an open portal in the centre of the room and Master JiKah decided to enter it. He had nothing to loose. He would do everything to claim the revenge on Sinith Majoo..." 

**Gameplay:**

If you ever played the first two games in the Clouds Kingdom series, youA'll probably know that they didnA't include any enemies or action at all. Both of them were all about jumping and avoiding stuff. Gladly I am to announce the biggest addition in the last sequel; action. 

In Clouds Kingdom 3, JiKah encounters enemies, which is a perfect opportunity to practice his skills with the sword. But he will also get to use Throwing stars and learn new abilities throughout the game. 

The game is split up in chapters, and each chapter has a final boss. This means that there are no possibilities to rush through the game. But to make sure that the player (you) donA't skip the enemies to just face the bosses, a score system has been implemented. To earn score you can kill enemies. Depending on the difficulty of the enemy, the more score youA'll get. You can also collect the diamonds that lay scattered all over the game. Now is time for you to earn everyoneA's respect by getting the highest score on the online highscore list. 

**What's New in version 1.5:**

  * New Sword Spin Attacker 
  * Contains a vast amount of bugfixes and updated gameplay from the original game released in 2005.
