**Publisher's Description**  
  

You play space pilot Jake Wright. Highly trained, renown for quick reflexes
and skill. You are chosen to fly the plans to the Saturn base. In order to
reach the base, you must traverse 6 deadly sectors of asteroids, each getting
progressively more difficult. Along the way, you must earn style points which
will result in extra lives and more handling spanners which increase the ships
handling. Your ship is controlled with either the cursor keys or joystick.

**NOTE:** Although you are told to press A'FireA' to proceed in many areas of the game, you do not actually have weapons. This is a A'dodge-em-upA' so you cannot destroy the asteroids, merely dodge them with a much style as possible.
