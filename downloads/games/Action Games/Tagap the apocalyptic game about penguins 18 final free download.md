whole clone penguin army, lead by Pedro, another cyber-penguin. The fate of

TAGAP is a 2-D platformer shoot-em-up, but it plays more like a first-person
shooter than traditional genre game; Keyboard is for movement while guns are
handled with mouse, giving player 360 degrees firing freedom. While the same
control scheme has been used in games like Walker and Abuse, TAGAP having
bigger emphasis on shooter than platforming.
