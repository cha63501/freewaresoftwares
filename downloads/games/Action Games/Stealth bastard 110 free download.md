**Publisher's Description**  
  

Stealth games are awesome. Hiding from The Man, skulking in shadows, the
thrill of the unseen infiltration. But why do they have to be so... slow?

Introducing Stealth Bastard: stealth, with a great big kick up the arse. A
fast-paced, frenetic, one-step-away-from-chunky-death melange of sneaking,
platforming, hacking and cursing. A whole lot of fun. ItA's like Metal Gear
Solid and Super Meat Boy had a baby out of wedlock. Semi-literally.

Jump, sneak, and be horribly dismembered through 28 levels hand-crafted by our
crack team of in-house design geniuses, some of the same folk behind the
critically-acclaimed Fluidity/Hydroventure, and the retro-styled PSN
platformer Explodemon!

And once youA're done with those? Fear not - Stealth Bastard includes a FULL
in-game level editor - the same we used to create the bundled levels - and
even allows you to share, play and rate the communityA's creations from across
the world.

And if you thought that was cool, weA've not even got to the best bit yet:
Stealth Bastard is free. Not A'freemiumA'. Completely free.
