**Publisher's Description**  
  

Welcome to Cypher. A corrupt government controls Mars as corporations sell
oxygen at a premium. You are an agent with an incredible skill set determined
to eliminate the system. Taking information is how you will do it;
unfortunately, other organizations are seeking what you are. They will stop at
nothing to steal the valuable data you hack...

The plot of Cypher is the overthrow of the tyrannical Martian government. In
the not-too-distant future, colonization of Mars has been completed and the
new government is being influenced by evil corporations. These organizations
are rife with corruption and greed. The populace seems to not notice or care,
lulled into a false sense of complacency by the media as their freedoms are
stripped from them. From the darkness, a collection of underground computer
hackers emerges to find valuable secret information which can lead to the
downfall of the destructive forces that have taken over the planet. YOU are
one such hacker, bent on revenge and justice, trying to bring about that
change.

Throughout the civilian world are public-access terminals. Using a special
device, you are able to hack into secured networks and steal secrets from the
government. They will try to stop you at every turn, killing anyone they track
down carrying their secrets with their murderous orbital satellites. Competing
agents, out to make a name for themselves or representing different agencies,
will also attempt to kill you to slow you down or profit off your hard work.
Working alone, or in covert teams, with a host of technology on your side, you
are able to overcome these challenges, collecting data you will be able to one
day use and open the eyes of all civilians and expose the lies of those in
power.

Cypher Beta 3 was released September 2013, and features an updater system to
keep players up to date with the latest version. There are dedicated servers,
as well as an integrated chat and game network.
