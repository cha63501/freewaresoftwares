**Publisher's Description**  
  


Attack Of The Bulldozers is a very addictive multiplayer game for up to four players that involves driving a bulldozer around and shooting/ramming your opponents to death. Power-ups temporarily increase playersA' speed, give them bigger explosions, more health, extra grenades, or invincibility. 

This game runs on Windows operating systems, and it is recommended for computers with at least 2Ghz processors, although it will run on slower computers. 

Controls for player 1 are A,W,S,D, and E. Player 2A's controls are I,J,K,L, and O. Player 3A's controls are the arrow keys and 0 on the numpad, and player 4A's controls are 8,4,5,6, and 9 on the numpad. Escape quits.
