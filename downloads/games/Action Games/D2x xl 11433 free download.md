**Publisher's Description**  
  

D2X-XL is an enhanced version of D2X, the OpenGL modification of the classic
6dof shooter game Descent 2.

D2X-XL is available for MS Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. It is well documented
and maintained. Although D2X-XL contains a lot of enhancements and new
features, it is still fully backwards compatible to every other Descent 2
version. As many fixes restore features of the original Descent 2 that were
missing in D2X (like availability of all cockpit views, or working mouse
steering), it is even closer to them than D2X itself.

Linux and MacOS versions are available from the [developerA's
website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/d2x-xl/).

**Requires:**

  * Descent 2 
  * 3D graphics card 

**What's New in version 1.14.33:**

  * Monsterball didn't respawn in its initial location after a team has scored. 
  * Re-simplified hit detection and collision handling (standard hit detection includes standard collision handling, advanced hit detection means advanced collision handling).
