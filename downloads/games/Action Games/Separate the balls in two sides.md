**Publisher's Description**  
  


In this game there will be balls of two colours bouncing on two sides of the screen. Between the two sides there is an opening, you need to control the opening so that each side contains balls of the same colour. If you cannot separate the balls within a time limit, then you lost. As the game progresses there will be more balls and it will be increasingly difficult to separate them. Use the mouse to control the position of the opening.
