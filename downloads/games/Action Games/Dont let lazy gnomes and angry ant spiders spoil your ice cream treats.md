**Publisher's Description**  
  


Tom Khas loves ice cream so much that he takes on the job of frozen dessert customizer at the famous Cold Comfort ice cream parlor. 

Sadly the job turns out to be far from how he envisioned it. With ice cream servings so massive they must be prepared in a sub zero environment, and hygiene so bad it wouldnA't pass any scrutiny, Tom ends up by himself in a gigantic freezer, preparing the treats outside the customersA' view. 

Work would be much easier if Tom was left alone to do his thing. Unfortunately, he has to contend with ice cream ant-spiders, lazy and erratic freezer gnomes and an extremely demanding work pace. With no kind of job security, any mistake could be enough to get him fired.
