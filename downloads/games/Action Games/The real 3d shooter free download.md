**Publisher's Description**  
  

This simple 3D shooter was literally written in in a matter of minutes.
HereA's the story from the author:

"Some time ago a friend told me about a Computer-Game University somewhere
overseas, and there they learn how to write a 3D shooter within 15 minutes.
Many repetitions later I had enough of it and said: A'No problem for me.A'

Here is the result: True, the engine was finished within 15 minutes, but
pixeling the mouse cursor lasted at least the same time, not to mention the
sound effects... :-) Under DOS, the setting for the SoundBlaster is read from
the BLASTER= -Variable if available, if not it uses the default settings Port
220, Irq 5, DMA 1. Without a SoundBlaster compatible card it wonA't run at
all. Needs at least a 80386 (DOS) or any PC with DirectX (Windows)"
