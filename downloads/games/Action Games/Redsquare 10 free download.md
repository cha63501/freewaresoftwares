**Publisher's Description**  
  

RedSquare is a classic 2D action game for Windows (95, 98, 2000/XP, Vista, 7).
Click and hold the red square. Now, move it so that you neither touch the
walls nor get hit by any of the blue blocks. If you make it to 31 seconds, you
are doing brilliantly! Special thanks to my family for their support during
the development of this game.

**Features:**

  * 2D gameboard with special graphical effects. 
  * Easy menu system. 
  * Mouse control 
  * Nice sound effects
