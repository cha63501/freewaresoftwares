**Publisher's Description**  
  

This game was completed in 2004, but failing to find a suitable publisher,
Trail blazer almost ended never seeing light of day. Almost, because Shadowbit
decided to release it for free, so here you have it. :)

**The game**:  
You start out with a broken down hovercraft roughly the shape of an old cab.
Each game gathers three pilots trying to kill one another in an arena. How?
Each vehicle leaves a beam trail that damages anything that passes through it.
So you have to drive fast trying to circle or corner other contestants with
your beam while avoiding theirs, also being careful not to hit the arena wall
or other vehicles.

As you win games, you get money to upgrade or trade your hover for a different
one. Different hovers have different strengths and weaknesses.

"Here is one developer team that keeps the old-school feel in mind yet
nowadays, favoring addictive and innovative gameplay over ultra-realistic
graphics and sounds." (According to Abandoneer.com)
