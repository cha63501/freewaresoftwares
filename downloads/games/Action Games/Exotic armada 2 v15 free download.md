**Publisher's Description**  
  

Exotic Armada 2 offers some fast-paced spacecraft melee action for 1-4 players
(on the same computer). The game isnA't even meant to be innovative, rather
just offering pure shooting fun in the spirit of games such as Star Control.
There are a total of 56(!) different ships to choose from, each with unique
graphics and armament, ranging from tiny scout vessels to huge battleships.
You get to build a custom armada, then put it to use in a real-time combat
arena. Team games are also supported, along with easy/hard AI players.

In the beginning you only have 6 light ships available. The rest of the ships
need to be unlocked by completing challenges, which are basically just matches
versus an AI. As you complete challenges, you gradually unlock new ships while
learning their strengths and weaknesses. You can also team up with a partner
to complete the challenges together.

If youA're a fan of spacecraft melee type games, you should definitely try
Exotic Armada 2.

**Requirements:** 1280x1024 capable display, 600MHz CPU, 256MB RAM, 32MB VRAM.
