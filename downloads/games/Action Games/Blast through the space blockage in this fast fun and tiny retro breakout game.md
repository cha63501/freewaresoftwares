**Publisher's Description**  
  


Blast through the space blockage in this retro arcade game. ItA's simple to grasp but difficult to master: Control the bat with the mouse to knock the ball against the blocks. Clear a level and advance to the next, but drop the ball and you lose a life. 

**Features:**

  * Colourful full-screen graphics (VGA mode 13h). 
  * Smooth paralax scrolling starfield background. 
  * Written entirely in 8086 assembler for lightning fast gameplay and tiny file size (~8kb). 
  * Compatible with MS-DOS and all desktop versions of Windows. Requires a mouse driver, 0.008MB of RAM & disk space. 

**Blocks:**

  * Normal Blocks: These are your basic ball fodder. They break easily, but there are a lot of them about. 
  * Toggle Block: These vanish on contact without exploding, only to pop back into existence seconds later. Thankfully, you donA't need to destroy them in order to pass a level, but they may get in your way. 
  * Stubborn Block: These require a good deal of battering before theyA'll give way. 
  * Steel Block: These are completely indestructible.
