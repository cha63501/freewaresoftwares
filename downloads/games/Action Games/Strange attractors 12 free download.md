**Publisher's Description**  
  

Strange Attractors is a space-based action game in which you activate a
gravity drive to interact with objects in the game, in order to sling yourself
into a portal.

Strange Attractors was created for a A'One SwitchA' competition. Just because
the only button used by the game is the space bar (and Esc to exit) doesnA't
mean the gameplay isnA't complex and unique. Remember, not everything that is
simple is easy!

By pressing the spacebar, you activate the gravity drive of your craft and
create an attractive force between yourself and the other objects in the game.
Your goal is to sling and bounce yourself from the bottom of the level through
the portal at the top.

Strange Attractors has been nomimated for Most Innovative Game by the
Independent Games Festival.
