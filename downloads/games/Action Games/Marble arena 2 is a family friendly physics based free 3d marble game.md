**Publisher's Description**  
  


Marble Arena 2 is a family friendly, physics based, free 3D marble game, featuring vibrant HD graphics, fun and addictive gameplay, and an easy to use built-in editor for creating custom levels. 

The game features 50 mayhem filled levels, where players will test their skills on several types of surfaces, attempt to master a multitude of physics contraptions and go toe to toe, and sometimes toe to multiple toes, with A.I. controlled enemies bent on preventing players from achieving their goals.

Making it through all these perils in one piece, and in time, has its benefits. Players will be awarded upgrade points for doing so, points that they can use to improve their skills or unlock their favorite from a multitude of marble skins.

If single player action is just not enough action, the game provides a fun multiplayer experience, with a dedicated server running 24/7 and gives anyone the ability to host their own server and play with their friends.

Creative players are given all the tools theyAll need to create their own levels, in the form of the built in editor. A quick, fun and easy to use set of tools meant to allow anyone to bring their mayhem inducing ideas to life in a matter of minutes and play them right away.
