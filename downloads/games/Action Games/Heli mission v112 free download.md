**Publisher's Description**  
  

Your mission (if you choose to accept) is to rescue prisoners of war (POWA's)
from enemy territory.  
  
Fly your helicopter into one of the three "hotzones" and pick up the POWA's
and bring them safely back to your homebase.  
  
You must defend your helicopter againts enemy air-to-air attacks from attack
helicopters (screenshot 3) and defend your helicopter against enemy ground-to-
air attacks from troopers on the ground(screenshot 4).  
  
The difficulty of the game will increase with each level you advance (no level
limit).  
  
The last two hotzones in the game, will be unlocked as you advance in level.  
  
Please try to avoid shooting the POWA's, this isnA't Lemmings!!  
  
All the screenshots can be found on the developerA's website.  
  
The game requires DirectX.  
  
Version 1.12  
Fixed a keyboard bug, where the keys to control the direction of the heli
could get stuck.  
  
Fixed a window size bug, some of the heli mission window became hidden by the
Windows taskbar.
