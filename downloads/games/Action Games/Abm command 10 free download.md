**Publisher's Description**  
  

ABM Command is a classic missile defense arcade game.

Your mission is to protect the innocent civilians in the 6 cities in your
sector from the nuclear ICBMA's of a maniacal anti-American, Third-World
dictator, whoever weA're against this week. You do this by launching your own
nuclear ABMA's to fly into the path of the incoming missiles and detonate,
destroying everything within the nuclear burst.

The missiles come in waves and get faster and more numerous as the game
progresses. After a few waves, SmartBombs begin to come in. SmartBombs can see
the nuclear bursts and hover or dodge around them, and some of them can fly
thru nuclear bursts for short periods.

Occasionally, you will see Multiple, Independently-targeted, Re-entry Vehicles
(MIRVA's). MIRVA's are special warheads which look normal until they are
triggered, causing them to split into several warheads, all aimed at different
cities! The game is over when all your cities have been destroyed (even if you
have ABM sites).
