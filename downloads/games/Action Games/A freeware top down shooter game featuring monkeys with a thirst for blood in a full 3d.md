**Publisher's Description**  
  


Kong is a freeware top-down shooter game featuring monkeys with a thirst for blood in a full 3D environment. The rules are simple, pick up as many health/armor packs and weapons as you can before blowing your enemies into smithereens. 

The game currently features three game modes including deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag with plans to introduce a number of new game modes.
