**Publisher's Description**  
  

Neva is a futuristic hybrid between an action platformer and an action
puzzler. Each time when you have completed the platforming stage (in which you
jump, fly, fight and run) you get to the puzzle segment. In the puzzle stage
you have to hit the right buttons at the right timeA

To understand the gameplay mechanics it is highly recommend to play through
the tutorial before you start the game.

The game has overall great production values and features really nice
animations, futuristic graphics with fine effects, an original soundtrack,
nice cut scenes which drives the story further and a nostalgic HUD which
reminds of the good old Amiga days.
