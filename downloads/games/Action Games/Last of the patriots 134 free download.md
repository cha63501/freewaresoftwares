Last Of The Patriots is the latest prototype from games veteran whose previous
experience includes GTA4, GTA-San Andreas, Manhunt and Manhunt2.

Last Of The Patriots is a prototype for future games that revolve around plot
and character and less on action, with an emphasis on deeper underlying
meaning. The main premise of the game is to show war in a realistic way never
before seen in games.

Last Of The Patriots is set in a dark future setting where a single
corporation dominates the galaxies. You will step in the role of Zeke Johnson,
a broken down ex-war hero set on self-destruction, as he drinks his life away
on colony LV-21. Through a strange twist of fate, Johnson is given a last
chance to redeem himself as he rejoins the space corps for one final decisive
mission.

The game uses cinematic techniques such as flashbacks, moral dilemmas, when
you are ordered to shoot innocent civilians, large scale battles.
