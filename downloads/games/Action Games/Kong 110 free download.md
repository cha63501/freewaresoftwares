**Publisher's Description**  
  

Kong is a freeware top-down shooter game featuring monkeys with a thirst for
blood in a full 3D environment. The rules are simple, pick up as many
health/armor packs and weapons as you can before blowing your enemies into
smithereens.

The game currently features three game modes including deathmatch, team
deathmatch and capture the flag with plans to introduce a number of new game
modes. Computer controlled bots are provided as target practise but the real
fun comes from playing in multiplayer over a local area network or the
internet.
