Why does the chicken cross the road? To catch the worm on the other side! 

To start, press the space bar. Use the directional keys to control the chicken. Avoid the cars or trucks. Get to the other side and eat the worm. Congratulations! You have cleared Level 1. Subsequent levels are more difficult. 

This chicken not only has to cross roads but rivers, or both. The worm is no longer on the other bank. You have to catch more than one worm. The final worm is on the other bank. To cross rivers, hop on the backs of tortoises and crocodiles to get across. Be careful. Sometimes, they dip under water and you will lose a life. ItAs best to jump on logs or boats when they appear. At any time, you may press the space bar to freeze the action. You cannot move in this mode but you can plot your path better when the traffic gets heavier and faster. Press the space bar again to resume action. When you are riding things on the river, be alert. If you go out of the screen, you lose a life. 

DonAt be a chicken. Play Chicken Crossing.
