**Publisher's Description**  
  

Fly through mountains and cave systems eliminating multiple enemies before
finally destroying the Pirate Base. Pick up weapons, shield and fuel power ups
along the way. Multiple levels, terrains and enemies.

Since the creation of trade routes between Earth and Mars (2120 AD) the
Aranaxus crime Syndicate have been pirating the cargo vessels. Recent
intelligence has uncovered what appears to be a pirate base, located in a cave
system on the far side of the Moon. Take the new A220 and scout out the base.
Fly into the cave system and if possible destroy it.

As you know from testing the A220, this is our most advanced attack vehicle
incorporating the newly invented shield generator system. With the ability to
pick up weapon upgrades, Fuel and Shield cells in flight, a team of operatives
have been sent ahead to place these within the cave system. Be sure to pick up
the upgrades and make full use of them. I donA't need to remind you how much
the government has invested in the A220 so be careful with it and Good Luck !
