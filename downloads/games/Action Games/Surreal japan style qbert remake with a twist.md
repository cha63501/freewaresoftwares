**Publisher's Description**  
  


In this slightly modified Q*Bert clone you take the role of Plastic KittenA, the universeA's last line of defense against the evil forces of VolksmusikA. To save the world, you have been transported into the cybermatic brain of the evil leader of this movement, Dr. Hi-No. 

Inside his brain you must activate the atomic power within the molecubes to destroy the cybertronic levels around Dr. Hi-NoA's brain core. Once you activated all molecubes in a room, it destructs itself and you are automatically transported to the next one. There are five levels, each has four rooms.

Can you make it to the last room, conquer Dr. Hi-NoA's alter ego and save the world? The hope of zillions of brain-washed disco-maniacs rests on your sexy shoulders!
