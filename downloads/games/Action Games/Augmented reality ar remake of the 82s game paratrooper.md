Augmented reality (AR) remake of the 82As game Paratrooper. 

The rules of the game are simple A you shall not let paratroopers land. But in this remake you do not need a gun A you can destroy paratroopers with your fingers, hands, heads and etc. The only thing you need is a webcam. 

Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that combines live video and virtual objects. No specific remote controls are required for ruling the game. Player just needs a webcam preferably with 640x480 res, and operating at 30 frames per second minimum. Unfortunately not all laptop set-in webcams provide the expected quality. 

By the game rules you shall destroy spy paratroopers, with no violence but just moving them away beyond the screen. To get to the next level you need to gather a certain number of bonus smiles. You can play the game with everything you like A fingers, hands, heads, other assistant objects. 

Please note that the playing style may change depending on the distance between you and the camera. This game is created after one of the oldest PC games Paratrooper, which in its turn is said to be created after one of the first Apple games - Sabbotage. 

You need a webcam to play the game. Please make sure it is plugged in and in operation.
