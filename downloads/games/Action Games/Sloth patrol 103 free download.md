**Publisher's Description**  
  

Sloth Patrol is a fast paced twin stick shooter and the most realistic sloth-
based video game ever conceived. The game combines elements of bullet-hell
shoot emA' ups with the frantic action synonymous with twin stick shooters.

In addition to a story driven campaign mode, Sloth Patrol features a
competitive survival mode with online ranking. Players lead sloth space pilot
Julio Treewalker in the defense of his home world of Slothonia. Opposing Julio
is the evil Colonel Hisser, leader of the Possum Empire.

Sloth Patrol allows players to rate their performance against others via an
online scoring system.

A gamepad is recommended to fully enjoy Sloth Patrol, however, the game also
supports the use of the keyboard/mouse.
