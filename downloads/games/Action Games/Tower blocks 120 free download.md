**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this game you need to build a tower that is as tall as possible. Blocks
will hang from the top and when you click the mouse button, the block will
drop down. If it fails to land on the block beneath, then you lose a block and
when you loses three blocks, the game will be over. If you manage to drop the
block perfectly on the block beneath, then you get extra bonus scores. As the
tower gets taller it will start to shake and the taller it gets, the wider it
shakes, making the dropping of new blocks more difficult.
