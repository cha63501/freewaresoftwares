**Publisher's Description**  
  

Augmented reality (AR) remake of the 82As game Paratrooper.

The rules of the game are simple A you shall not let paratroopers land. But in
this remake you do not need a gun A you can destroy paratroopers with your
fingers, hands, heads and etc. The only thing you need is a webcam.

Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that combines live video and virtual
objects. No specific remote controls are required for ruling the game. Player
just needs a webcam preferably with 640x480 res, and operating at 30 frames
per second minimum. Unfortunately not all laptop set-in webcams provide the
expected quality.

By the game rules you shall destroy spy paratroopers, with no violence but
just moving them away beyond the screen. To get to the next level you need to
gather a certain number of bonus smiles. You can play the game with everything
you like A fingers, hands, heads, other assistant objects.

Please note that the playing style may change depending on the distance
between you and the camera. This game is created after one of the oldest PC
games Paratrooper, which in its turn is said to be created after one of the
first Apple games - Sabbotage.

You need a webcam to play the game. Please make sure it is plugged in and in
operation.
