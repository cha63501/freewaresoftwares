**Publisher's Description**  
  


The object of Bokarium is to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. You control the red turret that starts in the middle while the enemies are the yellow turrets. Use the "ARROW" keys to control the movement of the player and the "SPACE BAR" to fire at the enemies. You get one point for each enemy destroyed and you start with three lives. When lives are reduced to zero the game ends. Pressing "ESC" will end the game. Bokarium is Copyright 2005 Dunamis Games. All rights reserved. Created by Jason Coggins.
