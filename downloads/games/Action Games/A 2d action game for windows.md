**Publisher's Description**  
  


RedSquare is a classic 2D action game for Windows (95, 98, 2000/XP, Vista, 7). Click and hold the red square. Now, move it so that you neither touch the walls nor get hit by any of the blue blocks. If you make it to 31 seconds, you are doing brilliantly! Special thanks to my family for their support during the development of this game. 

**Features:**

  * 2D gameboard with special graphical effects. 
  * Easy menu system. 
  * Mouse control 
  * Nice sound effects
