**Publisher's Description**  
  


Army of Earth is an online action/strategy team combat game, allowing hundreds of players and up to 6 teams to play together in an open, outdoor 3D environment. It is easy to learn and use, with mouse-based controls, yet provides deep gameplay. It is a TEAM game and mastery will require not only team strategic thinking but also leadership skills. 

It is fully 3D, but has very modest graphics requirements; it should run fine on the majority of laptops. Gameplay is drop-in/drop-out, so there is no waiting for players. Built-in lobbies provide convenient matchmaking, and ranked games are tracked in the Elo-based leaderboard. The maps are created procedurally, which means they never repeat, the download is small, and there are no loading delays. The game has low bandwidth requirements and is also latency-tolerant. 

This is an online-only game; there is no single-player component. Bots are used to fill out the game while the player-base grows. Please get involved and join our community! 

Army of Earth is now in Open Beta and will be free to play throughout the Beta period.
