**Publisher's Description**  
  

It is the year 2084. You control a secret organization charged with defending
Earth from a brutal alien enemy. Build up your bases, prepare your team, and
dive head-first into the fast and flowing turn-based combat.

UFO: Alien Invasion is a squad-based tactical strategy game in the tradition
of the old X-COM PC games, but with a twist. Our game combines military
realism with hard science-fiction and the weirdness of an alien invasion. The
carefully constructed turn-based system gives you pin-point control of your
squad while maintaining a sense of pace and danger.

Over the long term you will need to conduct research into the alien threat to
figure out their mysterious goals and use their powerful weapons for your own
ends. You will produce unique items and use them in combat against your
enemies. If you like, you can even use them against your friends with our
multiplayer functionality.

UFO: Alien Invasion. Endless hours of gameplay A absolutely free.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from the X-COM series by Mythos and
Microprose. However, itA's neither a sequel nor a remake of any X-COM or other
commercial title. What we as a team wanted to make is a brand new experience
that tries to surpass the quality of games from 1992, rather than simply
recreate them with flashier graphics.
