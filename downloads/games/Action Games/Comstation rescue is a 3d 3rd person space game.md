**Publisher's Description**  
  


ComStation Rescue is a 3D, 3rd Person Space Game. The Wymacet Horde is back and they have captured ComStation C12. You must eliminate all Horde Warriors from C12. If you leave even one, you mission has failed! 

Use your arrow keys to ascend/descend and your mouse for direction, firing (left mouse button), and acceleration (right mouse button). When you destroy a fighter ship, you are able to pick up its energy core to add energy to your ship. However, if you shoot it before you get to it, you will not be able to add its energy to your ship, so be careful with your fire.
