**Publisher's Description**  
  

Toy Cars is a physics based 2-D racer. The game is based on AJupiterAs
MasterdriveA for Atari ST and AMicromachinesA for Super Nintendo. It is a top
down physics based car racing game. A track editor is included.

**There are three modes of play:**

  1. Timed Race: You just race around the track and try to get the best time you can. 
  2. Hot Potato: Inspired by an old arcade game I do not know the name of. One car has a bomb sitting on top of it. If you crash into this car the bomb jumps to your car. When the time runs out, the bomb explodes and the player carrying it explodes with it and loses the game thereby rendering the other players the winners. 
  3. Knock A'Em Out: Like in the old Micromachines game on some old game consoles. All players are on the same screen, and the screen follows the player in the lead. If you go off the screen you are knocked out. All players are restarted once there is one player left. When all players except one are knocked out the remaining player earns one point. 

Many vehicles per game can take part, some human controlled, some computer
controlled.

Support for the XBox 360 Gamepad and the PS3 Gamepad has been implemented.

**Keyboard Controls:**

  * Player 1: arrow keys 
  * Player 2: w,s,a,d 
  * Player 3: i,k,j,l 
  * Player 4: 8,5,4,6 (on the keypad) 
If there are more than two human controlled players in the game, then auto
acceleration will be enabled. In this case the use of the accelerate key will
be unnecessary. Run toycars -h to see a list of available command line
options.
