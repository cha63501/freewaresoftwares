**Publisher's Description**  
  


This simple 3D shooter was literally written in in a matter of minutes. HereA's the story from the author: 

"Some time ago a friend told me about a Computer-Game University somewhere overseas, and there they learn how to write a 3D shooter within 15 minutes. Many repetitions later I had enough of it and said: A'No problem for me.A' 

Here is the result: True, the engine was finished within 15 minutes, but pixeling the mouse cursor lasted at least the same time, not to mention the sound effects... :-) Under DOS, the setting for the SoundBlaster is read from the BLASTER= -Variable if available, if not it uses the default settings Port 220, Irq 5, DMA 1. Without a SoundBlaster compatible card it wonA't run at all. Needs at least a 80386 (DOS) or any PC with DirectX (Windows)"
