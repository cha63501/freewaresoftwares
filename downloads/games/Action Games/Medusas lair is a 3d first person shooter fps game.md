MedusaA's Lair is a 3D first person shooter (FPS) game. You have entered MedusaA's Lair, a large, cavernous den crawling with MedusaA's evil spawn. You must fight your way through this confusing and winding lair to destroy Medusa. 

There are three masks hidden throughout the lair that will give you extra lives. Each time you kill a spawn, be sure to take the energy left behind because you will need it! Use your arrow keys and mouse to move, your left mouse button to fire, and your right mouse button to jump. Good Luck! MedusaA's Lair is now compatible with Windows Vista and is still completely free.
