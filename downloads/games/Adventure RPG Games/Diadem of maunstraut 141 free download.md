**Publisher's Description**  
  

Diadem of Maunstraut is the first full-length English fan game made with Sword
of Moonlight: The KingA's Field Making Tool. It is a first person perspective
action-RPG with a dark medieval setting. It is traditional to the KingA's
Field series only in controls and certain enemies, items and equipment; the
story and concepts differ as a fan made game.

The gameA's hero will explore a vast world to seek out: powerful weapons,
durable equipment, helpful items and potent spells in order to destroy the
source of evil throughout the land of Maunstraut. Many powerful evil
incarnations, as well as people who may (or may not) help you along the way
will be encountered in this long and perilous journey.

The game has a concept similar to the traditional KingA's Field games (and
other games of the series) as well as its own original soundtrack.
