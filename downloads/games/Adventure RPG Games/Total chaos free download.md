**Publisher's Description**  
  

You are RONALD JOHNSON, a seventeen year old kid who lives in Montane City.
Your birthday is approaching next week, and honestly, you couldnA't care less.
High School is pretty much over, and everyone else have these great lives
planned out for them....except for you. With no goals or ambitions in life,
you just drift along. You live each day waiting, waiting for that time when
your life becomes meaningful.

That evening, a sound is heard, drawing you and your best friend, JOSE
FERNANDEZ, back into the Abandoned Warehouse you previously explored earlier.
There, you meet a warrior from the Celestial Heavens, SQUAMUS MAXILLIUS, who
came to Earth to find the reincarnation of Prince DEVON MARS, who, one
thousand years ago, on his eighteenth birthday, sacrificed himself in order to
track down a dangerous enemy who escaped one thousand years into the
future......Earth.

Obviously, you are completely reluctant to follow this....talking dog ....to
go on some quest that, quite frankly, you donA't really care too much about to
begin with. Unfortunately, you are not given a choice when SOCIETY, a secret
group of criminals, begin to put their ultimate plan into motion. Chaos begins
to emerge, and lives are forever changed as the world slowly begins to slip
into a chaotic state. It is now up to Ron, Jose, Squamus, and many, many
others to find Society and stop them before the world is thrown into total,
absolute chaos.
