**Publisher's Description**  
  

Board game sounds like a boring static game where the die results are more
important than player skills. But .. Are you sure? The board may be a
reflection of the vibrant world where the player can perform multiple actions
and choices. Everything depends on the character classes, skills, and items
that you select.

You can fight in the arena to earn some money and experience or you can search
for the job in the mill. Create your own weapons and sell them in the city.
Work in the mine to extract some gems and gold. Fight against hundreds of
enemies and collect herbs to heal yourself. Bail your friend out of prison.
Use a broom to clean up the abandoned house and rest there. Steal money and
prey to Gods for forgiveness.

Just choose nine skills to create your character. Choose them wisely, because
a lot of challenges awaits you. This is a short description of the game
Srututu-Forgotten Foe.
