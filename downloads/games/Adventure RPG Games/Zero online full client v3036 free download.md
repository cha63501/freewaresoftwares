**Publisher's Description**  
  

In the world of Zero, the players no more play as warriors or mages in a
desolate land but the pilots who master high-tech weapons, fighting in the
immense universe. Shuttling between the numerous galaxies, the units of
various forms and functions are navigated by the pilots to fight against
ferocious alien enemies. It is an epic war: battling for the Earth Alliance is
the pilotsA' ultimate honor and eternal duty.

**Features:**

**Mech-Warriors**  
Zero Online offers various units of incredible power for the players to pilot.
To survive under varying battle conditions, these units are classified into
three types: Infantry, Artillery and Psyche. Infantry units use hand to hand
weaponry such as swords and scythes. Artillery units excel at long-distance
attacks, and the super guns are their favorite weapons. Psyche Unit has a
unique gear system, and they use specially designed bows, armor, and
thrusters.

**A.R.M.**  
In Zero, the A.R.M.(Automated Reserve Mech) system was created to meet the
playersA' expectation of multi-units! The A.R.M. system allows a pilot to
operate 3 units at the same time. When the main unit reaches level 100 and
level 145, player can get the first and the second A.R.M.

**Fusion System**  
Subversively new type of skill! You can fuse your unit with the ARMs-the
Fusion Skill. You will see with your own eyes that technology really is full
of surprises. It is not but a dream for you to own an awesome Fusion Unit any
more.

**Transformation System**  
Both Infantry and Artillery units can transform into various units ranging
from a powerful gun to a dinosaur. You can transform your unit as you see fit.
Each transformation not only changes your shape, but can reinforce your
strength, provide a wider attack range or a faster attack speed, etc. The
transformation process is fully explained during game play.

**Equipment Upgrade System**  
The multi-upgrade of equipment is also a feature in ZERO!

There are many mysterious gems in the world of Zero which are classified into
four types, dependant on their effects: Potency Gems, Exp Gems, Attack Gems
and Defense Gems. The energy of these gems is unstable, so they can only be
socketed into specific equipment.

**Core System**  
The core system is one of best ZeroA's features. There are 10 core types and
one special core in the game. Each type has an exclusive core program and
features. They are absolutely necessary armament for our heroes.

**Fleet & Squad System**  
In order to stimulate the mech-merc industry and ward against monopolies, the
Earth Alliance promotes and rewards pilots for cooperation as well as
competition. As such they have created a system through which pilots can
organize themselves into FLEETS and SQUADS. They provide an extended family of
sorts which is something of great value out in the Big Empty.

**Mission System**

our pilots are such as Newcomer Mission, Zone Mission, Spaceship mission,
Daily Mission, Weekend Routine Missions and so on, that means you will never
