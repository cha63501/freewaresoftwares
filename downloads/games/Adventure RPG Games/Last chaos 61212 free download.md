Last Chaos is an on-line role playing game where thousands of players can
simultaneously be connected, fight and upgrade their courage and battle skills
through adventures, quests and crafting skills with fellow adventurers.

Set in the land of Iris, a place where anarchy, terror and ambition reign
after an epic struggle between the Gods, players must use their skill and
cunning to unite Iris and become its supreme ruler. Players acquire bravery,
intelligence and strength to become the true emperor by accomplishing
missions, learning crafting skills and experiencing adventures in the huge and
unknown world.

In Last Chaos, players can go fight individually or team up in groups to fight
monsters, other players, or complete quests. They can also form guilds and
battle against other guilds for bragging right and supremacy over Iris.
