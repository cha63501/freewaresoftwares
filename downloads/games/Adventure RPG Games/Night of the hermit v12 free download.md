Hermit can run on both DOS and Windows systems.

If youA've ever played any of the classic point-and-click adventure games
youA'll feel right at home with Night of the Hermit.

It has now been 8 years since that pesky Guybrush left the Island. Herman has
spent all of the money that he earned from that game, and things have started
looking pretty bleak. Then one day a message in a bottle shows up, saying that
his grandfather has died and left him his big mansion on Badger Island,
somewhere in the Caribbean. So with visions of starting a new life, Herman
packs his few belongings and sets out to claim his inheritance. But the thing
about bottle mail is that itA's slow, very slow. So by the time Herman gets to
Badger Island, he finds that someone claimed the mansion years ago, and turned
it into the sleazy Crippled Badger Motel. Herman decides to spend everything
that he has left (which is 12 dollars, 45 cents, and some moss) for one night
at the motel, determined to find a way to reclaim what is rightfully his. And
this is his story.

Night of the Hermit has been downloaded over 14,000 times according to Wired
