By the development of the overlightspeed propulsion system they had the possibility of establishing colonies on far distant planets and of building space stations. Man was so able to make half of the galaxy to his home. They also got in contact with the ApaAars, an extraterrestrial civilization that is living together with the humans in peace.  
  
But on the 25th of October an ApaAar ship A on board also a few humans A came across an alien race in space sector 57. Those beings, calling themselves Qeyons, declared war on the two allied civilizations. They have the intention of annexing the humansA and ApaAarsA resources and of enslaving them.
