**Publisher's Description**  
  


The Legendary Tales Engine is the program that is used for playing the adventures created with the Editor. Unlike many other text-based programs it does not have a command line and the user acts with the use of a well developed GUI. The Engine also supports the loading of pictures and maps for greater immersion into the game. Furthermore the player can control a party of up to 6 members. 

The Legendary Tales Editor is a visual editor for the creation of adventures. The author can add locations, connect them together and then fill them with content such as creatures, NPCs, items, weapons, containers. The use of scripting adds even greater flexibility allowing the author to dynamically manipulate the game and its course. For example the author can load maps and images when certain events happen, update the playerA's journal with new quests and journal entries, award quest experience points or items and program the dialog with the various NPCs.

What is more, the editor gives the opportunity to encrypt texts, images and data files to avoid cheating attempts by the users.
