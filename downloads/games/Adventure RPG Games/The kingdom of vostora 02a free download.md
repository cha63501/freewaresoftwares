**Publisher's Description**  
  

In a mystical world living in the shadows cast by the errors of ancient
warmongering nations, people live their lives as peacefully as one could
imagine; however, not all is as peaceful as it may seem.

Those who have the ancient birthright to wield the powers of the elements are
left with nothing more than prophetic dreams, and some plot secretly to revive
their mystical powers and do what they shouldA've done in the first place...
keep these powers out of the hands of those nations that would abuse them,
while the same kingdoms that might put the powers to use spend their own
resources to discover what really happened during the great war thousands of
years ago, which left the worldA's magical well tapped dry.

While such a state of affairs sounds like it is on the verge of tipping into
disaster, millennia have passed in this way with no progress made by either
side. However, one average woman will set off on a journey in an effort to
protect and save her friends from an unknown impending disaster, setting off a
sudden chain of events that could change the fate of their world and beyond
forever.

  * Herbalism items can no longer be purchased or sold. The primary way to obtain them will be finding them in pots/chests, drops from monsters, or by harvesting them. 
  * All references to herbs being bought or sold have also been removed, to the best of my knowledge. If you find any stray references in dialogue, please let me know so that I can remove them

  * Weak Ether and Ether are now called A'Weak Mana ChargeA' and A'Mana ChargeA' 
  * The price of Mana Charge items has been reduced (The effect of Mana Charge items will likely change in version 0.2.1) 
  * The Mana Charge items can no longer be purchased from Shuukaku, but will be reinstated in v0.2.1. If you already have some in your inventory, they will still be functional and will not be removed.
