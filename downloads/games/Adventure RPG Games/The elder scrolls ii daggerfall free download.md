**Publisher's Description**  
  

Bethesda Softworks is celebrating the 15th anniversary of The Elder Scrolls
series. In doing so, the company has released full version of The Elder
Scrolls II: Daggerfall as freeware.

The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall is the successor of The Elder Scrolls: Arena.
Daggerfall initially was developed using an updated Arena raycast engine
similar to DoomA's, where the world is really 2D and drawn to look 3D. We then
decided to begin development of one of the very first true 3D engines in
computer games -- the XnGine. This engine provided unparalleled 3D visuals and
would go on to power other titles such as The Terminator: Future Shock,
SkyNET, X-Car, Battlespire, and Redguard.

Daggerfall featured one of the first true 3D worlds on a massive scale, with a
game world the size of Great Britain. The game had twice as many features as
Arena, a deeper role-playing system, and helped usher in an RPG renaissance in
1996.

**Note from FreewareFiles.com:** To run this game on newer systems, you will need to download an emulation program like [DOSBox](http://www.freewarefiles.com/DOSBox_program_34452.html).
