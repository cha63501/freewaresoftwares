**Publisher's Description**  
  


C4LC the amnesiac android with the powers of a pocket calculator. Its sole mission is to gather the ones who can stop the numbers from invading our world, like: JESS, a Mathlete who always speaks her mind; DAVE, a failed Mathemagician who craves an audience; and DR. DIANE, a Polymath who canA't trust other people to get the job done. In this role-playing game, the numbers are your enemies and you use your MATH POWER to fight against them! 

Instead of having the traditional RPG monsters like: dragons, orcs, goblins, trolls, etc; here you will find Negative, Irrational and even Fractal numbers, for example. Moreover, the story and NPCs have their own flair which helps you to become more immersed in this strange universe where numbers exist as physical beings rather than mere abstractions.

If you chart a Venn Diagram, the intersection between RPG lovers and mathematics lovers will yield the answer to who would love to play this game.
