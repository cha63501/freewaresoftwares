**Publisher's Description**  
  

The game is in modern times, the year 2014. You are playing as Chad Daniels, a
rather "moody" teenage boy who, unfortunately, lost his mother to a disease.
His father ran out on him, and his Aunt is constantly sick.

Trying to be the best nephew you can be, you help your Aunt out by trying to
find her a pillow from your storage room...but...thereA's someone in your
storage room...a little boy.

You ask the little boy to identify himself, but instead, he screams and runs
off.

Confused by the weird event, you go check up on your Aunt...but sheA's gone,
and to make matters worse, you begin to hear monstrous sounds coming from your
front door. YouA're saved by an angel, who explains to you that the Kid is
actually the "Onyx Boy", the only one who knows the location of the Onyx, and
is the object of pursuit by many powerful forces. The angel calls you the
"Peditra", the only one who can connect with the Onyx Boy, and destroy the
Onyx.

So now youA're left with two options...help save the new world of Allumia,
which is nearly exactly like your old home...or, find a way back to your own
original world. Which one would you choose?
