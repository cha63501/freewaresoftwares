MuN is a campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons. Space travel. Technorganic humans. Aliens. A dying universe.   
  
None of these things totally describe MuN - but they come close.   
  
Emerge yourself in a realm of fantastic aliens, bizarre planets, awesome spaceships, and technology bordering on magic.   
  
What role will you choose? What species will you be? What planet will you claim as your own?   
  
Can you handle an entire universe full of danger?   
  
MuN. ItA's not a world. ItA's not a game. ItA's our future...
