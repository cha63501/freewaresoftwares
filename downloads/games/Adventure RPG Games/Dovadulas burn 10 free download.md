DovadulaA's Burn is a classic freeware graphic adventure game, developed in
Italian and English.

The character can pick up, use, talk and look at objects and characters within
an icons system behind the scrolling inventory on the top of the screen.

The puzzles of the game have a lot of objects, and the player can explore all
the locations from the beginning of the game.

The story takes place in the imaginary town of DovadulaA's, where Punkkommando
is trying to destroy the town with his bass guitar. The police stop
PunkkommandoA's plan and he runs away. Punkkommando loses his bass guitar, and
to escape to the policeman he assumes the identity of the crazy green man
Capitan Fortuna. Then he goes to his music master Matt Freeman to find a
method to definitively destroy DovadulaA's.
