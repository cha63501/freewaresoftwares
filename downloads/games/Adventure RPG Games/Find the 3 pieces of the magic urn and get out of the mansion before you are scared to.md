**Publisher's Description**  
  


Many years ago in the small town of Spirit Bay, there lived a mean old man named Zacharey Graves. Old man Graves was not a very well liked person. He rarely left the old mansion and spent most of his like brooding about the decaying house. When he died, the house was condemed and locked up. 

The townspeople claim that old man Graves knew the whereabouts of a magic urn that was a family heirloom of the first family of Spirit Bay. It seems that the mansion was the familyA's first home and that magic urn, which broke into several pieces during the earthquake of 1890, is still in the house.

To this day, no one has had the courage to go into the mansion to search for the pieces of the urn. It is common knowledge that the ghost of old man Graves still haunts the mansion. Some of the neighbors claim to have seen lights flickering in the windows. Some say they have heard eerie sounds, door slamming and heavy footsteps. Some even claim to have seen shadows running through the mansion.

The mysterious mansion has many rooms connected by corridors and staircases. Some of the rooms have been locked for over 50 years. There is supposed to be a master key hidden somewhere in the mansion. Without the key, it may be impossible to travel from room to room. There is an ancient sceptre hidden in the mansion. Old man Graves always carried this sceptre. He believed it scared off evil spirits.
