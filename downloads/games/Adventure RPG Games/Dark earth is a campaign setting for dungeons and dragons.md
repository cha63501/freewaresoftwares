**Publisher's Description**  
  


Dark Earth is a campaign setting unlike any you have ever played. It will take your imagination and grab it, caress it, and make you never want to leave.   
  
Just think: a world run by clans, each struggling to gain dominance over the other. Humans are cattle to a vampiric mutation of people calling themselves "vampires", and the few intelligent humans that do exist struggle to maintain their humanity in a world of true darkness.   
  
Imagine also if most of the world was wild, unexplored, and feared. What would you do? What clan would you choose? Would you be a human or vampire? Or maybe a mutation (BaA'at)? Or an artificially intelligent robot (Iod)?   
  
So many choices - the time to start making them is now.   
  
Dark Earth: ItA's more than just a campaign setting - itA's a spiritual awakening...
