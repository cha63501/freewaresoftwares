**Publisher's Description**  
  


DOFUS is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that has already seduced 30 million players (June 2010) worldwide.

The universe of DOFUS is a colourful fantasy world inspired by manga, which is drenched in magic and humour. The World of Twelve is named after the twelve gods who rule it, each with their chosen art. The goddess Eniripsa, for example, has infinite medical knowledge. Each character in the world of DOFUS is a disciple of one of these gods, and so there are twelve playable character classes.

**Story: A captivating adventure**

Since the disappearance of the precious Dofus, the province of Amakna has been in turmoil - and with good cause. The fantastic powers contained in these magic dragon eggs arouse lust in even the most chaste adventurers, and the two cities of Bonta and Brakmar are already in terrible conflict as a result. An even greater threat hangs over Amakna, however. 

Strange monsters suddenly appear amongst the rich flora and fauna, and land rises up where once there was featureless void. Wherever they come from, whatever their motivation or however events transpire, all adventurers share the same objective: to lay their hands on the 6 precious Dofus.
