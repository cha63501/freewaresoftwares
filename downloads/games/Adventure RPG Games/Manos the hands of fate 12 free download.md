Michael Downing and Margaret Peterson are the textbook examples of an All-
American couple. Forced to postpone their wedding due to severe rainfalls,
they seek shelter inside a lone Motel on the side of the road. Things take a
swift turn for the worst when the couple is separated and thrown into an
enormous labyrinth sitting underneath the motel. The twosome make it their
mission to reunite with each other, teaming up with two mysterious and quirky
individuals along the way. Will the young couple overcome the plethora of
