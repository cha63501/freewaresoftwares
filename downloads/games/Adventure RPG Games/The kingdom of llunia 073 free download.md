**Publisher's Description**  
  

On the world of Tyr, a kingdom controlled by a corrupt ruler sends one of
their top generals to raid the worldA's Holy Shrine, making off with the four
elemental orbs that power the gate into The Void.

Following this general and his companion are three members of a small
resistance and a mysterious knight with her own agenda. Together, they must
chase the thieves and stop them before they can return to their Kingdom, or
all hopes for the resistance are lost.

The Kingdom of Llunia is a free to download and play RPG made by myself with
