**Publisher's Description**  
  

The Elder Scrolls: Arena is a first-person computer role-playing game with
open-ended gameplay developed by Bethesda Softworks. In 2004, a downloadable
version of the game was made available free of charge as part of the 10th
anniversary of The Elder Scrolls series, but newer systems will require an
emulator such as DOSBox to run it, as Arena is a DOS-based program.
Instructions are available in the download archive for running the game on
Windows 2000/XP.

Arena takes place in the continent of Tamriel, complete with wilderness,
dungeons, and a spell creation system that allows players to mix various spell
effects into a new spell as long as they have the money to pay for it. The
Elder Scrolls: Arena offers a fully immersive environment with four hundred
cities and a multitude of dungeons to explore.

**PLEASE NOTE:** To run this game on newer systems, you will need to download an emulation program. The DOSBox emulator is located here: [DOSBox website](http://www.dosbox.sourceforge.net).
