DovadulaA's Burn is a classic freeware graphic adventure game, developed in Italian and English. 

The character can pick up, use, talk and look at objects and characters within an icons system behind the scrolling inventory on the top of the screen.

The puzzles of the game have a lot of objects, and the player can explore all the locations from the beginning of the game.

The story takes place in the imaginary town of DovadulaA's, where Punkkommando is trying to destroy the town with his bass guitar. The police stop PunkkommandoA's plan and he runs away. Punkkommando loses his bass guitar, and to escape to the policeman he assumes the identity of the crazy green man Capitan Fortuna. Then he goes to his music master Matt Freeman to find a method to definitively destroy DovadulaA's.
