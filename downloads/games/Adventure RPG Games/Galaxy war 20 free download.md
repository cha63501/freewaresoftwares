**Publisher's Description**  
  

Milky Way, 2471: Mankind already began a long time ago to venture into deep
space. By the development of the overlightspeed propulsion system they had the
possibility of establishing colonies on far distant planets and of building
space stations. Man was so able to make half of the galaxy to his home. They
also got in contact with the ApaAars, an extraterrestrial civilization that is
living together with the humans in peace.  
  
But on the 25th of October an ApaAar ship A on board also a few humans A came
across an alien race in space sector 57. Those beings, calling themselves
Qeyons, declared war on the two allied civilizations. They have the intention
of annexing the humansA and ApaAarsA resources and of enslaving them. The two
governments only received these news via hyperspace communication A the ship
never came back.  
  
You are a Lieutenant of MankindAs Space Fleet, employed on Earth. Although
still very young, Fleet Command assigns you without further ado a little ship
docked on EarthAs station A the SFS SKYLINER. You, some Fleet officers and
volunteers now have the mission to do the best to defend the human
civilization against the Qeyons.  
  
Already one week after war declaration your ship is knocked into shape,
refueled, and equipped with weapons. The ship is released from the station and
gets clearance for start. On all what you are going to do or to omit from now
not only depends your own life and your crewAs, but also the survival of the
whole human civilization...  
  
Galaxy is at war!
