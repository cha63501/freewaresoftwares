**Publisher's Description**  
  

Jesus Christ RPG deals with the period between the baptism and the
transfiguration of Jesus Christ. Like many other Role Playing Games, this one
features turn based battles. You also must undertake tasks as Jesus Christ,
Mary Magdalane, Simon Peter and Judas Iscariot.

Jesus Christ RPG was made using RPG Maker VX ACE and it will run in any
computer that can run VX ACE games, like most current versions of Windows. No
other biblical game has managed to walk the fine line between being too
reverent (but sometimes off putting) and being too zany (thus bearing no
connection to the actual gospels).

This game walks the line and maintains main events intact while adding its own
sense of humor to this story. This game is for anyone who enjoys playing role
playing video games or history or religion or any of the previous options.
