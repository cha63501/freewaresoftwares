Flyff, or A'Fly For FunA', is an online MMORPG. Flyff separates itself from most MMORPGs by having a flying system, in which you can fly around using a hoverboard or broom as a way of transportation to other islands and towns in the game to explore and level up or for battles in PVP (Player vs. Player) mode and more than 120 levels of play.
