**Publisher's Description**  
  


Valgetal has some similarities with a Russian game, but is also something completely new. It challenges you to complete basic math equations by controlling the placement of falling numbers. If you create a vertical column of three blocks, the number on top must be the sum of the two below it; if it isnA't, you are penalised by a reduction in the size of the container, which immediately makes it harder to control successive blocks precisely. 

There are 20 progressively difficult levels to begin with, in each of the four math disciplines. A high-score board lets you post your name and results. The gameA's name means A'A'falling numbersA'A' in Dutch: English, Friesian, Dutch, German and Spanish interfaces are included. Although itA's great fun, Valgetal is an addictive learning tool that educators and students should check out!
