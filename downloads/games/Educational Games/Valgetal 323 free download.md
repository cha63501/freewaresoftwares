**Publisher's Description**  
  

Valgetal has some similarities with a Russian game, but is also something
completely new. It challenges you to complete basic math equations by
controlling the placement of falling numbers. If you create a vertical column
of three blocks, the number on top must be the sum of the two below it; if it
isnA't, you are penalised by a reduction in the size of the container, which
immediately makes it harder to control successive blocks precisely.

There are 20 progressively difficult levels to begin with, in each of the four
math disciplines. A high-score board lets you post your name and results. The
gameA's name means A'A'falling numbersA'A' in Dutch: English, Friesian, Dutch,
German and Spanish interfaces are included. Although itA's great fun, Valgetal
is an addictive learning tool that educators and students should check out!
