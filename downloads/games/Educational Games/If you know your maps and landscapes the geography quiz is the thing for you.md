If you know your maps and landscapes, the Geography Quiz is the thing for you. 

The Geography Quiz invites you to test your knowledge of countries and landscapes around the world. This may be a tough one for those who are not so well-informed about the map of the world. Most of the questions revolve around locations of cities and countries, but there are some questions about population and great monuments as well. 

Each round consists of 10 questions and if you answer at least 7 of them correctly, you can proceed to the next round. The questions get more difficult as you progress from stage to stage, and to make the quiz more challenging and exciting, there is a time limit for every question. 

Even if you do not know the answer, you can click on any of the four possible answers just to try your luck. And who knows, maybe you can just manage the right one. The answers are not exactly very close to each other and if you pay more attention to them, it is possible to figure out the more possibly correct ones. 

The Geography Quiz has very interesting questions that are of valuable interest to geography enthusiasts. Join the quiz now and find out how well you know your world.
