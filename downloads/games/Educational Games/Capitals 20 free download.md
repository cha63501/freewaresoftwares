**Publisher's Description**  
  

Capitals 2.0 is a simple Windows program that helps children learn the
Capitals of the States. Capitals uses sound and visual effects to indicate
right and wrong answers. Capitals teaches by prompting the player with the
right answer upon entry of a wrong answer. The questions and answers are
randomized so the player learns the State Capitals rather than the order of
the questions. Capitals Version 2.0 now has two levels of difficulty to choose
from.
