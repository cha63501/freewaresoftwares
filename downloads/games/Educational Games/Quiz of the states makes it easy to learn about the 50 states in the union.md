**Publisher's Description**  
  


Quiz of the States makes it easy to learn about the 50 states in the Union. Includes categories on Capitols, Order and Date of Entry, and State Bird, Flower, and Tree. Generates hundreds of unique questions. No two tests are exactly the same. Load and run new quiz files from disk as they become available. QuizBuild programmable quiz generator lets you add your own data to the quiz, or create your own custom designed tests with your own spreadsheet data. 

The automatic quiz generator allows you to add more categories to the test with custom designed questions for each category. Create a test from scratch using spreadsheet data that contains multiple columns and rows. The first column must be an object (such as "State") and the additional columns are from one to ten categories. There must be only one available answer for every category in each row of data. QuizBuild will randomly select a row of "question" data and three rows of "answer" data, and will create a set of multiple choice answers. You design the question, and QuizBuild fills in the special data fields with data from the "question" data. A small database of spreadsheet data will quickly generate hundreds of original questions, test you on them, and tally the score.
