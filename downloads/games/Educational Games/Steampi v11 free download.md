**Publisher's Description**  
  

SteamPi evaluates the relationship between random numbers to estimate a value
of Pi. It can generate random numbers, or analyze a file instead. In this
mode, the selected file is read as series of integer pairs and these pairs are
used to determine an estimate for Pi. The file becomes your virtual mall. You
may notice that when you try this option the estimate for Pi will often be
quite far off. This is because most files donAt really contain random
numbers.A

There is all sorts of structure and organization, except for compressed files.
From one perspective, the whole point of compressing files is to make them
appear to be a series of random numbers. The online help includes a small
section about using this program to determine how well compressed a file is.
