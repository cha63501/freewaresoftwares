**Publisher's Description**  
  

A coloring toy for ages 3-7. Choose from four ready-to-color or randomly-
colored backgrounds, then add, position and color objects to create a unique
picture. Objects can be sized large or small, reflected, moved or deleted at
any time. A purple person dancing on a tangerine shore? Why not? Express
yourself! SeanA's Magic Slate is a freeware sample of the activities in their
shareware game I Live At SantaA's House.
