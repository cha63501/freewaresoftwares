If you know your maps and landscapes, the Geography Quiz is the thing for you.

The Geography Quiz invites you to test your knowledge of countries and
landscapes around the world. This may be a tough one for those who are not so
well-informed about the map of the world. Most of the questions revolve around
locations of cities and countries, but there are some questions about
population and great monuments as well.

Each round consists of 10 questions and if you answer at least 7 of them
correctly, you can proceed to the next round. The questions get more difficult
as you progress from stage to stage, and to make the quiz more challenging and
exciting, there is a time limit for every question.

Even if you do not know the answer, you can click on any of the four possible
answers just to try your luck. And who knows, maybe you can just manage the
right one. The answers are not exactly very close to each other and if you pay
more attention to them, it is possible to figure out the more possibly correct
ones.

The Geography Quiz has very interesting questions that are of valuable
interest to geography enthusiasts. Join the quiz now and find out how well you
know your world.
