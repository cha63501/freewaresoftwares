**Publisher's Description**  
  


Want to brush up on the names and locations of the 50 or so countries of modern Africa? This program from the Family Games Web Center will help you. African Geography Tutor presents a scrolling map of Africa along with a list of countries. As your mouse pointer passes over the map, the country under the pointer highlights, along with its entry in the list. Simply browse the map until you feel ready, then try either of the two self-test modes. In Find Countries mode, you are asked to click a country on the map given its name. In Identify Countries mode, you are asked to click the name in the list corresponding to the country that is highlighted on the map. Both quizzes run through the entire list of 49 countries in random order. A running score is displayed. Any errors are highlighted in the country list for later review.
