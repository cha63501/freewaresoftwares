Fancy a History Quiz? How much do you know about history? Find out in this fun
History Quiz.

Answer 10 multiple choice questions on history. If you get 70% correct you
progress to the next level. The questions are kind of tough for people who are
weak in history. They involve names, numbers, dates and events. However, the
bank of questions is the same so if you take the quiz again, you will see that
many of the questions are repeated.

After a few rounds, you will know that the first atomic bomb was dropped in
1945, 13 people took part in the Last Supper and the first pair of sunglasses
was invented in China. The questions cover a wide scope of facts and figures
so if you take the quiz often, your knowledge on the history of the world will
improve significantly.

For the serious history buff, this quiz may serve as a breezy refresher. Who
was the first woman to win the Noble Prize? Do you want to know? Take the quiz
to find out. You will be surprised, bemused and informed.
