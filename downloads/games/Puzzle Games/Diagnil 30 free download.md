**Publisher's Description**  
  

Diagnil supports the process of solving diagramless crossword puzzles where
the clues are obtained from external sources, such as those distributed in
print form.

The diagramless puzzle is a crossword variant where only word clues are
provided; word locations are not disclosed. Solving the puzzle requires
determining not only the words but also their correct placement on the grid.

Although not suitable for beginners, diagramless puzzles are easier than often
presumed. The solving process, however, can be tedious, especially when
working on paper. Diagnil is a tool designed to remove the tedium and make
diagramless solving practical and enjoyable for most crossword enthusiasts.

Use Diagnil by entering words, placing them on a grid, and making adjustments
until the final shape is achieved. All you need to begin are lists of word
clues obtained from books, newspapers or other sources. Puzzles as large as
those published in Sunday newspapers (typically 21 by 21) are accommodated
easily.
