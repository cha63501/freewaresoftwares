Amazing Squares is a version of the classic "falling blocks" game. The game boosts two different playmodes. Standard and psycho. In psycho mode the blocks will be "alive" and move around the screen by them selves, giving you a real challenge. 

Other features include the ability to save blocks for later, and skin support. The game also contains beautiful CGI rendered graphics and excellent music.
