**Publisher's Description**  
  


Mallet Mania is a game of logic and skill. The interface has been designed to resemble the popular Windows game Minesweeper, but the game itself is a brand-new concept. 

The aim of the game is to flatten every grey square on the grid as fast as possible - the numbers tell you how many times each square needs to be hit before itA's flattened. The problem is that the mallet you use to hit them with isnA't a very precise instrument, and it will hit 4 squares (in a 2x2 block) at the same time. WhatA's more, hitting areas that are already flat would cause a dent and is not allowed, so completing the grid isnA't as easy as it looks... 

This game needs a quick eye and a fair amount of thought to win, but when youA've got the knack, you can upload your best times to see how you rank against other players around the world!
