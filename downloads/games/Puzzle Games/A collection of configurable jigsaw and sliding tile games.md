Virtual Toybox Puzzle Games is a collection of configurable jigsaw and tile puzzle games. 

Newly updated with stunning nature photos, and several game configuration options, you will find hours of entertainment in these puzzles.

This collection features a jigsaw puzzle with square or hex shaped pieces, a deceptively simple spinning tile game that is very difficult to solve, and the well-known sliding tile puzzle.

As with all Virtual Toybox software, the puzzle games collection will run on any system (Windows, Linux, or Mac) with a current [Java installation](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp).
