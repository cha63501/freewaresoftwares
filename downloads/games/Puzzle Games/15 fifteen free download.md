**Publisher's Description**  
  

15 (Fifteen) is a sequential movement puzzle made up of 15 consecutively
numbered sliding blocks, all placed in a square tray large enough to hold 16
blocks. After the pieces are scrambled, the solver has to restore the blocks
to the original order. You may make the game easier by lowering the number of
blocks to 8 (3X3) or make the game more challenging by increasing the number
of blocks to 24 (5X5). You may also insert a picture into the puzzle. This
sliding-piece puzzle is a real challenge, so put your brain to work and prove
how smart you really are.
