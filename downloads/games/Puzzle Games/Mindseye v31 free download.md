**Publisher's Description**  
  

MindsEye is a Mastermind style game that requires concentration and deductive
reasoning. The object of the game is to guess, in the correct order, the
colors that the computer has selected.

The computer will randomly select four colors. There are 7 colors for the
beginner game, 11 colors for the intermediate game, and 15 colors for the
advanced game. The computer will not choose the same color more than once per
game. You click the colors you desire and then click the boxes where you think
those colors belong.

The computer will then give you hints on the numbers that you have right. In
the Correct column will be the number of colors that you have right and in the
right place. In the Out Of Place column will be the number of colors that you
have right but in the wrong place. If you have all four colors right in the
right place, you win. If not, try another guess. Continue these steps until
either you win (all four colors correct) or you lose by not getting all four
colors correct in ten guesses.
