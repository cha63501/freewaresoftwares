Cudoku can be used as a virtual board for solving Sudoku puzzles generated by
program, or entered by user. Puzzles can be printed or saved in vector file
format (ready to paste in any document etc). Each puzzle in fact is solved by
the user. Program only (especially in highest hint level) tells where to
click.
