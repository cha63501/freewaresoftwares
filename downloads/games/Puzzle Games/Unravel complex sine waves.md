**Publisher's Description**  
  


Play Period is a brain teasing sort of puzzle where you try to determine the set of simple sine waves responsible for creating a complex composite wave. The important thing to point out is that this guessing game turns out to be more fun and intriguing than you (or I) would expect it to be.
