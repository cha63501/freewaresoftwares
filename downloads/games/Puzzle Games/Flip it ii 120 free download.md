**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this game there will be a grid of pegs and you need to flip the pegs so
that the white side faces up. When you flip a peg, the adjacent pegs will also
be flipped, so you need to plan which pegs to flip. There are a total of 7
levels and the game will be harder and harder. The faster and the fewer moves
you need to finish a level, the higher your score.

**Requires:** [Adobe AIR](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Adobe-AIR_program_42448.html).
