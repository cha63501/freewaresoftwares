**Publisher's Description**  
  

frozen@mid80 is a program, for demonstrating a 1970s (upto the mid-1980) style
of visual-programming, that was well-known in academic circles, but never
finding popularity in programming, nor in the puzzle world.

Listing a few (fix set of) macros -- with the flexibility of choosing how to
link them. Good base for educating your intuition (for children, too) -- and
with story examples, reflecting what a formal-net could represent.

The page http://www.mid80.net/mid80.htm describes the software -- including
the program manual.

**Requires:** MSDOS (if state-saving wanted; if not, BIOS)
