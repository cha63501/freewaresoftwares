**Publisher's Description**  
  


In this game there will be a grid of pegs and you need to flip the pegs so that the white side faces up. When you flip a peg, the adjacent pegs will also be flipped, so you need to plan which pegs to flip. There are a total of 7 levels and the game will be harder and harder. The faster and the fewer moves you need to finish a level, the higher your score. 

**Requires:** [Adobe AIR](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Adobe-AIR_program_42448.html).
