**Publisher's Description**  
  

This game is similar to Sudoku except that there are extra hints given by the
ordinal relationship between the numbers in the blocks. In this game there
will be a grid of 9 x 9 squares, the grid will further be divided into 9
subgroups of 3 x 3 squares each. Between two blocks in a subgroup, there will
be a greater than or less than sign indicating the order of the numbers in the
squares.

The object of this game is to fill in all the squares with numbers 1 - 9 where
the numbers in each row or column or subgroup must not repeat, and that the
numbers must obey the relationship given by the signs. The faster you finish
this game, the higher your score. If you are stuck, you can click the hint
button to get some hint, but a time penality will be applied.
