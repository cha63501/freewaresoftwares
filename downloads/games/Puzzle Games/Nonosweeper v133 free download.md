**Publisher's Description**  
  

Nonosweeper is a cross between the popular Windows game Minesweeper and the
hidden-pictures logic puzzles known as Nonograms or Griddlers. Unlike
Minesweeper, all the clues are given at the start and placed outside the grid,
giving completely different gameplay - but the other rules are the same, so
donA't click on a mine or itA's Game Over! You can upload your record times to
an on-line database to see how you rank. An exciting new challenge for
Minesweeper fans and Nonogram fans alike.
