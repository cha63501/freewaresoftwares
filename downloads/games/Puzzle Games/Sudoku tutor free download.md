**Publisher's Description**  
  

SuDoku has been a craze since 2005 and nearly each newspaper is publishing
daily SuDoku puzzles. But a large number of people, though interested, have
not yet solved their first SuDoku... reason being no guidance received.

The SuDoku Solvers available on net are mostly based on backtracking method
which a human being is not capable of following, and the steps taken for
solution are not shown by such solvers.

SuDoku Tutor 3i is a software that runs on Internet Explorer 5 and above and
is capable of showing step by step solution of a user-given SuDoku Puzzle.
This software also supports Jigsaw SuDoku puzzles.
