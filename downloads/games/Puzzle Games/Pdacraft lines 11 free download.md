Lines is a very popular, simple and easy-to-play puzzle game.

Each turn, three randomly colored balls appears on the board. You can move
ball if there is a path (linked set of vertical and horizontal empty cells)
between the current position of the ball and the desired position. You must
move one of balls to pick the line of 5 or more balls of the same color. When
such line is arranged it disappears.

You can make vertical, horizontal or diagonal lines. Lines, which are longer
than 5 balls, will be awarded by extra score points. The game is over, when
the entire board is filled with balls.
