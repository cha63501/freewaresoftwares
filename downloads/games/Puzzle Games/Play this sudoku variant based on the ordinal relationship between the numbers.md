**Publisher's Description**  
  


This game is similar to Sudoku except that there are extra hints given by the ordinal relationship between the numbers in the blocks. In this game there will be a grid of 9 x 9 squares, the grid will further be divided into 9 subgroups of 3 x 3 squares each. Between two blocks in a subgroup, there will be a greater than or less than sign indicating the order of the numbers in the squares. 

The object of this game is to fill in all the squares with numbers 1 - 9 where the numbers in each row or column or subgroup must not repeat, and that the numbers must obey the relationship given by the signs. The faster you finish this game, the higher your score. If you are stuck, you can click the hint button to get some hint, but a time penality will be applied. 

**Requires:** [Adobe AIR](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Adobe-AIR_program_42448.html).
