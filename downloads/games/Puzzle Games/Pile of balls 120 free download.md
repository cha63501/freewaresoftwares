**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this game there will be an area where you drop balls to pile them up. Each
time 3 balls will be given and you can rotate or move them before dropping
them to the group to pile them up. When 4 or more balls of the same colour are
connected, the balls will be destroyed. When the balls become unstable, they
will roll down, making the positions of the balls difficult to predict and the
game is more challenging.

**Requires:** [Adobe AIR](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Adobe-AIR_program_42448.html).
