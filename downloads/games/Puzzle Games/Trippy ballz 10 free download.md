**Publisher's Description**  
  

Trippy Ballz is a wacky freeware bat-and-ball style arcade game created in a
proud tradition resonant of several truly classic arcade and console games
throughout the history of video gaming.

Trippy Ballz however, is never the same game twice and you never know for sure
what will happen next: from flying purple dolphins to robot kitties to little
blue pills that make things grow bigger... Jeez!

This game comes screaming at you from the oddball mind of Chris OA'Connell,
created with The Games Factory 2 by Clickteam.
