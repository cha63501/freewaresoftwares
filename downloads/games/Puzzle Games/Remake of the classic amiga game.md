**Publisher's Description**  
  


Atomic was an Amiga game released by Thalion in 1990. The goal of the puzzle is to assemble a molecule by moving its constituent atoms around. 

The trouble is that once moved, the atoms will continue moving until they hit an obstacle (such as a block or another atom).

This version features the original graphics. It can be played using either the mouse or the keyboard.
