**Publisher's Description**  
  


Amazeing is a realistic 3D maze walkthrough game - can you find the exit? Or will you be slimed by the evil mucus? 

Choose an small easy maze until you get used to the game, or boggle your brain with the huge 50x50 room single level challenge. Do you have what it takes to make it through the synpase charring 25x25x25 room 3D labyrinth? 

Amazeing has a huge range of fully configurable options, so you can customise the look and game play to suit your mood and skill. Set the color scheme to one of the nine preset ones, or use your own. Turn on colour cycling and watch the waves of colour flow beneath your feet. A choice of viewpoints means you can choose the one that you understand the easiest, and you can even use your own messages on the walls! 

There are a variety of things to make it easier. The hint feature gives you precise directions on which way you should be going. The distance indicator tells you just how far you are from the exit, so you can tell if you are getting closer or further away. The compass lets you know the direction you are facing, and the mud map automatically keeps track of where youA've been. 

Of course, there are also things to make the game harder. Watch out for the MUCUS (ewwww!!!), a big glob of mucus that can chase you through the maze. DonA't get slimed now! Even the mucus is configurable - make it stupid or smart, and use the radar screen to avoid it. 

The random transportation factor lets you set the probability of suddenly being transported somewhere else in the maze. Think youA've got the maze figured out? Think again! AmazeingA's automatic maze generator means every maze is different, every time. 

Handsome pastel colors, cartoon sound effects and an original midi music score will entertain you for hours as you wrestle with this brain teaser. 

Other than needing Windows 95, 98, 2000/2003, NT4 or XP, Amazeing has no special requirements. It will even run in 640x480x16 colours, although 800x600x256 is the recommended minimum.
