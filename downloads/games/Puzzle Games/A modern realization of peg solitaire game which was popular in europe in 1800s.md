**Publisher's Description**  
  


The game known as "Peg Solitaire" was popular throughout Europe in the 1800s. It is said the game was invented by a prisoner in the Bastille. FreePeg is a modern improved version of this game. 

FreePeg has two types of levels: puzzle levels (like in the original Peg Solitaire) and strategy levels.

The goal of the puzzle levels is to remove all the pegs but one. The goal of the strategy levels is to remove as many pegs as you can.
