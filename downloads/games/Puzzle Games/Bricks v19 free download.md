**Publisher's Description**  
  

BRICKS is a remake of the Polish A'KlockiA' game. The original game was a
small wooden board that could be arranged into several puzzles. The goal of
the game is to move the red master brick to a certain position. Sounds easy
but it is a real brain teaser since you get more points if you need less
moves.

BRICKS was inspired by the Microsoft A'KlotskiA' game. Levels 1 to 24 are
adopted from this game (with minor changes) while Levels 25 to 48 feature new
elements making BRICKS more attractive and difficult.
