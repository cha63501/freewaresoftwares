**Publisher's Description**  
  

This nifty little freeware program plays the game chomp against you. You have
to avoid finishing a rectangular chocolate bar as you take turns to eat
rectangular bites from the bottom right hand corner. There is nothing to
install (or uninstall), just run the exe. There are different difficulty
settings and you can set how long the computer is allowed to think for, how
big the initial bar is, whether sound is played and a few more options.
