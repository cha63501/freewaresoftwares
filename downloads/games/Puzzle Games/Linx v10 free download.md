Linx is an unique logical game. You are presented with an operating field
divided into 168 tiles - fourteen squares in a row and twelve per column! On
the playfield you will find Bases occupying these tiles. Your objective is to
connect the bases of the same color using the paths of the same color. The
paths can only be connected to themselves orthogonally, one path per tile, and
the different colors canA't cross! Despite of its simplicity, this game will
test your mind as well as patience, and bring you a lot of fun for many hours!

And then finally, there is a built-in editor, which allows you to create your
own devious levels! AND to make it EVEN BETTER, you can share your creations
with people thorough the whole world, by registering on the authorsA' site,
and uploading levels to the on-line database! Of course you can also download
the levels created by others, which will bring you even more fun and will make
the game last for a lot more!
