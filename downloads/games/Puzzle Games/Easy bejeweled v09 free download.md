Play free Easy Bejeweled! No limitations. No Charges.

The rectangular area of play starts filled with colored gemss. The only valid
move is to swap adjacent gems to make three or more gems of the same color
line up horizontally or vertically. When that happens, the player earns
points, the lined-up gems disappear, the gems above them fall and the extra
space is filled with random gems. Once this has happened, there may once again
be three or more gems lined up, in which case the process is repeated. This is
called a "cascade". The game ends when there are no valid moves.
