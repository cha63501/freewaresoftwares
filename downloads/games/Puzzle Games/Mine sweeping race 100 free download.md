**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this game you need to race against each other for the fastest mine sweeper.
The play area is composed of a grid of blocks, the one who opens all the
blocks first wins. When you open a block, the number of mines adjacent to that
block will be shown, and you can use this information to figure out where the
mines are and open the blocks without mines. If you open a block with a mine,
then you will be penalized for 10 seconds. When you concluded that a block has
a mine, right click or press the space bar to put down a flag on a block to
remind yourself that the block has a mine.

**Requires:** [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer/).
