**Publisher's Description**  
  


Grab your sword and start chopping your way to the bottom of a vast dungeon! Learning how to play is simple--you move Beethro in one of eight directions or rotate his sword clockwise or counter-clockwise. Examine a detailed overhead view of an underground room, and plan BeethroA's movements with care, always keeping his sword between him and the critters. You can wait as long as you like before moving, and logical problem-solving is paramount, but the game still has a sense of action as you lay waste to hordes of nasties. 

Each room of the dungeon is a handcrafted challenge for you to complete, with chambers and corridors purposefully designed to befuddle. In DROD you will find numerous game elements, some of which I can guarantee youA've never seen in any other game. There is a huge amount of exploration in wait for you, but if you should complete DuganA's Dungeon or would simply like a break from it, you can also try your hand at architecting your own dungeons with the new level editor. 

DROD has been praised by many for its originality, and has enjoyed a growing cult following since 1997. If youA've never played the game, well... you just have to! If youA've already seen it, check out the latest incarnation of this classic puzzler. This is a from-scratch rewrite of the original with years of work put into it by several developers.
