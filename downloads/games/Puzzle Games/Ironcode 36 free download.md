Crack the code! The code is a 3, 4, 5, or 6-digit number (you choose) with no
repeating digits.

You must guess the code using feedback provided from each guess entered. Crack
the code with a low enough score and earn a rank on the local highscore
boards.

A number of optional widgets are available to enhance and customize gameplay,
including a note pad and an on-screen keypad. The game has many options to
modify the gameplay and create harder challenges.

IronCode is a must-have for the serious logic-puzzle fan.
