NiMuSi Puzznic is a remake of the classic puzzle game.

It is a puzzle in which the player pushes the pieces around a maze, trying to
get matching pieces together. Any matching pieces are eliminated, and you need
to eliminate them all to win.

The drawback is that there are immovable blocks which hinder your movement.
You can only move the pieces horizontally, the effects of gravity make them
drop.

There are moving platforms which you can use to help you move the pieces
around the level.

The game area is viewed from above. The game is very simple, mentally
challenging and requires logic to complete it.

This version is a faithfull implementation of the original, consisting of 159
puzzles. The difficulty level increases as you progress through the puzzles.
