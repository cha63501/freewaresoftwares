**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this game there will be lines of balls with numbers on them. You can shoot
balls to add new balls to the line. When the balls you shoot and the balls
beside it add up to 10, these balls will be destroyed. You can also destroy a
group of same numbered balls with only one ball. When you destroy all the
balls you can proceed to the next level. If the balls reach the hole, then you
lose the game. Occasionally there will be coins that appear on the screen, you
can shoot the coins to get the colours of the balls sorted for a while, it
will be a lot easier. Use the mouse to control the direction of the shots and
click to shoot. You can also press the space bar to swap between the ball to
shoot and the next ball to shoot.
