**Publisher's Description**  
  

Remember the good old Nibbles game with the apple eating worm/snake?, Well,
This is a pretty good and funny clone. You play "Deep Blue", a former gang
leader as you go on an adventure in The Bad Lands. You will encounter traps,
teleporters and one way scrollers.

The Game Includes:

  * 7 Types Of Food To Be Taken 
  * 6 Types Of Regular Tiles 
  * Walls, Traps, Teleporters And Scrollers 
  * Digitized Sound Effects And Music 
  * Level Editor! (Yep, Get Creative) 
  * A Lot More Information Is In The Game. 
The Big Apple is another early game of mine which is a clone of the popular
Nibbles game, it features 3 levels of difficulty spanning 20 levels as well as
a level editor and run on Windows systems.
