**Publisher's Description**  
  

Oktagon comprises two separate octagonal puzzles. In the first, you must
rearrange a set of four to eight irregular shapes to form an octagon. In the
second puzzle, you must rotate six concentric octagonal rings until all have
the same orientation. The catch is that the rings are linked, so that rotating
one also rotates one or two others.
