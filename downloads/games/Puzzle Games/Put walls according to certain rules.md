**Publisher's Description**  
  


In this game there will be a grid of spaces and some numbered pillars at the corners of the spaces. Your job is to fill up all the spaces with diagonal walls. The number of walls connecting to a pillar must match the number written on the pillar; and the walls must not form a closed loop. Recognizing certain patterns of the pillars can help you finish the game faster. The faster you finish the game, the higher the score you have.
