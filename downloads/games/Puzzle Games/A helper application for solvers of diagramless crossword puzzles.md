**Publisher's Description**  
  


Diagnil supports the process of solving diagramless crossword puzzles where the clues are obtained from external sources, such as those distributed in print form. 

The diagramless puzzle is a crossword variant where only word clues are provided; word locations are not disclosed. Solving the puzzle requires determining not only the words but also their correct placement on the grid.

Although not suitable for beginners, diagramless puzzles are easier than often presumed. The solving process, however, can be tedious, especially when working on paper. Diagnil is a tool designed to remove the tedium and make diagramless solving practical and enjoyable for most crossword enthusiasts.

Use Diagnil by entering words, placing them on a grid, and making adjustments until the final shape is achieved. All you need to begin are lists of word clues obtained from books, newspapers or other sources. Puzzles as large as those published in Sunday newspapers (typically 21 by 21) are accommodated easily.
