**Publisher's Description**  
  

Sensitive is a remake of a fun little puzzle game on the C64. The original was
made by Oliver Kirwa. There are 60 levels in this game, some of them almost
too easy, others might make you want to never play the game again. That
feeling will probably not last so long, as Sensitive is highly addictive.
