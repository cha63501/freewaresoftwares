**Publisher's Description**  
  


3 paper games. Each game has 4 levels of difficulty. Tic-tac-toe is played on a 4x4 game board. Cram will remind you of Tic-tac-toe but played on a 8x8 game field. 

In the game Super Nim there are randomly placed pieces on the board when the game begins. The players in turn remove all of the pieces from one selected column or row. If you are the player to remove the very last piece, you win!
