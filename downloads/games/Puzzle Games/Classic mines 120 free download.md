**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this game there will be a grid of covered blocks. There may be mines in
some of the blocks. The purpose of this game is to open all the blocks without
opening a mine. When you open a block, a number will be shown telling you how
many mines are adjacent to the block, and you can use this information to
figure out which block has a mine and which block doesnA't. Right click (or
press the spacebar) to put a flag on a block when you think that a block has a
mine. The faster you finish, the higher the score you have.
