**Publisher's Description**  
  


Daves Trails is a SIMPLE little puzzle game written for Windows. Nothing fancy, but Excellent if you are the puzzle solving type. You basically just have to put colored tiles together to complete a trail on a 7 X 7 tile grid. (It IS NOT a slider puzzle) 

It looks simple, is very easy to learn, but it will slowly addict you if you are the puzzle solving type of person.

It was optimized for WinXP 1024 X 768 display but should work as low as 800 X 600.

It is window scalable so you can leave it running on your desktop while you do other things. You can even let it running Minimized. As with all of our software, it only uses a very small draw on your CPU as compared to most other software.

It also has four Save locations so that 4 people can try and solve the puzzles on the same computer. 

This is the Web version of Daves Trails due to upload limitations. All 47 levels will still work fine, but the background resolutions are lowered. Also some of the music files were deleted so you will notice songs repeating (If, of course, you even want the music on in the 1st place) Download and give it a try. You have nothing to lose but a little time.

Because of many requests, we added a counter which will keep track of how long it takes you to solve the 47 levels of puzzles. If you find Daves Trails a little too hard then try A'Jills TrailsA'.
