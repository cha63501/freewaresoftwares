In this game there are some seesaws and some objects placed on the seesaws. When two objects are placed on the two sides of a seesaw, you can tell which one is heavier by the direction of inclination of the seesaws. 

There will be more than one seesaw so you need to make multiple comparisons in order to find out the heaviest item. There are a total of 20 levels.
