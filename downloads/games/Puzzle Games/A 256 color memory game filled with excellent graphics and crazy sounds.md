**Publisher's Description**  
  


Forgotten Cards is the first of Brain Dead SoftwareA's games. It is a 256 color memory game filled with excellent graphics and crazy sounds. 

Forgotten Cards is the very first game IA've ever made, it is a card memory game where each player takes turns trying to match two similar cards, it is a DOS game but surprisingly works very well under my Windows XP and of course in DosBox. 

It was created in QuickBasic 4.5 back in the good old days of DOS, IA've teamed up with a friend and classmate, Ilan Langer, who studied architecture with me in high school and who have created the funny artwork and silly sounds for the game. 

In the good old days, VGA, mouse support, and screen effects like fade to black were not taken for granted, each of these components had to be programmed and I remember being very proud that IA've been able to implement these aspects for the game.
