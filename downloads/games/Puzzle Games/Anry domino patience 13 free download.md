**Publisher's Description**  
  

Anry Domino Patience is a free game of logic using dominos where you match up
domino "cells" (half the full domino), either horizontally or vertically, to
match all 28 domino pieces.

It features a master layout showing completed domino cell pairs, each game has
at least one solution, the game field has a few nice looks, no setup required
(just download & play), and more.

This game looks so easy but is really quite hard. The concept of game is
simple, just select adjoining cells (horizontally or vertically) and the
appropriate pair will be displayed in the master list on the left. Once you
have matched all 28 domino "pairs" you have won. However, it is never as
simple as that...

Click to enlargeIt is a game of logic that stretches the gray matter as you
select, and deselect, domino pairs until you have matched them all. May be it
will keep you amused, and/or frustrated, for many, many hours.
