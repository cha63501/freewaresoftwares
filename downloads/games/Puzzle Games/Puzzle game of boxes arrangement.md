**Publisher's Description**  
  


BoxWorld is a puzzle game, where the player have to place boxes over special places in order to gain energy to teleport to the next level. 

If the player gets stuck by placing boxes in inappropriate places, he can retry the current stage, by pressing the R key, but this will cost a life. If all the lives are exhausted - the game is over. The boxes can be only pushed, but not pulled, thus requiring ordering of the boxes with caution. 

The game features nice graphics, enjoyable music and 525 mindboggling levels for completion. Because the stages are so many and hard to be completed in a single session, the progress can be saved with the press of the S key on the keyboard, which later can be loaded with the L key. The Space key teleports to the next puzzle, but only if the current puzzle was already completed in previous game. There is no chronometer for the level, so the player can relax and think on the level, before pushing, without the pressure of external factors, except the world itself. 

With the progress of the game, the puzzles are getting harder and harder. The player have to come up with more complex strategies on the later levels, with much more pushes and special tricks in order to place the boxes in corners or long corridors. Sometime most of the boxes are already placed in the appropriate area, but the player have to replace all the boxes just to be able to move another box and arrange it where it belongs.

Does not require installation. Simply unzip the archive and run the executable file.
