JillA's Trails is actually the predecessor of Daves Trails. 

It has 50 levels of puzzle solving fun. Can YOU get to the end?

JillA's Trails is a puzzle game. No scrolling, no learning curve, no arcade action, just a puzzle that you have to solve. If you see two of the same color squares on the grid, just connect them with the same color... simple.

Or is it?
