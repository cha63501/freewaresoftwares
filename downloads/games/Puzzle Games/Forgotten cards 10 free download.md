**Publisher's Description**  
  

Forgotten Cards is the first of Brain Dead SoftwareA's games. It is a 256
color memory game filled with excellent graphics and crazy sounds.

Forgotten Cards is the very first game IA've ever made, it is a card memory
game where each player takes turns trying to match two similar cards, it is a
DOS game but surprisingly works very well under my Windows XP and of course in
DosBox.

It was created in QuickBasic 4.5 back in the good old days of DOS, IA've
teamed up with a friend and classmate, Ilan Langer, who studied architecture
with me in high school and who have created the funny artwork and silly sounds
for the game.

In the good old days, VGA, mouse support, and screen effects like fade to
black were not taken for granted, each of these components had to be
programmed and I remember being very proud that IA've been able to implement
these aspects for the game.
