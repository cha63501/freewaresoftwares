**Publisher's Description**  
  


In this game there will be a 10 x 10 area. You need to put leprechauns in the area to turn the entire area green. When you put a leprechaun, it will turn all the blocks it can see green. A leprechaun can see all the blocks on the same row or column but it cannot see through the shamrocks. Some shamrocks have numbers on them and you need to put the exact number of leprechauns beside those shamrocks. If there are no numbers on the shamrocks, then you can put any number of leprechaunA's beside them. Another rule is that two leprechauns must not see each other. The faster you finish the game, the higher your score.
