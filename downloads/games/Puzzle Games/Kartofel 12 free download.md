**Publisher's Description**  
  

A game of skill and logic. The objective is to connect the numbered dots in
order, i.e., you start from the dot number 1, from there you have to draw the
line to number 2, then number 3, etc.

The difficulty comes from the requirement that you cannot cross over any line
already drawn. Thus the challenge is to find the optimal path. The game has an
arcade element, since the line is drawn by a moving point, which is controlled
using the keyboard, and the faster it moves the more points you score.

The best players are listed on the [Kartofel Hall of
Fame](http://kartofel.jfedor.org/hall-of-fame.php) page.
