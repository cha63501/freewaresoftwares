**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this game there will be a 10 x 10 area. You need to put leprechauns in the
area to turn the entire area green. When you put a leprechaun, it will turn
all the blocks it can see green. A leprechaun can see all the blocks on the
same row or column but it cannot see through the shamrocks. Some shamrocks
have numbers on them and you need to put the exact number of leprechauns
beside those shamrocks. If there are no numbers on the shamrocks, then you can
put any number of leprechaunA's beside them. Another rule is that two
leprechauns must not see each other. The faster you finish the game, the
higher your score.
