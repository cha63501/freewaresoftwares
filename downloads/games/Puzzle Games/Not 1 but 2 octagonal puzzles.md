**Publisher's Description**  
  


Oktagon comprises two separate octagonal puzzles. In the first, you must rearrange a set of four to eight irregular shapes to form an octagon. In the second puzzle, you must rotate six concentric octagonal rings until all have the same orientation. The catch is that the rings are linked, so that rotating one also rotates one or two others.
