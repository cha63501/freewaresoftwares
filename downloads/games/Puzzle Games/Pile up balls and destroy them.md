**Publisher's Description**  
  


In this game there will be an area where you drop balls to pile them up. Each time 3 balls will be given and you can rotate or move them before dropping them to the group to pile them up. When 4 or more balls of the same colour are connected, the balls will be destroyed. When the balls become unstable, they will roll down, making the positions of the balls difficult to predict and the game is more challenging. 

**Requires:** [Adobe AIR](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Adobe-AIR_program_42448.html).
