This game is the same as sudoku, except that the small groups are in an
irregular shape. The object of this game is to fill in all the squares with
numbers 1 to 9, the numbers in a row or a column must not repeat, and also the
numbers in a group must not repeat. The faster you finish the game, the higher
your score. When you are stuck, you can use the hints, but you will be
penalized.
