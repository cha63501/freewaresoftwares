**Publisher's Description**  
  

Neuronics is a puzzle game. It is adapted from an Amiga game which appeared in
the 90s, written by Thalion.

The concept of Neuronic is very simple, but mastering it can be very difficult
especially at the higher levels. You have a set of tiles with various symbols.
The aim of the game is to remove all these tiles. This is done by swapping
adjacent tiles so that matching symbols come together. All such matching
symbols are destroyed.

There are 103 levels available in this version of Neuronics. A fixed amount of
time is allowed for each puzzle, this is constantly updated on the screen. The
levels get progressively more difficult as you progress through them.

A graphical level selector allows you to preview a level before you play it.
The game also features sound effects (which can be turned off). The speed of
the game can be adjusted to one of three preset rates.

Mistakes can be easily rectified as you can undo moves back to the start of
the level. You can also restart a level at the click of a button.

The game can be paused at any time and there is also a demo mode.

Requires DirectX 9.
