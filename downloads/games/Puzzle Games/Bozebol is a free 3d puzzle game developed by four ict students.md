In Beasts3D you play a beekeeper whose bees are mutated to gigantic killer-bees. The bees are now so big, the only way to catch them is to surrounding them with blocks from 4 sides, so it cannot move anymore. When all the bees are caugth, the level is won. Doing this, the bees will try to sting you. If they succeed, you lose a life. 

Higher levels will contain more and faster monsters, less blocks, more powerups and they will be bigger. Scores are kept both online and on your local pc. This way, you can compete other Beasts3D players. The game will only put scores online when there is an open internet connection. It will never try to connect to the internet.
