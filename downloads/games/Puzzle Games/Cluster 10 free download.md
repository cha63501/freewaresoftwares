**Publisher's Description**  
  

Cluster is a freeware puzzle game IA've written. In this game you drive a
bulldozer and your job is to push blocks around so that they all touch each
other.

Sounds easy, but there is a catch. Once blocks touch, they fuse together,
making them tougher to move around the oddly shaped rooms. Cluster comes with
50 challenging levels, and a level editor, for you to make and share your own
levels.
