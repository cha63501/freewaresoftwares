**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this game you will need to play darts with 501 points. The dartboard is
divided into 20 areas with scores of 1 to 20, each area is further divided
into 4 regions, the larger 2 regions score the same as the score for the area,
the outer thin region scores 2 times as the area score, and the inner thin
region scores 3 times as the area score. The bullseye (the red dot at the
center) scores 50 points, the bullA's ring (the green ring around the center)
scores 25 points.

In each turn you throw 3 darts, each time you throw a dart, the score you get
from the dart will be deducted from the initial point of 501, the object of
the game is to deduct the points to exactly zero. Try to use the minimum
number of darts to finish 501 points.
