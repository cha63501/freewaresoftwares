In this game there will be a pool table with 10 randomly placed red balls.
First you need to decide the position of the white ball, then you need to hit
the white ball with the cue and let the white ball hit the red balls into the
pockets.

You score higher when you can pop in red balls for consecutive cues. Use the
mouse to control the direction and speed of the white ball.
