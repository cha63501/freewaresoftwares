**Publisher's Description**  
  

Cosmic Pool is a new, science-fiction take on traditional pool: taking place
inside of a three dimesional game cube, the balls are suspended in zero-
gravity. The object is similar to that of ordinary pool- to knock all of your
balls out of play, and then the eight ball using only your cue ball. But
having to line up shots in three dimensional space changes the strategic
complexion of the game dramatically.

**Features:**

  * instant replay of the last shot taken 
  * slow-motion display mode 
  * a ball trajectory plotter 
  * lower "resolution" graphics modes for slower computers.
