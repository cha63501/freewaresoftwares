In this game, you need to shoot free kicks. First, you need to set the angle of the shot, then you need to set the elevation, and then you need to set the curvature, and finally you set the force of the shot. You need to set all these carefully so that you can bend the ball to shoot through the man wall and into the goal. There are a total of 10 shots and the shots will be more and more difficult.
