**Publisher's Description**  
  


Arguably more than any other sport, golf requires focus and mental stamina, and so does Shot-Online, which is a reproduction of the full experience and game of golf in full, rich 3D graphics. 

Shot-Online is not just an online sports game either, but it is a highly accurate simulation and a deep role-playing experience. It is the RPG quality that makes Shot-Online the unique game it is, especially with the community interaction and the enhancement and leveling of your character. 

Speaking of community and role-playing, Shot-Online offers both realistic and rare items drawn from the celebrated history of golf. Practicing every day, competing against players with different skills, allows the gamer to advance their characters abilities. Quests and item exchanging and more add to the community feel. 

A proprietary physics engine was used in Shot-Online to accurately recreate the ball and course dynamics. In other words, the ball will behave as it should over the geography of the course. Characters also benefit from accuracy through technology. Motion captured golf swings from a PGA golfer were used to match the most spot-on feel of a real golf swing, putting, chip shot, and other golfing actions. 

As a gallery, watching a game played on Shot-Online is like seeing a professional golf sportscast on television, with the overall presentation, the numerous camera angles and the gallery mode. Whether youA're watching or playing, Shot-Online golf is designed to both play and look as close to reality as possible. Shot-Online is more than a sports game, more than a simulation, more than an RPG ? like golf itself, it is an intelligent and unique game that is more than the sum of its parts.
