PC gamers now have the opportunity to enjoy the popular multiplayer game, Shadowgun: DeadZone. Madfinger Games launched a Facebook app and downloadable version of the game on July 31, 2013, which makes it truly multi-platform. The game was originally launched towards the end of 2011 for Android and iOS devices, and a number of improvements have been made since then. 

**Shadowgun: DeadZone Features**

  * Intense tactical multiplayer combat with up to 12 players 
  * Two popular game modes: Deathmatch and Zone Control 
  * Various maps and a selection of 10 playable characters 
  * A wide ranging arsenal of 21 weapons all of which are upgradable 
  * Various items including Medi Kit, Ammo Kit, Flash Grenades, EMP Grenades, Frag Grenades, Sentry Guns and Mines 
  * Daily challenges and rewards 
  * Multilanguage localization (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese) 
  * Talk to your friends in real time with multiplayer voice chat 

**Playing Shadowgun: DeadZone on PC**

We downloaded the installer program and ran it on our PC. The game gave us the option to log in using an existing account or create a new one. We liked the fact that we could use the same account across all platforms, which meant we had access to our bought items, money, gold and ranks irrespective of the device we used.

If you have a Web browser supporting 3D gaming with GPU acceleration, then you can use the Facebook app within the browser.

We found it relatively easy to shoot down enemies using the mouse, which seemed to give us some advantage over players using different devices.

**Graphics and Audio**

The free 3rd person shooter game has superb graphics that make characters come to life on iOS and Android devices. However, the appearance is not as great on the PC screen as it is on the smaller screens even at high resolutions. The menu icons are not that sharp, and the textures are rather bland when compared to mobile versions. Hopefully, future releases will feature improved graphics since the game was originally developed for mobile devices.

The audio is great and we didn't experience any problems with our audio system.

**Gameplay**

Although PC gamers seem to have an advantage as far as the use of a mouse and keyboard is concerned, Shadowgun ensures all players start from the same basic level. We started with an assault rifle and unlocked other weapons as we played, including shotguns, launchers and grenades. We earned virtual currency as we progressed with our play. Of course, players have the option to make in-game weapon and armor purchases.

We could play in two modes: zone control and death match. Deathmatch is your standard "every man for himself" while Zone control offered us a better tactical approach.

**Conclusion**

Shadowgun: DeadZone is an excellent first person shooter game that is set to attract more players with the latest versions. Although it has some drawbacks, Marek Rabas, CEO of Madfinger Games, explains that they do not intend to compete with AAA titles on the PC but simply want to open up the multiplayer game to new players, particularly those who do not have iOS and Android devices.
