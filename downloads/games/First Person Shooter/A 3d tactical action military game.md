THQ has released for free Full Spectrum Warrior, allowing you to enjoy the PC version of this tactical-action military game developed by Pandemic Studios. 

In the game, players will command and coordinate the actions of two infantry squads leading them through a hostile urban warzone, as they outthink, outmaneuver and battle enemies through thirteen levels of intense combat. In addition, players can also go online and team up with a friend for two-player co-op gameplay.
