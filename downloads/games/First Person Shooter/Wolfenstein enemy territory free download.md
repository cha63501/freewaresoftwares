**Publisher's Description**  
  

From the developer:  
Wolfenstein Enemy Territory is a free, stand alone, downloadable multiplayer
game in which players wage war as Axis or Allies in team-based combat.

Do battle in traditional single scenarios, or wage war through a series of
linked scenarios in a totally new campaign mode. During combat players gain
experience and skill, and through battlefield promotions are awarded
additional abilities that remain persistent across an entire campaign.

Additionally, new character classes like the Covert Ops as well as enhyanced
Engineer allow teams to perform reconnaissance, steal enemy uniforms, and
construct battlefield structures and military installations in the midst of
combat to gain tactical advantages for their team.

All new game modes, maps and communication abilities require players and teams
to develop advanced strategies and tactics in the struggle for front line
domination.
