PC gamers now have the opportunity to enjoy the popular multiplayer game,
Shadowgun: DeadZone. Madfinger Games launched a Facebook app and downloadable
version of the game on July 31, 2013, which makes it truly multi-platform. The
game was originally launched towards the end of 2011 for Android and iOS
devices, and a number of improvements have been made since then.

**Shadowgun: DeadZone Features**

  * Intense tactical multiplayer combat with up to 12 players 
  * Two popular game modes: Deathmatch and Zone Control 
  * Various maps and a selection of 10 playable characters 
  * A wide ranging arsenal of 21 weapons all of which are upgradable 
  * Various items including Medi Kit, Ammo Kit, Flash Grenades, EMP Grenades, Frag Grenades, Sentry Guns and Mines 
  * Daily challenges and rewards 
  * Multilanguage localization (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese) 
  * Talk to your friends in real time with multiplayer voice chat 

**Playing Shadowgun: DeadZone on PC**

We downloaded the installer program and ran it on our PC. The game gave us the
option to log in using an existing account or create a new one. We liked the
fact that we could use the same account across all platforms, which meant we
had access to our bought items, money, gold and ranks irrespective of the
device we used.

If you have a Web browser supporting 3D gaming with GPU acceleration, then you
can use the Facebook app within the browser.

We found it relatively easy to shoot down enemies using the mouse, which
seemed to give us some advantage over players using different devices.

**Graphics and Audio**

The free 3rd person shooter game has superb graphics that make characters come
to life on iOS and Android devices. However, the appearance is not as great on
the PC screen as it is on the smaller screens even at high resolutions. The
menu icons are not that sharp, and the textures are rather bland when compared
to mobile versions. Hopefully, future releases will feature improved graphics
since the game was originally developed for mobile devices.

The audio is great and we didn't experience any problems with our audio
system.

**Gameplay**

Although PC gamers seem to have an advantage as far as the use of a mouse and
keyboard is concerned, Shadowgun ensures all players start from the same basic
level. We started with an assault rifle and unlocked other weapons as we
played, including shotguns, launchers and grenades. We earned virtual currency
as we progressed with our play. Of course, players have the option to make in-
game weapon and armor purchases.

We could play in two modes: zone control and death match. Deathmatch is your
standard "every man for himself" while Zone control offered us a better
tactical approach.

**Conclusion**

Shadowgun: DeadZone is an excellent first person shooter game that is set to
attract more players with the latest versions. Although it has some drawbacks,
Marek Rabas, CEO of Madfinger Games, explains that they do not intend to
compete with AAA titles on the PC but simply want to open up the multiplayer
game to new players, particularly those who do not have iOS and Android
devices.
