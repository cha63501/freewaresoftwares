**Publisher's Description**  
  

Xonotic is a free (GPL), fast-paced first-person shooter that works on
Windows, OS X and Linux. The project is geared towards providing addictive
arena shooter gameplay which is all spawned and driven by the community
itself.

Xonotic is a direct successor of the Nexuiz project with years of development
between them, and it aims to become the best possible open-source FPS (first-
person-shooter) of its kind.

The game is based off the Darkplaces game engine which is originally a quake
modification, though it is now far more advanced over the course of many years
of development. Because of the features of this engine, Xonotic has incredibly
good graphics for an opensource game and is on par with most commercial games
from 2006-2007.

The gameplay is of course slightly inspired by several other games, but it is
essentially a unique mixture of mostly original and different ideas which
really makes the game stand out. It could be considered most similar to Unreal
Tournament and Quake at its heart, especially regarding teamplay and game
mechanics.
