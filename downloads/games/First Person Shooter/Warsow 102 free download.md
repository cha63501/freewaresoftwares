**Publisher's Description**  
  

Set in a futuristic cartoon-like world where rocketlauncher-wielding pigs and
lasergun-carrying cyberpunks roam the streets, Warsow is a completely free
fast-paced first-person shooter (FPS) for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

Speed and movement, that's what Warsow is all about. Like a true cyberathlete
you jump, dash, dodge and walljump your way through the game. Grab those
power-ups before your enemy does, plant the bomb before anyone sees you, and
steal the enemy's flag before anyone knows what's going on!

A handful of popular gametypes come shipped with Warsow, like Capture the
Flag, Team Deathmatch, Clan Arena, Instagib and Duel. Warsow invites you to
add to this list, by creating your own custom gametypes with the brand new
gametype scripting system!
