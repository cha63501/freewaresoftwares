**Publisher's Description**  
  

Outpost 41 is a mix of horror and first-person shooter. It is technically 2D,
but viewed from first person perspective. You command a squad of four
soldiers, proceeding into an abandoned, alien-infested outpost in search of
some invaluable alien artifacts. Lots of surprises and unexpected events await
you on your mission. Are you prepared to take the assignment and journey to
the haunted Outpost 41?

For the best experience, this game should be played at night with lights
turned off and volume turned up. Be warned that this game is not for the
faint-hearted, since it can be quite spooky.

The game supports 2 player CO-OP via split screen / network.
