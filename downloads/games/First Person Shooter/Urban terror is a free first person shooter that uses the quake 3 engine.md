**Publisher's Description**  
  


Urban Terror is a mod turned standalone thatA's on the Quake 3 engine. It features realistic gameplay, much like in Counter Strike, except for a twist: you can jump off of walls and do other crazy things like that. Also, all the weapons are available at spawn, instead of a buy system. The same applies to the equipment. Another interesting idea is instead of realistic looking skins, there are orange and blue teams. 

**Please Note:** Those of you who do not own Quake3 will need to download and install the ioUrbanTerror installer prior to installing the main 550MB file. You can get this file from the [UrbanTerror website](http://www.urbanterror.net) or here: <http://www.gamershell.com/download_18565.shtml>.

The gameplay in Urban Terror is absolutely fantastic, borderline perfect. The weapons connect when theyA're supposed to connect, and not at any other time. Movement is easy to get used to.

**System Requirements:**

  * 64 MB RAM 
  * 8 MB VRAM 
  * Around 650MB disk space 
Obviously the higher your specs the smoother the gameplay.
