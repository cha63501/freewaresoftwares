Outpost 41 is a mix of horror and first-person shooter. It is technically 2D, but viewed from first person perspective. You command a squad of four soldiers, proceeding into an abandoned, alien-infested outpost in search of some invaluable alien artifacts. Lots of surprises and unexpected events await you on your mission. Are you prepared to take the assignment and journey to the haunted Outpost 41? 

For the best experience, this game should be played at night with lights turned off and volume turned up. Be warned that this game is not for the faint-hearted, since it can be quite spooky.
