**Publisher's Description**  
  

THQ has released for free Full Spectrum Warrior, allowing you to enjoy the PC
version of this tactical-action military game developed by Pandemic Studios.

In the game, players will command and coordinate the actions of two infantry
squads leading them through a hostile urban warzone, as they outthink,
outmaneuver and battle enemies through thirteen levels of intense combat. In
addition, players can also go online and team up with a friend for two-player
co-op gameplay.

Full Spectrum Warrior is based on a light infantry-training simulator designed
by Pandemic Studios for the U.S. Army as a tool to reinforce Army combat
doctrine and squad tactics among troops.

**Features:**

  * Authentic 3-D infantry combat game 
  * Unique combination of tactical and action gameplay 
  * Command eight soldiers in real time 
  * Squad equipment reflects real weaponry and equipment currently in use by the U.S. Army 
  * For one or more players using Internet or LAN
