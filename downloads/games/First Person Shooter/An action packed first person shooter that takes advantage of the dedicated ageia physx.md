**Publisher's Description**  
  


**CellFactor: Revolution** is an action-packed first-person shooter that takes advantage of the capabilities of the dedicated AGEIA PhysX processor, but is playable even if you do not have the Physx accelator card. 

With only a select few games available that actually used the PhysX card, it was becoming increasingly difficult for sites like ours to recommend the purchase of the card. 

We were fed GRAW, which really wasnAt all that impressive with PhysX enabled and up until today when Cell Factor is released, the only enjoyable game which is truly enhanced by the PhysX card, was a small game available on ValveAs Steam called RoboBlitz. Now we have Cell Factor and in this editorAs opinion, not a moment too soon.

The back-story isnAt exactly a new one. Not unlike most other sci-fi storylines, the world has been taken over by a mega company called LIMBO. Rather than ramble on and on, letAs get it straight from the horseAs mouth.

"After a series of cataclysmic events, the planet is now dominated by a superpower, known as the L.I.M.B.O Corporation, dedicated only to the advancement of technology A no matter what the human cost. This technology forms the basis of a cybernetic-enhanced humanoid army A the Technocracy, whose telekinetic powers are used to maintain order across the planet. A scattered human resistance fights for one last shred of freedom, tapping into psionic abilities in an attempt to conquer what appears to be an invincible enemy. The gamer can play as characters from both sides of this war.
