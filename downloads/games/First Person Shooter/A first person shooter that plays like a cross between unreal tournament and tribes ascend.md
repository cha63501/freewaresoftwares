**Publisher's Description**  
  


Abnormals is a first person shooter that plays like a cross between Unreal Tournament and Tribes Ascend. The gameplay revolves around two teams of 2-3 players who each get access to a small suite of movement abilities. 

Each power is unique, but the true challenge comes from effectively combining the powers. Using wall walk to charge up a wall, and then super jump will launch you off the wall horizontally. Using super jump and blink will allow you to flank your enemies. Using wall walk and blinking will allow you to teleport through the floor or ceiling. These powers make the game incredibly challenging and fast paced making traversing the game world interesting and dynamic allowing for hundreds of different ways to move around.

Reach new speeds, reach new heights, bend space and gravity. Use and combine the powers in the innovative and intense and fast paced shooter Abnormals.
