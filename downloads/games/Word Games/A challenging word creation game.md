WordBog is a challenging word creation game. Those who enjoy word games such as Boggle and Scrabble will find WordBog addictive. 

Players of WordBog are challenged to create words (up to 9 letters maximum) and use strategy skills to obtain high scores.

The game requires players to take a strategic approach to assemble various combinations of words on a game board comprised of randomly placed letter tiles.

As each valid word is formed, the tiles in the word are removed and the remaining tiles fall into the vacated spaces creating new word possibilities.

Every day, a new puzzle is available. Compete online against the best WordBog players in the world for the highest score.
