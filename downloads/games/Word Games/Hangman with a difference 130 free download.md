**Publisher's Description**  
  

Hangman is the pen-and-paper game we all know and love. Basically, the program
chooses a word from the included dictionary, and you have to guess the letters
in the word. Incorrect guesses lose you a life, and you only have 10 lives
before your man gets hung!

This program is different to others in that it only requires any version of
Windows to run. ItA's interface is simplistic, but the key feature of this
program is the dictionary usage. You can change the dictionary the program
starts with by replacing the contents of the dictionary text file. You can
also change the dictionary inside the game by going to options, where you can
also set the level of difficulty for Hangman. Have fun!

Please note: the dictionary takes a while to load. Under modern computers less
than 4 years old, expect a wait of 30 sec; for those over 4 years old expect a
wait of about a minute. For those with slower computers, it is suggested to
replace the dictionary text file with a smaller one at [the developerA's home
page](http://www.zvyx.co.cc/).
