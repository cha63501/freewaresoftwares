**Publisher's Description**  
  

Boggle is an interesting game and can be very educational. This version of the
game allows you to play and compare your performance with the computer. Graphs
helps in viewing the results.

The game uses the OSPD. Technically savy users can configure the system to use
other dictionaries. You can lookup words based on online dictionaries and
build wordlists. These wordlists can be viewed as flashcards later.

The game has a jumble tool built in - for cases when you are looking for valid
anagrams.
