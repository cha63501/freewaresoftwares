**Publisher's Description**  
  

Tetris is an exciting action game. Throughout the game, Tetris pieces fall
from the top to the bottom of the playing area. When the Tetris pieces form a
solid row of blocks across the playing area, that row vanishes. Because this
is the only way to remove blocks, you should try to form solid rows whenever
possible. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the playing
area. You can manipulate a piece only when it is falling. Falling pieces may
be rotated, moved horizontally, or dropped to the bottom of the playing area.
