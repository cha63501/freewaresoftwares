**Publisher's Description**  
  


This is a Windows 95 Tetris clone game which takes place in the Solar System. Each level is in a different planet that has a different gravity force which causes the blocks to fall faster. The last level is the Sun. The game contains background music and sounds. 

Asteroid Shower is an early game of mine which is a clone of the very popular Tetris game, it features 10 levels and runs on Windows systems.

Back than I was pretty much making my early steps in the world of programming, so creating the mechanics behind a Tetris game was a real achievement for me, the playfield is basically represented as a 2D array and the blocks move about inside of it, the game has to keep track of which areas in the array are free for the blocks to move to and also check if a line has been made in which point it needs to clear this line from the array and pull all the indexes above the created line down, so this was a great challenge and it taught me a lot about programming.
