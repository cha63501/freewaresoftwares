**Publisher's Description**  
  

The rules of this joy-maker are as easy as ABC: you use falling blocks to make
lines without spaces. The more lines you make, the more points you get. This
is the only feature resembling Tetris, as all the rest are truly original. Its
opulent color palette, a great variety of bonuses, 8 cute pets, silky-smooth
mouse control, softly-flowing music make this arcade game an effective
relaxant for anyone, regardless of age and profession.

The storyline goes like this. Cute pets from all walks of life have been
kidnapped, and you have been chosen to free them! The faster you are, the
higher youA'll score each time you rescue a new pet. Here, you can use mouse
control to handle the falling blocks with genuine virtuosity. Two options can
help you adjust your mouse control to fit your playing habits: drop by double
click and instant drop by left click. To make the game more competitive,
select increased start speed and blocks start falling down at a speed faster
than usual.

As you play the game, you can watch your achievements. Simply take a look at
the level progress bar and the combo bar. The level progress bar informs you
on percentage of rescued pets. You need to fill it to go to the next level.
While playing the game, try to fill the combo bar to increase the score
multiplier. The bigger the score multiplier, the higher youA'll score each
time you rescue a pet. WhatA's more, as you proceed from one level to another
more and more new pets appear in the game. You meet such cute pets as the
bouncy frog, the cuddly piggy, the grumpy wolf and others. To rescue pets
quickly you have 7 color bonuses on hand, for example you can rescue piece
columns, rescue identical pets and even rescue all pets.
