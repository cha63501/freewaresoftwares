**Publisher's Description**  
  

SpaceBlocks is a quality re-make of the classic Tetris game.

This version ships with a wonderful space atmosphere, supported by cool sound
effects and great graphics.

Your goal is to arrange the falling blocks in an intelligent way in order to
line them up horizontally without gaps. If a line is completely filled from
left to right, it disappears and the lines above move down. If you donA't get
rid of the lines before the blocks pile up to the top of the playing field,
the game is over.

SpaceBlocks is no longer available for sale and is now freeware.
