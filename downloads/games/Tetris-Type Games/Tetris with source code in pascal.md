**Publisher's Description**  
  


Fully functional Tetris game. In this case the main interest is not all about the game but the algorithms used in it. Though it has been programmed in text mode itA's nontheless interesting. I suppose someone is going to make the graphics part of it - do it if you like. Later it came to me that the program can by made by reducing it to the necessary minimum, this was the fast that contributed to creating the Tetrisl.pas source, light version of Tetris.
