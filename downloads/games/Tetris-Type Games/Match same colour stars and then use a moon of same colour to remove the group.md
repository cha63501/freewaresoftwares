**Publisher's Description**  
  


With a Coloums/Tetris style of gameplay, you must group same colour stars together with a moon to remove them. Creating large groups and combos will send meteors to your opponent (human or AI) which are harder to get rid of. 

Either play against the computer or another player in a head-to-head battle, or with Trial mode get as much score as you can with no opponent or threat from meteors.
