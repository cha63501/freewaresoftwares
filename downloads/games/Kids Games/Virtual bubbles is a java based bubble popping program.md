Virtual Bubbles is a Java based bubble-popping program. 

It is as much fun as bubble wrap, and more environmentally friendly.

This game is well suited to small children - it is very simple, and runs in full-screen mode. The only way to exit is by using a key combination.

As with all Virtual Toybox software, Virtual Bubbles will run on any system **(Mac, Unix/Linux, Windows)** that has Java installed.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. [Get It Here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
