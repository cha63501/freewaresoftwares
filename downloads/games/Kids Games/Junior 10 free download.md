**Publisher's Description**  
  

JuniorA's based on the popular Hangman game, originally titled A'Hangman
JuniorA' I added a speech synthesizer and removed all references to hanging
people as itA's aimed at pre-schoolers, and I didnA't want to frighten them.
In Junior you have to stop all the animals escaping instead.  
  
Just like Hangman, you have to click the letters to guess the word, but this
time you get a picture of the word to guess, and the computer says the word,
as well as pronouncing each guessed letter phonetically, in order to help them
learn how to spell.  
  
If you can teach your kid to point and click a mouse, Junior will teach them
to read and write. If they struggle with the neccessary hand eye co-ordination
to use a mouse, try them on a touchscreen. IA've seen under twoA's reading and
writing on the A'your baby can readA' adverts, and apparently thatA's just a
set of flashcards, and some DVDA's, so Junior and a touchscreen should be
better still, as it requires practically no adult interaction, leaving you
free to do whatever you want as your pre-school toddler happily learns to read
and write.  
  
Seven data files are included in this free distribution with full instructions
in the help file on how to adapt and/or create your own.
