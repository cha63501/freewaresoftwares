**Publisher's Description**  
  

Risk Management resembles the simplest of board games where each player roles
a die and moves their piece ahead accordingly, only here each of the players
can choose from four different ways of calculating how far forward they move
each turn. Over the long run all of these strategies will move you just as far
along the board. The difference between them is whether this movement will be
slow and steady, or jumpy and sporadic.

These four ways are:

  * Low Risk - You move ahead the average of all the dice thrown in that turn.
  * Regular Risk - You move ahead the number of spaces indicated on your own die.
  * Medium Risk - You make a count of any other dice that match your own. As long as at least one other die matches yours, you moves ahead the number of spaces depending on the number of players and the number of matching dice.
  * High - You move ahead only when your roll is at least as large as any other personAs. How far you move ahead depends on the number of players.
