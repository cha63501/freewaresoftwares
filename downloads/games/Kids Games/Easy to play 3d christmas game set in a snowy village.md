**Publisher's Description**  
  


Easy to play 3D game set in a snowy village environment inhabited by Snowmen, Penguins and Fairies. There are 8 large levels each containing 50 Christmas presents that the player has to find. 

Along the way, you will have to negotiate various obstacles, swim with penguins, find keys for doors and gates, catch fairies that carry presents to give to the player or can help the player in other ways. You will have to slide down a ski slope to collect presents, climb ladders, tightrope walk and search a host of locations looking for the lost presents.

Although this was originally made as a ChildrenA's game most feedback for previous versions has been from adults.
