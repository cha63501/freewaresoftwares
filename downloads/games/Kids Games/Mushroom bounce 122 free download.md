**Publisher's Description**  
  

MushRoom Bounce! is a unique, addictive, 2D physics game where you spin, bop,
and ricochet Mushrooms into various holes to clear each level.

Kino Koichi is the Mushroom Bouncer, a bodybuilding mushroom whose job it is
to "bounce" unruly mushrooms that are invading human territory! To keep the
peace between mushroom and human kind, Koichi is on a mission to get the
mushroom outbreak under control. Under ground, above ground, and back in time
-- the mushroom madness is spreading in this addictive, crazy, retro,
mushroom-bopping adventure!

Mushrooms abound out of bounds in this wacky mushroom-bopping adventure, set
in a myriad of different locations... including some that might leave you
scratching your cap. A cafe, the city streets, a desert island, a haunted
house -- You never know where the little shrooms might pop up next!

Cute as they may be, this fungal frenzy is getting out of hand. Time to put
these cute little guys back in their place. Like the bouncer at any exclusive
club, itA's time to bum-rush these mushrooms down whatever convenient hole you
can find!

Join Koichi in level after level of mushroom bouncing fun -- put on your
sunglasses and get bouncing today!

**Features:**

  * Realistic, 2D Physics Action 
  * Like in Basketball or Billiards, a MushroomA's "spin" affects how it bounces 
  * Available for Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux 
  * Gamepad Support 
  * Also supports Keyboard input 
  * Leaderboards and Personal High Scores saved to server 
  * High Quality 28-song Soundtrack 
  * FREE Desktop version includes 26 Levels! 
  * Tons of Variety -- Each level has its own funny details and surprises

P.S. Kinoko = "mushroom" in Japanese. And ichi means "one" so I guess you
could say the BouncerA's name is "Mushroom One".
