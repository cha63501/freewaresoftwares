**Publisher's Description**  
  

Toddler Slides is a simple program that plays sounds and displays images in
full screen mode. The program is for toddlers. Random pictures are displayed
each time a key is pressed. The pictures are accompanied with relevant sounds
and the mouse can be used to draw on the screen.

In addition to the sample images/sounds that come with the program, the user
can also configure toddler slides to display custom images and/or sounds. When
toddler slides is running, all system keys and key combinations are disabled
so, unless they know the password, your children cannot interfere with other
programs and the operating system and your computer is protected.

**Note from FreewareFiles:** The setup program includes 3rd party software which does not have to be installed in order to use the software.
