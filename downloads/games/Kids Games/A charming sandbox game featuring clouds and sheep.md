**Publisher's Description**  
  


Clouds & Sheep is a charming sandbox game featuring, well, clouds and sheep. Excessively cute sheep. The laid-back pace, mellow gameplay and adorable graphics make Clouds & Sheep an ideal game for casual gamers, as well as more serious gamers who want to take a break from the wanton slaughter and crushing challenges of more hardcore game titles. 

If you keep the woolen fluff balls well-fed, healthy and entertained, theyA'll reward you with Happy Points and make lots of little baby sheep. If you neglect them, the bleating ingrates may glower at you or even have the nerve to die off! Luckily, you can spend your Happy Points on lots of different items that make your life easier.

A good shepherd cares for his sheep, especially when theyA're as cute as this particular flock. There is one problem, though: adorable as they may be, theyAre not very smart. If thereA's a poisonous mushroom, theyA'll eat it. When the sun is shining, theyA'll just stand there until they have a heatstroke - and when the weather turns bad, theyA'll happily stand in the rain until they catch a cold.

So in addition to providing for their basic needs like food and water, youA'll also have to save them from their own stupidity. ItAs not all work, though, there is also plenty of play! The walking balls of wool love it when you play and interact with them and thatAs fun and rewarding in its own right.
