**Publisher's Description**  
  


MushRoom Bounce! is a unique, addictive, 2D physics game where you spin, bop, and ricochet Mushrooms into various holes to clear each level. 

Kino Koichi is the Mushroom Bouncer, a bodybuilding mushroom whose job it is to "bounce" unruly mushrooms that are invading human territory! To keep the peace between mushroom and human kind, Koichi is on a mission to get the mushroom outbreak under control. Under ground, above ground, and back in time -- the mushroom madness is spreading in this addictive, crazy, retro, mushroom-bopping adventure!

Mushrooms abound out of bounds in this wacky mushroom-bopping adventure, set in a myriad of different locations... including some that might leave you scratching your cap. A cafe, the city streets, a desert island, a haunted house -- You never know where the little shrooms might pop up next! 

Cute as they may be, this fungal frenzy is getting out of hand. Time to put these cute little guys back in their place. Like the bouncer at any exclusive club, itA's time to bum-rush these mushrooms down whatever convenient hole you can find!

Join Koichi in level after level of mushroom bouncing fun -- put on your sunglasses and get bouncing today!

  * Like in Basketball or Billiards, a MushroomA's "spin" affects how it bounces

P.S. Kinoko = "mushroom" in Japanese. And ichi means "one" so I guess you could say the BouncerA's name is "Mushroom One".
