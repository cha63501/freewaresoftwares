**Publisher's Description**  
  

With 5GWS, you can take full control like never before. Choose your wrestling
promotion and take it to (or keep it at) the top. With unprecedented features,
5GWS lets you run things how you choose and with the sheer number of features,
you can do this in a way that other wrestling games simply have not allowed -
freeware or not.

Though the sequel, 5GWS v2 is in development, 5GWS is still being worked on by
an active community, making the game that little bit better. So if you need
any help with the gameA's features (they can sometimes get a little complex
due to their depth) or just want to keep up with the latest upgrades, pay a
visit our forums.

**Min. System Requirements:**  
Windows XP/Vista with at least 256mb of RAM is suggested, though due to the
low demands of the game and this genre in general, any computer will likely be
able to run the game, so itA'd probably be best to just give it a go, whatever
your computerA's specs.

The gameA's official manual can be found here:

And if you want to keep up-to-date on 5GWS or news on its sequel, as well as
the Wrestling Career game in development (which will of course, both be
freeware), do so on our homepage:

Hope you enjoy the game!
