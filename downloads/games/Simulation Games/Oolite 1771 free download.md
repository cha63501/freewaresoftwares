**Publisher's Description**  
  

Oolite is a space sim game, inspired by Elite, powered by Objective-C and
OpenGL, and designed as a small game that is easy for users to pick up, modify
and expand upon. Almost every aspect of the game can be changed by using
simple, free graphics packages and text editors.

Originally written for Mac OS X, and under continuous development for over
five years, Oolite is available for Mac OS X (10.3.9 and higher) and PCs
running Windows XP, Windows Vista or Linux. It requires at least a 400 MHz
processor, 256 MiB of memory, and a graphics card capable of accelerating
OpenGL graphics.

The game and source code are offered for free under the GNU General Public
License.
