**Publisher's Description**  
  

Future Pinball is a real time Pinball Development System. It allows you to
design and play your very own pinball simulation in True real time 3D. It uses
Advanced Physics to provide the best possible Simulation of a true to life
pinball machine.

Tables are built up out of Standard components (Plastics, Pegs, Bumpers,
Lights etc..) which are placed onto the playfield via the Editor. Objects like
Surfaces, Lights and Rubbers are shapeable within the editor and generated
real-time when the table is played. Other objects (Bumpers, Flippers, Gates,
Triggers, Targets etc..) use pre-made 3d Models (of which there is a nice
selection of each type).

The Table logic is scripted in Visual Basic Scripting (via the Microsoft
Scripting TechnologyA's built into Microsoft Windows). Scripting is designed
to be simple but flexible enough to allow a wide vararity of Original Games to
be created. Only a limited subset of the Visual Basic Scripting Language is
used as a lot of extra functionality is provided by the game engine.

Full Sound / Music Support is also provided with multiple Music Channels to
allow cross fading.

As Future Pinball is a Game Construction Program it contains some advanced
concepts which may require a little bit of time (and patience) to learn and
fully understand (such as computer graphics and scripting concepts).

**Note:** User designed Tables are also [available for download at the developerA's website](http://www.futurepinball.com/).
