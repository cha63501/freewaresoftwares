**Publisher's Description**  
  

Acidbomb is a fifty level game where you must find the pistons used to trigger
a bomb and defuse them before time runs out. There are many bombs scattered
around the world, from biological bombs that have hair-sensitive triggers to
napalm bombs that are exploding at the seams, to nuclear warheads that have
challenged even the highest trained bomb defusal agent.  
  
Along with this game you get the Virtual Bomb Simulator which allows you to
make your own bombs, and a minigame called Ac!drop that is completely
different from the rest of the game...but youA'll see that for yourself.  
  
Given that all the bombs in the game have random pistons, you will never EVER
solve a bomb the same way twice. Ever.
