**Publisher's Description**  
  

Taiga Racer is a motor cycle simulator that enables you to define your own
motor cycles and ride them on a forest road (hence the name Taiga Racer) with
or without traffic. It features highly realistic physics and a number of
driving aids such as anti-fall and anti-spin to battle the lack of sensory
input which arises when moving motor cycle driving from reality to the
computer.

To be able to play you need at least two absolute controller axes but a three
axis force feedback joystick is highly recommended as this gives you more
control over the clutch and enables you to take advantage of a driving aid
that has been implemented using the force feedback functionality.
