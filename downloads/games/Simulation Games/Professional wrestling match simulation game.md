**Publisher's Description**  
  


Pro Wrestling Nexus: Complete is a remake of the previous professional wrestling match simulation game, Pro Wrestling Nexus: Singles Competition, which is no longer supported nor available for download. 

Unlike some match simulators which generate the happenings of a match in a text file, Pro Wrestling Nexus provides an interface which allows you to watch the match play-by-play.

The game features a damage system where each wrestler has a set level of hit points or health and each move has a set amount of damage done. PWN: Complete provides a singles and tag team wrestling environment in which you can pit two wrestlers or teams against each other in order to see who comes out on top.

  * Features 350 professional wrestlers to choose from. 
  * Create and defend championship belts. 
  * Create your own wrestler and see how their measure up to the others. 
  * Keep track of wins, losses and title history. 
  * Cheats include the ability for wrestlers to interfere and much more.
