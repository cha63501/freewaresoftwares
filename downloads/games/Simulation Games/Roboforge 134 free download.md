**Publisher's Description**  
  

Roboforge is an opensource game mix of simulation game/strategy
game/educational game.  
  
You can create 3D virtual robot, give them AI and then make them fights vs
other robot.  
  
The game can be split into the following steps:  
  
**1\. Build your own 3D virtual robot**  
You can connect robot parts just like LEGO.  
The components to be connected together are:  
\- engine  
\- controller  
\- sensors  
\- mobile joints  
\- weapons  
\- shields  
  
The robot can be "humanoid", "bug styled" or whatelse you can imagine, itA's
up to You.  
  
**2\. Define movements**  
You just need to take successive snapshots of the parts to be moved  
  
**3\. Create your robotA's AI**  
Roboforge do not use any particular language (so You donA't need to be a
programmer) but simple functional blocks that describes what your robot should
do: move towards enemy, attack,etc. ..  
  
Please note that AI is the only way to control your robot, thereA's no way to
control it through joypads or keyboard. So You have to make your robot skilled
enough to look for enemy, attack it, hit with weapons or run away.  
This is probaly the most actractive feature of roboforge: your robot takes
life!  
  
**4\. Test your robot**  
Before entering the robot into a tournament You can test it vs some demo
robot/test robot directly included in the game.  
You can also challenge another forger ONline into the challenge room (useful
to test your robot vs best player).  
  
**5\. Enter your robot into a tournament**  
Tournaments run regularly every 2...3 days.  
Tournament are completly free of charge.  
The tournament run offline, so You can create/test/modify your robots when You
have time and then just enter them into next tournaments.  
ItA's not required your presence ONLine during the tournament.  
  
**6\. View tournaments results**  
When the Tournament is complete You can wiew all your battles and results (3d
