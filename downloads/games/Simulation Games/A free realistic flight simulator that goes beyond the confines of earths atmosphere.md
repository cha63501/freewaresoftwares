**Publisher's Description**  
  


Orbiter is a free, realistic flight simulator that goes beyond the confines of EarthA's atmosphere. Launch the Space Shuttle from Kennedy Space Center to deploy a satellite, rendezvous with the International Space Station or take the futuristic Delta-glider for a tour through the solar system - the choice is yours. 

But make no mistake - ORBITER is not a space shooter. The emphasis is firmly on realism, and the learning curve can be steep. Be prepared to invest some time and effort to brush up on your orbital mechanics background.

**Features:**

  * Launch the Space Shuttle from Kennedy Space Center and rendezvous with the International Space Station. 
  * Recreate historic flights with addon spacecraft packages: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Vostok and more. 
  * Plan interplanetary slingshots and tour the solar system with futuristic space craft. 
  * Design your own rockets, or download addons created by other users. 
  * Learn about the concepts of space flight and orbital mechanics by playing and experimenting.
