**Publisher's Description**  
  

An all new Flight Simulator experience awaits you at Bear Creek. This is a
completely re-vamped "Extreme Make Over" of the previous Bear Creek Winery &
Lodging.

Some additions include: Scenery Changer Utility, Custom Textures, Festive
Events (Christmas, Balloon Festival Etc.). Also added enhanced AI Traffic to
the whole of Bear Creek. If you are a previous user of the original Bear Creek
scenery this one that awaits you will indeed replace the original!! No need to
keep the previous version 1.0 that you may have downloaded this 2.0 version is
a whole new interface that utilizes different install criteria.

Some of the Extra additions that are used with the new 2.0 version are:
Runway12 3 Part Library, the Abacus Scenery Creator default libraries, Lago
FSE, AI Schweizer 300C Helicopter, Gerrish Grey Tree Library Version 3. The
direct links to these downloads are provided to you to download to display the
scenery in its entirety. Not all of the above mentioned are required, like
Lago, as it is a payware addition. All others mentioned are freely distributed
at various download sites. Please follow the installation instructions very
carefully.

Do not attempt to install this scenery with a "scenery manager" - for proper
installation please use the built in installation routine. Enjoy the newest
edition: Airport Code: BCWL near Homer, Alaska.
