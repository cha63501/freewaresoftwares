**Publisher's Description**  
  

The FlightGear flight simulator project is an open-source, multi-platform,
cooperative flight simulator development project. Source code for the entire
project is available and licensed under the GNU General Public License.

The goal of the FlightGear project is to create a sophisticated flight
simulator framework for use in research or academic environments, for the
development and pursuit of other interesting flight simulation ideas, and as
an end-user application. We are developing a sophisticated, open simulation
framework that can be expanded and improved upon by anyone interested in
contributing.

There are many exciting possibilities for an open, free flight sim. We hope
that this project will be interesting and useful to many people in many areas.

Project Overview  
FlightGear is a free flight simulator project. It is being developed through
the gracious contributions of source code and spare time by many talented
people from around the globe. Among the many goals of this project are the
quest to minimize short cuts and "do things right", the quest to learn and
advance knowledge, and the quest to have better toys to play with.

The idea for Flight Gear was born out of a dissatisfaction with current
commercial PC flight simulators. A big problem with these simulators is their
proprietariness and lack of extensibility. There are so many people across the
world with great ideas for enhancing the currently available simulators who
have the ability to write code, and who have a desire to learn and contribute.
Many people involved in education and research could use a spiffy flight
simulator frame work on which to build their own projects; however, commercial
simulators do not lend themselves to modification and enhancement. The Flight
Gear project is striving to fill these gaps.

There are a wide range of people interested and participating in this project.
This is truly a global effort with contributors from just about every
continent. Interests range from building a realistic home simulator out old
airplane parts, to university research and instructional use, to simply having
a viable alternative to commercial PC simulators.

Flight Gear and its source code have intentionally been kept open, available,
and free. In doing so, we are able to take advantage of the efforts of
tremendously talented people from around the world. Contrast this with the
traditional approach of commercial software vendors, who are limited by the
collective ability of the people they can hire and pay. Our approach brings
its own unique challenges and difficulties, but we are confident (and other
similarly structured projects have demonstrated) that in the long run we can
outclass the commercial "competition."

Contributing to Flight Gear can be educational and a lot of fun. A long time
developer, Curtis Olson, had this to say about working on Flight Gear:

Personally, Flight Gear has been a great learning experience for me. I have
been exposed to many new ideas and have learned a tremendous amount of "good
stuff" in the process of discussing and implementing various Flight Gear
subsystems. If for no other reason, this alone makes it all worth while.
