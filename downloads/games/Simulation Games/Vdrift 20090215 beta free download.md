**Publisher's Description**  
  

VDrift is a cross-platform, open source driving simulation made with drift
racing in mind. The driving physics engine was recently re-written from
scratch but was inspired and owes much to the Vamos physics engine. It is
released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2. It is currently
available for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Windows.

This game is in the early stages of development but is already very playable.
Currently the game features:

  * Over 20 tracks, almost 30 cars 
  * Simple networked multiplayer mode (currently disabled, waiting to be rewritten) 
  * Very realistic physics 
  * Mouse/joystick/gamepad/wheel/keyboard support 
  * Fully modeled tracks, scenery and terrain 
  * Several different camera modes 
  * Basic replay system with Skip Forward/Skip Backward 
  * Fully customizable controls 
  * Joystick, mouse and keyboard input filtering 
  * Brake lights 
  * Driver aids: automatic shifting, traction control, anti-lock braking 
  * Experimental force feedback
