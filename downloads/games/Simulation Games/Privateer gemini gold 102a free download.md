**Publisher's Description**  
  

Many of us experienced Privateer in the early 90A's, the engaging space piracy
and trading game that captured us with mystery and challenges.

Some contemporary efforts tried bringing back the Privateer joy of years past,
but all have been limited by the blocky 320x200 pixel art in the game. The
competing Privateer Gemini Gold has just released a new Open Source Privateer
to all platforms with the inflight and ground art redone at 800x600 as well as
with all the familiar controls that were baked into the base scenes and
immersed the player in the scenes.

Just like the original, you start poor, with an old scout class ship in a
sparsely populated system in the Gemini Sector. As usual, you must try to get
money through various mission assignments from which you can purchase better
ships and upgrades. ItA's your choice how to explore Gemini and align with the
various factions, earn your money as a merchant, bounty hunter, traitor or
pirate. Meet Sandoval in a bar on New Detroit and talk to him to trigger the
original campaign and the newer Righteous Fire expansion.

Version 1.02a is basically a polished 1.02 release based on the bugreports and
feedback that reached us during the last four weeks.

Downloads for Linux and MacOS are available from the [developerA's
website](http://priv.solsector.net/files.htm).
