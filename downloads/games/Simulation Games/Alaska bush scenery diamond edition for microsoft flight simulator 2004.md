**Publisher's Description**  
  


An all new Flight Simulator experience awaits you at Bear Creek. This is a completely re-vamped "Extreme Make Over" of the previous Bear Creek Winery & Lodging. 

Some additions include: Scenery Changer Utility, Custom Textures, Festive Events (Christmas, Balloon Festival Etc.). Also added enhanced AI Traffic to the whole of Bear Creek. If you are a previous user of the original Bear Creek scenery this one that awaits you will indeed replace the original!! No need to keep the previous version 1.0 that you may have downloaded this 2.0 version is a whole new interface that utilizes different install criteria. 

Some of the Extra additions that are used with the new 2.0 version are: Runway12 3 Part Library, the Abacus Scenery Creator default libraries, Lago FSE, AI Schweizer 300C Helicopter, Gerrish Grey Tree Library Version 3. The direct links to these downloads are provided to you to download to display the scenery in its entirety. Not all of the above mentioned are required, like Lago, as it is a payware addition. All others mentioned are freely distributed at various download sites. Please follow the installation instructions very carefully. 

Do not attempt to install this scenery with a "scenery manager" - for proper installation please use the built in installation routine. Enjoy the newest edition: Airport Code: BCWL near Homer, Alaska.
