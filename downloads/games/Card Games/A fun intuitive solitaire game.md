**Publisher's Description**  
  


Tower Solitaire is a fun and intuitive solitaire game inspired by Tripeaks and Golf Solitaire. 

In Tower Solitaire you must try to make the medieval tower magically appear by removing all the cards dealt at the beginning. The game is fairly simple in concept, but to be a good player it will be necessary to combine strategy and planning to use the wild cards well to complete as many deals as possible.

Tower Solitaire plays in exactly the same as Tripeaks Solitaire, but of course this game has a more challenging layout and lots of wild cards to play!
