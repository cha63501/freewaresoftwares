**Publisher's Description**  
  

Briscola Mano a Mano is based on an old world classic, rendered in C#. The
latest version consists of two game play environments; designated as Solitaire
and the Inter-Connected User Console or the ICU Console.

Although BMMA's Solitaire was designed to be an offline gaming simulator, its
evolution has produced the ICU Console. As its name implies, the ICU Console
allows you to play Briscola online with anyone on BMMA's Gaming Network.

Regardless of the environment used, both include non-volatile operation, high-
level interactivity and animated game play and are packaged in customizable
environments.
