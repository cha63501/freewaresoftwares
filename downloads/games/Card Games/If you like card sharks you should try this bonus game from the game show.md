**Publisher's Description**  
  


Card Sharks ran from 1978 to 1981 on NBC and from 1986 to 1989 on CBS. Both versions included a bonus game called "Money Cards". Though there were slight variations in rules during each incarnation, the basic premise remained the same: If you were willing to wager big, you could win thousands of dollars just by predicting if the next card in a sequence would be higher or lower. 

This version of Money Cards is closer to the CBS version. The player is given $200 to start and receives another $400 on the second row of cards. You may "change" a card once per row, but you may change any card, not just your base card.
