Simple Club is a special purpose bridge program primarily a teaching tool for
the Simplified Club bidding system. It allows you to bid the South hand with
the computer bidding the other three hands, and it provides a brief
explanation of the reasons for each bid it makes. You can also play the hands.
You do need to learn the Simplified Club system to use the program
effectively, but the basics of the system can be picked up in about 15 minutes
by someone who knows how to play bridge.
