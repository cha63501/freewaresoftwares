Scopa Mano a Mano is based on an old-world, card game; rendered in C#. The latest version consists of two game play environments. They are designated as Solitaire and the Internet SMM Console or the ISMM Console. Although Scopa Mano a ManoA's Solitaire was designed to be an offline gaming simulator, it is complimented by the ISMM Console. As its name implies, the ISMM Console allows you to play Scopa online with anyone on Scopa Mano a ManoA's Gaming Network. Regardless of the environment used, both include non-volatile operation, high-level interactivity and animated game play and are packaged in customizable environments.
