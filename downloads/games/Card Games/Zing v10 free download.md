**Publisher's Description**  
  

The objective of the "Zing" game (sometimes called "Pishti") is to achieve
particular number of points (101, 201 or 501) depending on game type started.
Players drop cards in turns and if someone drops a card over the card of the
same number (not sign) he takes all the cards from the table. If there is only
one card on the table at that time, itA's called a "zing". Jack takes all
cards from the table. If someone made zing of jacks (jack over the jack),
thatA's called a "double zing".
