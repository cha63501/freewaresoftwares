**Publisher's Description**  
  


The object of this game is to put all the cards to the foundation (the top 4 piles). The foundation piles must be built up from A to K with cards of the same suit. There are 7 tableau piles (the lower 7 piles). Initially, the cards are dealt here, some of the cards will be covered and some of the cards will be opened. Each time you can move a column of cards from a tableau pile. You can put the column of cards on another tableau pile if the last card of the tableau pile is of different colour and is one point bigger than the first card of the column. When the last card of a tableau pile is coverd, you can uncover it by clicking it. When a tableau pile becomes empty, you can drag a K (together with the entire column of cards on top of that K) to fill the position.
