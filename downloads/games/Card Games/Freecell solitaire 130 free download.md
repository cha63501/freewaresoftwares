**Publisher's Description**  
  

The aim of this game is to move all the cards to the foundation (the top right
position). You will have 8 piles of opened tableau cards to begin with. The
foundation piles must be built from cards of the same suit and in ascending
order. You can move a card to a tableau pile only if the pile is empty or if
the top card in the pile is one point larger and has the same colour as the
card you want to put. You can put one card to any of the four cells.

**Requires:** [Adobe AIR](http://www.freewarefiles.com/Adobe-AIR_program_42448.html).
