**Publisher's Description**  
  

Net.Tarot is a challenging cross-platform trick-taking card game that requires
four players and uses the traditional 78-card tarot deck.

Net.Tarot provides multiplayer support and is compatible with numerous mobile
and desktop platforms. In addition, Net.Tarot comes with A'robotsA' that will
test your gaming skills.

The game is localised in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Dutch.

Current development has been focused on the multiplayer part of the game,
which means that everything has been done to ease human players to reach each
others.

For instance, a game hosted and running from a PC can be joined by anyone on
any type of device, from computers to smartphones!! IA've also added
A'RobotsA' for single play and they are playing quite well for a first
implementation and for a future update, iA've got plans for better robots
using a A'neuron networkA' that will be able to play as professionals!

Of course, there are many more features to come such as support more platforms
like IOS, Samsung Bada, WebOS, Mac OSX and so on... But also a landscape mode
for mobile devices, online ranking system, better robots and more, of course
all updates and new stuff will depend on your interest and support for
Net.Tarot.

Others clients versions are available for download on Net.Tarot website!
