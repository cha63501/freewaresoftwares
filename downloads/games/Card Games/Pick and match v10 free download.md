**Publisher's Description**  
  

Pick and Match is designed to simulate the old card matching memory game. Pick
and Match starts by allowing you to choose between two sets of cards. Playing
Pick and Match helps to increase visual recall. Children as well as adults
will enjoy playing Pick and Match. Pick and Match counts your mouse clicks and
keeps track of the length of time it takes to match all the pairs. The better
your memory the fewer mouse clicks and usually a shorter time to complete a
game.
