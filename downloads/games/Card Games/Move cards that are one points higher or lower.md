**Publisher's Description**  
  


In this game there will be a number of cards listed in the shape of three peaks while the cards in the bottom row are opened. Your job is to move away all the cards from the three peaks. You can only move a card that is adjacent (A and K are also considered to be adjacent) to the top card in the waste pile (the opened pile at the bottom). As cards are moved away from the peaks, cards that are no longer blocked by other cards can be opened. When no cards can be moved, you can open a card in the tableau (the covered cards at the bottom) and put it on the waste pile. When all the cards in the tableau are used and no more cards can be moved, then you lose the game.
