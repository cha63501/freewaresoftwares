At the start of this game 11 cards will be dealt as the reserve cards (also
known as the terrace) and 4 cards will be dealt to the tableau (the bottom
piles). First, you need to decide the base card of the foundation by dragging
one of the cards to the foundation (the middle piles). After that, cards will
be dealt to the empty tableau and the game starts. The object is to move all
the cards to the foundation (built up in alternate colours, wrapping from K to
A if necessary).
