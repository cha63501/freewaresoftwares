**Publisher's Description**  
  


Golf is one of the classic and best known solitaire card games. It was originally called One Foundation, because the object is to play all of the cards to a single pile. 

At some point the name was changed to Golf. Probably this was because the game is hard to win, therefore various methods of scoring have been developed for the game, where beating a certain score means you made par for that hand.
