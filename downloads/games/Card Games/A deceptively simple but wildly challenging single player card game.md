**Publisher's Description**  
  


Not many card games require a save game feature, but then not many card games are like Bergman. The game starts simple enough, you and the computer each have five cards and all you have to do is be the first player to have zero cards. A lucky few may manage to quickly discard those five cards, but more than likely the the card count will grow and the challenge that is Bergman will begin!
