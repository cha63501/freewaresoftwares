**Publisher's Description**  
  

In this solitaire card game you need to move all the cards to the 8 foundation
piles at the upper right corner. The foundation piles must be built in suit
from A to K. You can use the tableau piles (the middle 10 piles) to hole the
cards temporarily while you build up the cards in the foundation piles.

Each time you can only move the top card in a tableau pile, and you can put a
card in a tableau pile only if it has the same suit and is 1 point smaller
than the top card in the pile. There is a stock card on the top left and you
can click the pile and turn a card to the waste pile. You can move the top
card from the waste pile to the foundation or tableau piles.

When you have used all the stock cards, and you still cannot put all the cards
to the foundation, then you lose the game.
