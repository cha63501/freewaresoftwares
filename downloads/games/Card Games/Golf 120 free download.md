**Publisher's Description**  
  

Golf is one of the classic and best known solitaire card games. It was
originally called One Foundation, because the object is to play all of the
cards to a single pile.

At some point the name was changed to Golf. Probably this was because the game
is hard to win, therefore various methods of scoring have been developed for
the game, where beating a certain score means you made par for that hand.
